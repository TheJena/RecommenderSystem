The two superheroes are initially introduced when Clark Kent interviews Bruce Wayne for a feature in theDaily Planet, and their alter egos cross paths again as Batman and Superman are drawn into Lex Luthor's dastardly scheme for world domination.

        "006114665X": "The immense documentation of the origin of WWI, remarks historian Clark, can be marshaled to support a range of theses, and it but weakly sustains, in the tenor of his intricate analysis, the temptation to assign exclusive blame for the cataclysm to a particular country. Dispensing with a thesis, Clark interprets evidence in terms of the character, internal political heft, and external geopolitical perception and intention of a political actor. In other words, Clark centralizes human agency and, especially, human foibles of misperception, illogic, and emotion in his narrative. Touching on every significant figure in European diplomacy in the decade leading to August 1914, Clark underscores an entanglement of an official&#x2019;s fluctuating domestic power with a foreign interlocutor&#x2019;s appreciation, accurate or not, of that official&#x2019;s ability to make something stick in foreign policy. As narrative background, Clark choreographs the alliances and series of crises that preceded the one provoked by the assassination of Franz Ferdinand, but he focuses on the men whose risk-taking mistakes detonated WWI. Emphasizing the human element, Clark bestows a tragic sensibility on a magisterial work of scholarship. --Gilbert Taylor",

It's a tough read, but definitely a worthwhile one, and the author's personality and strength shine through on every page. Covering the years from 1975 to 1979, the story moves from the deaths of multiple family members to the forced separation of the survivors, leading ultimately to the reuniting of much of the family, followed by marriages and immigrations. The brutality seems unending--beatings, starvation, attempted rape, mental cruelty--and yet the narrator (a young girl) never stops fighting for escape and survival. Sad and courageous, her life and the lives of her young siblings provide quite a powerful example of how war can so deeply affect children--especially a war in which they are trained to be an integral part of the armed forces. For anyone interested in Cambodia's recent history, this book shares a valuable personal view of events.--Jill Lightner",

This may be the most complete mathematical explanation of the universe yet published, and Roger Penrose richly deserves the accolades he will receive for it. That said, let us be perfectly clear: this is not an easy book to read. The number of people in the world who can understandeverythingin it could probably take a taxi together to Penrose's next lecture. Still, math-friendly readers looking for a substantial and possibly even thrillingly difficult intellectual experience should pick up a copy (carefully--it's over a thousand pages long and weighs nearly 4 pounds) and start at the beginning, where Penrose sets out his purpose: to describe \"the search for the underlying principles that govern the behavior of our universe.\" Beginning with the deceptively simple geometry of Pythagoras and the Greeks, Penrose guides readers through the fundamentals--the incontrovertible bricks that hold up the fanciful mathematical structures of later chapters. From such theoretical delights as complex-number calculus, Riemann surfaces, and Clifford bundles, the tour takes us quickly on to the nature of spacetime. The bulk of the book is then devoted to quantum physics, cosmological theories (including Penrose's favored ideas about string theory and universal inflation), and what we know about how the universe is held together. For physicists, mathematicians, and advanced students,The Road to Realityis an essential field guide to the universe. For enthusiastic amateurs, the book is a project to tackle a bit at a time, one with unimaginable intellectual rewards.--Therese Littleton--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

Featuring detailed environments and complicated new battle mechanisms, this game demands a different kind of perspective than the first-person shooters from the original Halo series. You'll need to uncover the hidden strengths and weaknesses of each unit and play them to your tactical advantage, and that's just the beginning.UNSC: Be Part of a Legendary ConflictThe story opens with UNSC forces retaking the planet Harvest from the Covenant. At your disposal -- should you choose to take command of UNSC forces -- will be everything from a corps of highly-trained Marines to the Warthogs, Scorpions, and Hornets you'll need for air and land attacks. You'll take stock of the map and decide between holding your ground or advancing on enemy strongholds, all while trying to navigate the local terrain and outsmart Covenant forces. And when you need something extra to tip the tide in your favor, UNSC leaders can provide you with the ability to mobilize highly specialized units or call the Spirit of Fire vessel for support from above.Covenant: A Capable, Playable Enemy FactionThat's right, Covenant is playable in this corner of the Halo universe. This alliance of alien species has manipulated advanced technology, firepower, and tactical prowess into a powerful force that is engaged in a Genocidal war against human race, having branded humans as heretics. With the ability to play as these tough, alien fighters, you'll have advanced shield technology, the modular Citadel at the heart of Covenant's colonizing power, and, of course, the iconic Scarab attack vehicle at your disposal, adding a whole new dimension to your strategic warfare. The Scarab is a terrifying military vehicle crafted from heavy mining equipment. And with a mining laser that delivers massive damage across battlefields large and small, turrets for taking on air attacks, and the ability to clamber over any terrain, what's not to love about commanding Scarabs instead of fighting against them?Developed Exclusively for Xbox 360Most console RTS games are adapted from existing PC games, which can make their controls bulky or awkward, butHalo Warshas been developed for Xbox 360 from the ground up. This means the controls are sensitive, intuitive, and easy-to-operate in the midst of battle.

        "0062009494": "*Starred Review* On a stormy night in early Victorian London, an able young man named Dodger rises from the sewers in response to a scream, fights off two thugs, and rescues a damsel in distress. Dodger continues to rise throughout the novel, as his love for the mysterious lady motivates this tosher (scavenger for lost coins and other treasures in London&#x2019;s sewers) to elevate himself and leads him to a closer acquaintance with a string of historical figures, including Dickens, Disraeli, and ultimately, the queen and her consort. While most writers would be well advised not to include such characters in their books, Pratchett manages to humanize them without diminishing them or throwing the story off-kilter. However lowly Dodger&#x2019;s origins, he remains the most memorable character in the book. Living by his wits and unencumbered by conventional morality, this trickster hero expertly navigates the underbelly of his city as he carries out a bizarre scheme resulting in justice and mercy. The temptation to quote sentences, whole paragraphs, and possibly entire chapters is almost irresistible, because the pleasure of reading the novel is in the language as much as in the characters and well-researched period setting. Often amusing, this Victorian romp of a novel is lovingly crafted and completely enjoyable. Grades 8-12. --Carolyn Phelan",
        "0062113763": "Leganski explores the flip side of silence in this deceptively quiet first novel. Born in the aftermath of a searing family tragedy, Bonaventure Arrow &#x201C;didn&#x2019;t make a peep when he was born.&#x201D;  Never speaking a word, his silence enables him to listen to what no one else can hear. He is not only hyper-aware of the sounds of the natural world, but he is also in tune with the clamorous echoes of  personal heartbreak and despair. Joining forces with Creole servant Trinidad Prefontaine, young Bonaventure undertakes a quest to unlock a series of family secrets to liberate himself, his dead father, and his inconsolable mother from the emotionally and spiritually paralyzing bonds of the past. This mystical fairy tail set in a 1950s-era Louisiana rife with religion, superstition, and tradition draws you in from the wondrous first page. Silence has never been so boundlessly eloquent. --Margaret Flanagan",

        "0061558265": "Amazon Guest Review: Stephen King onThe Night EternalStephen Kingis the author of more than 50 books, all of them worldwide best-sellers. Among his most recent are theDark Towernovels,Cell,From a Buick 8,Everything's Eventual,Hearts in Atlantis,The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, andBag of Bones. He is the recipient of the 2003 National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters. He lives in Bangor, Maine, with his wife, novelist Tabitha King.The Straintrilogy opened with an authentic wow moment: a Boeing 777 arrives at JFK airport with all but four of the passengers dead in their seats. The flashlight beams of the first responders &ldquo;registered dully in the dead jewels of their open eyes.&rdquo; Not much later these corpses begin to rise from their morgue slabs, and a plague of blood-hungry predators overwhelms New York. The first hundred pages ofThe Strainis a sustained exercise in terror that held this reader in spellbound delight, because del Toro and Hogan write with crisp authenticity about both the fantastical (vampires) and the completely real (New York City, with all its odd nooks and crannies).What began inThe Straincomes to a sublimely satisfying conclusion inThe Night Eternal. Del Toro and Hogan have taken Dracula, the greatest vampire tale of them all, and deftly turned it inside out. In Stoker&rsquo;s novel, Bloodsucker Zero arrives in England on a sailing ship called the Demeter. As with the Regis Air 777, the Demeter is a ghost ship when it reaches port, the eponymous Count having snacked his way across the ocean. The difference is that Dracula is confronted by a heroic band of vampire-hunters who eventually drive him from England by using modern technology&mdash;everything from diaries kept on wax recording cylinders to blood transfusions. InThe StrainTrilogy, the body-hopping Master&mdash;who arrives at JFK in the person of Polish nobleman Jusef Sardu&mdash;uses the very technology that defeated his honorable forebear to destroy the civilized world. Big corporations are his tools; modern transportation serves to spread the vampire virus; nuclear weapons usher in a new era of pollution and atmospheric darkness.Only jolly old England escapes; the wily Brits have blown up the Chunnel early on, and remain relatively vampire-free. At moments like this, the reader senses del Toro and Hogan tucking their tongues in their cheeks and having a gleeful blast.When speaking of the New World Order in Henry the Sixth, Shakespeare has one of his characters say, &ldquo;The first thing we do, let&rsquo;s kill all the lawyers.&rdquo; As TheNight Eternalopens, the Master (currently having traded the body of Sardu for that of rock star Gabriel Bolivar) doubles down on that, ordering his minions to kill not just those in the legal profession but all the CEOs, tycoons, intellectuals, rebels, and artists.  &ldquo;Their execution was swift, public and brutal. Out they marched, the damned, out of the River House, the Dakota, the Beresford and their ilk&hellip;in a horrific pageant of carnage, they were disposed of.&rdquo;With the exception of heroic pawnbroker/scholar Abraham Setrakian (who almost destroyed the Master in Volume Two,The Fall), the winning cast of human characters from the previous novels are all present and accounted for: Nora Martinez, who has traded in her scientist&rsquo;s microscope for a silver sword; Vasily Fet, who now exterminates vampires instead of rats; Augustin &ldquo;Gus&rdquo; Elizade, once a gangbanger and now a hero of resistance. There&rsquo;s also the less-than-admirable but fascinating (in a repulsive way, it&rsquo;s true) Alfonso Creem, with his insatiable appetite and his vampire-repelling mouthful of silver teeth.And there&rsquo;s Eph Goodweather, the epidemiologist around whom all these others revolve. WhenThe Night Eternalbegins, two years after the Master has used nuclear weapons to create vampire-friendly darkness all over the planet, Eph has fallen on hard times. His undead ex-wife stalks him relentlessly (he is, after all, one of her &ldquo;Dear Ones&rdquo;), his son has become a rifle-toting, obsessive-compulsive acolyte of the Master, and Eph himself has started popping Vicodin and oxycodone. Nora has left him for Vasily Fet, and Eph is viewed with distrust by those who used to rally around him. Justifiable distrust; he keeps showing up late for meetings and vampire-killing gigs.Fet has managed to purchase a rogue nuke (it&rsquo;s wrapped in garbage bags and looks like a trashcan), and the resistance fighters have a sacred book that may&mdash;if deciphered&mdash;lead them to the Black Site where the Master&rsquo;s earthly life began. If they can destroy that holy soil, they believe the vampire plague will end.There&rsquo;s a certain amount of perhaps dispensable hugger-mugger about vampires in Rome and archangels in Sodom, but the main attractions here are the resistance fighters&rsquo; fierce dedication to their cause, and Eph Goodweather&rsquo;s slow and painful realization that if he destroys the Master, he may also destroy his son Zachary, the last person on earth he truly loves. Heroes of tragic dimension are rare in popular fiction, but Goodweather fills the bill nicely.After a small (and perhaps unavoidable&mdash;see Tolkein&rsquo;s The Two Towers) letdown inThe Fall,The StrainTrilogy comes to a rip-roaring conclusion inThe Night Eternal. The action is non-stop, and the fantasy element is anchored in enough satisfying detail to make it believable. All the New York landmarks, such as Central Park&rsquo;s Belvedere Castle and The Cloisters, are real. And while you&rsquo;re discovering such essential vampire facts as the undead&rsquo;s inability to cross running water without human help, you&rsquo;ll also find out that the stone lions outside the New York Public Library have names: Patience and Fortitude. Plus, come on, admit it&mdash;there&rsquo;s something about seeing vampires massing for an attack in a Wendy&rsquo;s parking lot that makes them more real. The devil&rsquo;s in the details, and this is one devilishly good read full of satisfying scares. --Stephen King",

After a slow beginning, this sequel clips along satisfyingly, as shop owner Lydia, a cancer survivor, and her no-nonsense sister, Margaret, meet three new and conveniently quite different friends and bond over the complications of life. Overweight, depressed teenager Courtney Pulanski has found herself plopped into a new town for her senior year, living with her grandma while her dad works in Brazil. Bethanne Hamlin, a recent divorc&eacute;e, and Elise Beaumont, who's been single for years, are both still suffering from their broken marriages.

With mind-boggling improvements in graphics, gameplay networking, and interface -- really every category -- this game became the crown prince of the genre. World of Warcraft players will be excited by the approaching release of the new expansion pack:World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade. This pack expands the already massive, award-winning multiplayer online role-playing game by tremendous bounds, adding new races, lands, battlegrounds, professions and items, and much, much more.

There are two new playable races, including the magical Blood Elves that you can read more about below. The other race has not yet been released by Blizzard. There will be new starting zones in Quel'Thalas and beyond. Another eye-opening addition is the entirely new, unexplored continent of Outland that is reachable through the Dark Portal. Plus, you'll find many new high-level dungeons to explore in Azeroth, Outland, and elsewhere that will substantially boost gameplay. There are new flying mounts in Outland; tons of new and dangerous monsters (including epic world bosses); hundreds of new quests and items; and even a new profession: Jewelcrafting. Of course this isn't the end of the list -- this is just a glimpse of what Blizzard has planned for their unreleased expansion pack.The New Story, the Rumors, and MoreSeveral years have passed since the Burning Legion's defeat at Mount Hyjal and the races of Azeroth have continued to rebuild their once shattered lives. With renewed strength, the heroes of the Horde and Alliance have begun to explore new lands, and have broken through the Dark Portal to investigate the realms beyond the known world. In this expansion pack,The Burning Crusaderefers to the Burning Legion's ongoing efforts to destroy life on Azeroth. To date, the Burning Legion's exploits have been documented inWarcraft IIIand in theWar of the Ancientsnovel trilogy. As part of the expansion pack, players will now be able to travel through the Dark Portal to confront the Legion on otherworldly battlefields.Although only one race has been revealed, Blizzard has announced plans to unveil details about possible additional races at a later date. On the other hand, many details have been released about the new continent, Outland. Players last visited Outland inWarcraft III: The Frozen Throne, alongside Illidan as he conquered the Pit Lord Magtheridon's domain. Players will also gain access to Quel'Thalas, the region to the northeast of the Forsaken lands, where the Blood Elves reside. Blizzard says that this expansion pack holds even more new areas that are ripe for player exploration -- additional details will be revealed in the months ahead.Blizzard also has plans to add new dungeons and battlegrounds with the expansion, though the exact number has not yet been determined. One upcoming dungeon that has players excited is Karazhan, which is located within Medivh's tower. Because Medivh has played such a central role in Warcraft lore, Blizzard is convinced that longtime players will be especially interested in seeing what Karazhan contains. As for battlegrounds, Blizzard has released very little information. However, they have announced plans to make some of the battles from the past accessible through the Caverns of Time.Blood Elves: The New RaceThousands of years ago, the exiled Highborne landed on the shores of Lordaeron and founded the enchanted kingdom of Quel'Thas. These high elves, as they called themselves, created a fountain of vast, magical energies within the heart of their land -- the Sunwell. Over time, they grew dependant on the Sunwell's unstable energies, regardless of the bitter lessons they'd learned in ages past.During the Third War, the villainous Prince Arthas invaded Quel'Thalas and reduced the once-mighty realm to rubble and ashes. His undead army decimated nearly all of the high elven population. In addition, he used the Sunwell's energies to resurrect a powerful undead Lich, Kel'thuzad, thereby fouling the Sunwell's mystical waters. The few elven survivors, realizing that they had been cut off from the source of their arcane power, grew increasingly volatile and desperate.In the midst of the elves' darkest hour came Kael'thas Sunstrider, the last of Quel'Thalas' royal bloodline. Kael, as he was commonly known, knew that the remnant of his people would not long survive without the nourishing magic that once empowered them. Renaming his people \"blood elves\" in honor of their fallen countrymen, Kael taught the survivors how to tap into ambient mystical energies -- even demonic energies -- in order to sate their terrible thirst for magic. In search of a new destiny for his people, Kael'thas ventured to the remote world of Outland where he encountered the fallen night elf, Illidan. Under Illidan's watchful eye, Kael and his blood elves regained much of their former power.Unfortunately, the blood elves practice of embracing demonic energies caused their former comrades in the Alliance to shun them. Thus, the remaining blood elves on Azeroth look desperately to the Horde to help them reach Outland where they can reunite with Kael'thas and achieve the golden destiny he has promised them.Outland: The New ContinentOnce the beautiful homeworld of the orcs, all that remains of Draenor is the scattered wastes of Outland. Following the Second War, the Alliance invaded Draenor by crossing through the Dark Portal. To their horror, they discovered that Ner'zhul -- the dark warlord of Horde -- had constructed a series of new gateways that could lead the beaten Horde to newer, unspoiled worlds. As the Alliance forces closed in around him, Ner'zhul opened his gateways as a means of escape. However, his plan backfired and the gateway's clashing energies resulted in a massive catastrophic explosion that ultimately ripped the world of Draenor to pieces.Nearly thirteen years later -- towards the end of the Third War -- the fallen night elf, Illidan, discovered that huge chunks of Draenor still existed, floating upon the astral winds of the Twisting Nether. After his defeat at the hands of the evil Prince Arthas, Illidan fled to the remnants of Draenor and dubbed them \"Outland.\" He quickly seized control of the chaotic region and sealed the last of Ner'zhul's gateways.Though he is the undisputed ruler of the ravaged land, Illidan lives in fear that he will be discovered by his powerful enemies -- most notably Arthas, the new Lich King, and the remaining Lords of the Burning Legion. For now, Outland is home to a number of scattered draenei tribes, primitive orcs, and powerful, arcane creatures of the Nether itself. Agents of the Burning Legion have also targeted the region as a vital strategic location in their unending Burning Crusade to scour all life from the universe.What else can expected? Blizzard has tantalized Warcraft players with the brief glimpse intoThe Burning Crusade'sstoryline. Will these heroes find friends or foes? What dangers and rewards lie in wait beyond the Dark Portal? And what will they do when they discover that the demons they thought were vanquished have returned to renew their terrible Burning Crusade? These and other questions will remain unanswered until the gameplay can be explored by role-playing Warcrafters.System RequirementsMinimumRecommendedOperating SystemPC: Microsoft Windows XP or Windows Vista (with latest Service Packs)Mac: Mac OS X 10.4.11 or newerCPUPC: Intel Pentium 4 1.3 GHz or AMD Athlong XP 1500+Mac: PowerPC G5 1.6 GHz or Intel Core Duo processorPC: Dual-core processor, such as Intel Pentium D or AmD Athlong 64 X2Mac: Intel 1.8 GHz processor or betterGraphics HardwarePC: 3D graphics processor with Hardware Transfor and Lighting with 32 MB VRAM, such as an ATI Radeon 7200 or NVIDIA GeForce2 class card or betterMac: 3D graphics processor with Hardware Transform and Lighting with 64 MB VRAM, such as ATI Radeon 9600 or NVIDIA GeForce Ti 4600 class card or betterPC: 3D Graphics processor with Vertex and Pixel Shader capabilities with 128 MB VRAM, such as an ATI Radeon X1600 or NVIDIA GeForce 7600 GT class card or betterMac: 3D graphics processor with Vertex and Pixel Shader capability with 128 MB VRAM, such as ATI Radeon X1600 or NVIDIA 7600 class card or better.MemoryPC: 512 MB (1 GB for Vista)Mac: 1 GBPC: 1 GB (2 GB for Vista)Mac: 2 GBHard Drive Space15 GB of free spaceAll Platform RequirementsKeyboard and mouse, required for controls.

The second and more terrible is that his beloved Beatrice has been murdered, and her soul pulled down into hell by a dark force. Vowing not to accept the damnation of either souls, he gives chase, vows to get Beatrice back and descends into the infamous nine circles of hell.

I&rsquo;ve not read a novel wherein medicine, the practice of it, is made as   germane to the storytelling process, to the overall narrative, as the author manages to make it happen here.   The medical detail is stunning, but it never overwhelms the humane and narrative aspects of this moving and   ambitious novel. This is a first-person narration where the first-person voice appears to disappear, but never   entirely; only in the beginning are we aware that the voice addressing us is speaking from the womb! And what   terrific characters--even the most minor players are given a full history. There is also a sense of great   foreboding; by the midpoint of the story, one dreads what will further befall these characters.

Now she rules at his side as Abhorsen, the  sole necromancer of the Old Kingdom, keeping the people safe from the dark power  of Free Magic. But this is not just Sabriel's tale. It is also the story of  Hedge, a mysterious necromancer who is digging up a monstrous evil that could  utterly destroy the Old Kingdom. And it is the story of Prince Sameth,  Touchstone and Sabriel's only son, who would rather fight an entire army of Dead  than disappoint his beloved parents. And Sam's friend Nick, who has unknowingly  loosed Free Magic into the Old Kingdom, blissfully ignorant of its complete  malevolence. But mostly, this is the tale of Lirael, the only daughter of the  future-seeing Clayr who does not possess the Sight. Burying the pain of her  Sightlessness in the Clayr's great library, Third Assistant Librarian Lirael's  insatiable curiosity will soon lead her to an unbelievable destiny that may even  be connected with that of the great Sabriel herself.Garth Nix's stunning sequel toSabriel, full of Mages,  Moggets, and even a Disreputable Dog, is on par with the equally superb works of  Philip Pullman and William Nicholson. And fantasy lovers of all ages will be  thrilled to discover thatLiraelends with more questions than answers,  which will mean a third dip into Nix's beguiling Charter Magic.

If you&#x2019;re new to Kellerman, though, this is not the place to start. Kellerman works primarily in dialogue, with very sketchy narrative support, which requires readers unfamiliar with the backstory to act as their own detectives, figuring out what the heck is going on in each scene. The plot maintains a breakneck pace&#x2014;we move from the Deckers at dinner getting a call from a distressed teen to the teen&#x2019;s revelation that his parents are missing from their hotel to the further revelation that Decker worked on a homicide case 15 years ago in which the now-absent father falsely confessed to murdering his high-school sweetheart, went to jail, and emerged as a hired killer. There goes dinner. Decker and Lazarus have to track down all these moving pieces. Meanwhile, a neonatal nurse with a wild private life is found brutally murdered. Naturally, we have to confront the fact that there may be a serial killer at work. Fans of Joseph Wambaugh will find a very different LAPD here&#x2014;less credible and certainly far less funny&#x2014;than the one he presents. Still, the family-drama side of this series is its main appeal to fans, and that&#x2019;s what will get them through a less-than-stellar effort. --Connie Fletcher",

But this tough gal from  New Jersey, an unemployed discount lingerie buyer, has a much more  interesting story to tell: She has to say that her Miata has been repossessed and  that she's so poor at the moment that she just drank her last bottle of beer  for breakfast. She has to say that her only chance out of her present rut  is her repugnant cousin Vinnie and his bail-bond business. She has to say  that she blackmailed Vinnie into giving her a bail-bond recovery job worth  $10,000 (for a murder suspect), even though she doesn't own a gun and has never apprehended a person in her life. And she has to say that the guy she  has to get, Joe Morelli, is the same creep who charmed away her teenage virginity behind the pastry case in the Trenton bakery where she worked after school.If that hard-luck story doesn't sound compelling enough, Stephanie's several unsuccessful attempts at pulling in Joe make a downright  hilarious and suspenseful tale of murder and deceit. Along the way, several more outlandish (but unrelentingly real) characters join the story,  including Benito Ramirez, a champion boxer who seems to be following Stephanie  Plum wherever she goes.Janet Evanovich shares an authentic feel for the streets of Trenton in  her debut mystery (she developed her talents in a string of romance novels before creating Ms. Plum), and her tough, frank, and funny first-person narrator offers a winning mix of vulgarity and sensitivity. Evanovich  is certainly among the best of the new voices to emerge in the mystery  field of the 1990s.--Patrick O'Kelley",
        "0061779741": "Amazon Exclusive: Christopher Moore on WritingSacre BleuI suppose it started when I learned the circumstances of the suicide of Vincent van Gogh; how he had finished a painting, then walked into a corn field and shot himself, and not in the manner one thinks of a suicide. He shot himself in the abdomen, then walked over a mile on a rough trail through the woods above the village of Auvers, France, to the home of his friend, Doctor Gachet, for help. It seemed clear to me that this was not the behavior of a suicidal man. (Particularly when you see how well he was painting at the time.)  Vincent had been murdered, and for some reason, I guess from looking at his paintings, I thought that the color blue might be a clue to the circumstances of his murder.So I decided to write a novel about the color blue.When it first occurred to me, I had no idea what a can of paint of I was opening. I&rsquo;ve written historical novels before, but I&rsquo;d always picked periods and stories that had huge blank spots in them, spots that I could fill in with my story. But I was about to write about the period in which the French Impressionists rose to prominence, and unlike the life of Jesus or the court of King Lear, where very little was known about what actually happened,  I could pretty much look up what each of the Impressionists had for breakfast every morning.  It was a curse of riches. There was more material than I could ever cover in a single story, unless I found a way to constrain it.So, to pursue my murder mystery, my tale of an art movement,  my portrayal of the Bell Epoch in Paris, I had to find a point of view that would help me cover the time period, from 1863 to 1891 and beyond, so I invented, Lucien Lessard, the baker of Montmartre, Paris&mdash;the baker who wants to be a painter, whose father was a patron of Monet, Renoir, and Cezanne when they were at their poorest, and who attended art school with Vincent van Gogh and his best friend, Henri Toulouse-Lautrec. Lucien and Henri would be my detectives, and with them, we would discover not only Vincent&rsquo;s killer, but the secret and magic behind the mysterious shade of &ldquo;sacred blue&rdquo; (Sacr&eacute; Bleu), and how it had inspired and haunted artists all through history.Four years after the notion first occurred to me, I turned in the manuscript toSacr&eacute; Bleu, and I think it is what I had hoped it could be: a mystery, a fantasy, a romance, a comedy, a history, and an appreciation. I didn&rsquo;t have an art education going into this book, but I certainly do coming out, and I hope that the reader will painlessly and joyfully, share some of the enthusiasm I have for the subject.Or, as it says in the prelude:&ldquo;Blue is glory and power, a wave, a particle, a vibration, a resonance, a spirit, a passion, a memory, a vanity, a metaphor, a dream.Blue is a simile.Blue, she is like a woman.&rdquo;",
        "B0007TFLLC": "The era of no-compromises handheld gaming has arrived. Get ready for immersive, 3D gaming on a console that is poisedto change the way we think about portable devices. With wireless internet, video and digital music playback, and incredible data storage and connectivity options, the Sony PSP--or PlayStation Portable--is a complete solution for the mobile digital lifestyle. Sony has hit the mark by combining both horsepower and groundbreaking features into a package that weighs just a hair more than half a pound.DesignThe PSP's exceptional performance comes from a 333 MHz processor that dwarfs the speed of competing handheld consoles. Add this polygon-pushing muscle to 4 MB of fast DRAM and 32 MB of embedded RAM, and you've got a device with graphics rendering capabilities close to that of the PlayStation2. And because no game is complete without audio, the PSP is generously appointed with built-in stereo speakers, as well Dolby Digital 7.1 surround sound capability. Sony has also pulled out all the stops with the PSP display. The bright, 4.3-inch LCD sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution--plenty of real estate for heavy gaming action and widescreen-format movies. All of this is powered by a removable, and rechargeable, lithium-ion battery.Screen machine: The 4.3-inch display sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution. Movies and games on the go have never been more gorgeous.From a controls perspective, the PSP is made for gaming. If you're familiar with a PlayStation controller, you'll be a pro at the PSP's controls in no time. Directional buttons, as well as an analog stick are provided. Meanwhile, the familiar left and right shoulder buttons, as well as triangle, circle, cross and square buttons are integrated into the device's slim case. Finally, home, select, and start buttons give you quick access and control over the PSP's important functions.To have and to hold: The PSP's easy-to-master controls are cleverly integrated into the device's slim profile.Supported MediaAt the heart of the PSP is a new, proprietary media format known as the Universal Media Disc, or UMD. Each UMD can hold 1.8 GB of data, enough room for rich and complex games. UMDs, which are housed in a protective cover, slide into the rear of the PSP. Sony has declared the UMD an open format for developers and media content owners, so movies, music and other media are on the horizon from third parties. Sony has also signed on many popular game developers for the platform, so a deep library of titles is on tap.While the UMD is great for read-only media such as games and movies, Sony solves the problem of data storage with the addition of a Memory Stick Duo slot. With Memory Stick Duo media, you can store your saved games, downloaded online content, personal video and audio files, and more. When you want access to these files from your PC, simply use the PSP's USB 2.0 port to turn the device into a fast portable media drive. Then, drag and drop files such as your photos, MP3s, and videos onto the PSP, just as you would any other removable storage device. The PSP ships with a 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, and additional media with higher storage capacities are available.Major media: Sony's PSP-compatible Universal Media Disc (UMD) can hold 1.8 GB of data.ConnectivityThe PSP blows away the competition in the connectivity department. Indeed, the PSP's ability to connect to the internet, and to other PSPs and USB-based peripherals, is a real advantage. At the top of the list is Wifi connectivity, or IEEE 801.11b. Use this wireless internet standard to connect to other gamers around the world for hot multiplayer action--all from your couch, or your local Wifi hotspot. As mentioned, the PSP's USB 2.0 port is great for PC connectivity, but it also opens the PSP up for a whole range of future peripherals. Sony has plans for the PSP in other ways, too; the unit's infrared port speaks of remote control capabilities in the near future.A Digital CompanionIf you haven't already guessed, Sony has positioned the PSP to be much more than a gaming device. Out of the box, the device is ready to serve as a portable video player and photo viewer. By using the new H.264 MPEG-4 video standard, Sony obviously has its eyes on making the PSP a robust video device with support for feature length movies and more. In addition, the PSP offers a great way to transport and share your photos in JPEG format. And let's not forget the music. Load up your favorite MP3-encoded songs onto a Memory Stick Duo and you've got a portable audio powerhouse. The device also supports Sony's ATRAC audio codec, so you can play songs acquired from Sony's Connect Online Music Store. Sony even ships a nifty pair of earbuds--complete with an inline remote control-- with the PSP.What's in the BoxPSP device, AC adapter, battery pack, 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, earbud headphones with remote control, soft case and hand strap.",

In addition, the sandbox just got larger with a totally transformed and expanded city of Stilwater, offering all new locations to explore with new vehicles, including motorcycles, boats, helicopters and planes.Saints Row 2will be playable online in 2-player co-op through the entire singleplayer campaign or in the all new open-world competitive multiplayer mode never before seen in the genre.Take back the streets of StilwaterWelcome back to StilwaterView larger.One of the new faces on the Row.View larger.Customization down to the taunt.View larger.Extreme posse creation.View larger.Take the battle to the air.View larger.Weapons that go bang.View larger.Throw down some skin.View larger.BackstoryFive years have passed since your former Saints crew betrayed you. As you awake from a coma for the first time since that fateful day, you find the Stilwater you once ruled is in disarray. Unfamiliar gangs have laid claim to your territory, rival factions have taken over your rackets, and cash-hungry corporations have laid waste to your once proud 3rd Street home. Abandoned and left scarred with an unrecognizable face, you seek out a plastic surgeon to begin your new life on the streets. Yet some things never change in Stilwater.Respect can only be earned and that requires a lifestyle that reflects your unique personality. Your crib, your crew, and your character define who you are on the streets and how you are perceived. The image you portray is as important as the decisions you make in a city ruled by false bravado and impulsive behavior. The only constant is the need for an identity that reflects your individuality. But style and image can only take you so far in a world where actions speak louder than words. Sometimes sending a message to your enemies requires heavy lifting, like that of a rival gang member into oncoming traffic. Respect in Stilwater needs to be taken, and what better way than to grab it from the hands of a gang full of enemies by means of a satchel charge, a flame-thrower or those minigun rounds you've been saving for a special occasion.Meet Your HomiesBut remember that the fight to reclaim Stilwater does not have to be waged alone. The Saints once ruled these streets as a crew of brothers, and their return to the top can help be secured through co-operative alliances. The time has finally come to seek revenge against your rivals to reestablish your crew as the rightful kings of Stilwater, but the streets are crawling with bangers. Check out the crews you'll run into and remember their faces and their ways:3rd Street SaintsOnce the kings of the city, the Saints have been forced out of their titular home of Saints Row by the Ultor Corporation, a giant conglomerate that gentrified the once poor neighborhood. Now operating out of an abandoned underground hotel, the Saints are looking to reclaim the glory that they lost several years ago.RoninOne of the newest gangs instilling fear in Stilwater, the Ronin recruit from both the city's Asian population as well as among the immigrants. Their crimes involve peddling vice through gambling, prostitution, street-racing, and protection rackets, and their power has reached even into the boardroom of corporations like Ultor.Sons of SamediInfluenced by Voodoo and a history of military corruption in Haiti, the Sons of Samedi are known for their potent combination of spiritualism and fearlessness. Members are attracted to the gang out of respect for their methods, through coercion or a desire for easy income generated through trade in their designer drug called \"Loa Dust.\"BrotherhoodFormed from the cast-outs and dredges of Stilwater society, the Brotherhood is a solid force of strength and intimidation intent on revenging itself upon the police and city. Specializing in violent extortion, they forego subtlety and nuance and simply take what they want, all the while flashing their allegiance with piercings and tattoos, bright colors, and gas-guzzling trucks.Ultor CorporationA ruthless corporate contender, the Ultor Corporation's gentrification of Saints Row created a new skyline for the city and a headquarters for their corporate office at the expense of the poor and the 3rd Street Saints. Now they're targeting another neighborhood, the Shivington projects, fueling gang wars and waiting for the prime moment to move in and reap the profits.Key Game Features:Freedom to Explore Through Open World Gameplay- Balancing story progression with all the time-wasting mayhem imaginable,Saints Row 2contains more activities, diversions, races, cribs, city districts, and interiors than ever before.Extensive Mission Play- Over 40 story missions with additional bonus missions take place in a transformed Stilwater that is over 50% larger than before.Limitless Customization-Saints Row 2allows you to customize everything connected to what you wear, drive and where you live as well as gives you access to countless character combinations from facial expression, body type, voice, taunts, gender to walking style. In addition, players can customize gangs various and extreme physical looks (some pretty crazy), fighting styles, gang taunts and tags and vehicle preferences.Improved Combat Functionality- In addition to the usual run, jump, punch, drive, stab, shoot model of combat,Saints Row 2allows you to take human shields and exact finishing moves if you choose, but beware. How you commit crimes affects your notoriety, which determines the response of police.Expanded Multiplayer options- Along with a compelling singleplayer mode, enjoy a variety of multiplayer play options including:Strong Arm: A team-based multiplayer mode batching together prominent activities from the singleplayer campaign into one series of timed events, with the goal to earn the most cash as a team at the end of the events.Gangsta Brawl: A standard deathmatch mode with the single player with the most kills winning.Team Gangsta Brawl: A standard team deathmatch mode with the team with the most kills winning.Co-Op Mode: Full drop in/drop out coop support and ability to play through the full single player campaign with buddies and with the ability to set online co-op games to public, friends-only or invite-only status.Lots of Wieldable Weapons- Whether you talking chairs, parking meters, street signs, newspaper dispensers or your neighbor's garden gnome, use whatever is on hand to take out an enemy.An Explosive Weapon Arsenal- When a melee weapon just won't do, send a message to your enemies by dipping into an arsenal that includes: rocket launchers, shock-paddles, stun-guns, satchel-charges, mini-guns, uzis, automatic shotguns and flame-throwers; Some of which can be duel wielded.A Vehicle for Every Surface- Put the pedal to the metal in a large selection of cars, motorcycles, ATVs, planes, watercraft and helicopters.All New Music-Saints Row 2will feature an entirely new soundtrack of songs and the ability to create a custom in-game radio station, accessible from any vehicle by building a playlist of songs purchased in-game, with in-game money.The Silwater sprawled before you as you wake inSaints Row 2is both familiar and strange, but you will find that the explosive conclusion to the originalSaints Rownot only has left you wounded and betrayed, but also thirsty for revenge.

It should kill Conn, but it doesn't. Nevery, the wizard, has just returned after a 22-year exile, to try to save the town from the leaching of its magic, upon which so much, including its economy, depends. Curious about the boy, Nevery takes him on as an assistant and then an apprentice. Although it is the wizard's job to stem the tide of the disappearing magic, he seems unable to do so. Conn believes he knows the answer, but his enemies are closing in. Prineas has created an appealing cast of characters, which she carefully reveals through their actions. The story is told primarily by Conn, and is interspersed with cryptic journal entries by Nevery, which offer a tantalizing counterpoint to the protagonist's viewpoint.

        "0062202529": "This debut effort from Smith, a war correspondent turned surfing journalist with a cruel, sometimes witty eye, is a mix of reportage and gonzo journalism for the surfing set. Mixing shameless, fey bluster that he dubs Trash Prose and occasionally trenchant observation, Smith delves into the scene surrounding the big-money surfing contests on Oahu, Hawaii's legendary North Shore. As the pro circuit arrives for the winter wave season, Smith sketches an expos&eacute; of the tensions between local Hawaiian surfers and low-level gangsters and the established surfing professionals, surfwear brand representatives, and out-of-towners during this seasonal demographic change. Smith's favorite subject, however, is himself: he sees himself as an outlaw raconteur whose articles garner so much resentment he gets roughed up at a party. He also provides endless descriptions of his wardrobe&mdash;he calls his style his version of Island Dandy, which is purposefully at odds with everything Oahu's North Shore stands for. If Hunter S. Thompson circa Hell's Angels merged with a fashion critic to write about surfing for Maxim, the result might be similar. Smith's approach is myopic, writing for an audience that already knows the sport and the names. There are some astute observations (particularly his analysis of why surfing is essentially a lonely sport), but ultimately the book fails to reveal much beyond the author's considerable self-regard.

All too conscious of the state of his 44-year-old knees after a working life standing at restaurant stoves, but with the unlooked-for jackpot ofKitchen Confidentialas collateral, Mr. Bourdain evidently concluded he needed a bit more wind under his wings.The idea of \"perfect meal\" in this context is to be taken to mean not necessarily the most upscale, chi-chi, three-star dining experience, but the ideal combination of food, atmosphere, and company. This would take in fishing villages in Vietnam, bars in Cambodia, and Tuareg camps in Morocco (roasted sheep's testicle, as it happens); it would stretch to smoked fish and sauna in the frozen Russian countryside and the French Laundry in California's Napa Valley.

The truth is more brutal. More likely, writes Anthony Bourdain inKitchen Confidential, that elegant three-star concoction is the collaborative effort of a team of \"wacked-out moral degenerates, dope fiends, refugees, a thuggish assortment of drunks, sneak thieves, sluts, and psychopaths,\" in all likelihood pierced or tattooed and incapable of uttering a sentence without an expletive or a foreign phrase.

He is obscenely eloquent, unapologetically opinionated, and a damn fine storyteller--a Jack Kerouac of the kitchen.

At the start of L&auml;ckberg's haunting U.S. debut, the first of her seven novels set in the Swedish coastal town of Fj&auml;llbacka, biographer Erica Falck returns home to sort through her deceased parents' belongings and work on her next book. But this is not the same hometown she grew up in. Summer tourists are turning the former fishing village into a thriving resort, and Erica's controlling brother-in-law is pressuring her to cash in by selling the family home. The apparent suicide of childhood friend Alexandra Wijkner contributes to Erica's grief. Once inseparable, they drifted apart before Alex's family abruptly moved away, and Erica feels compelled to write a novel about why the beautiful Alex would kill herself. L&auml;ckberg skillfully details how horrific secrets are never completely buried and how silence can kill the soul. A parallel between the town's downward spiral and the fate of one of Fj&auml;llbacka's wealthiest families adds texture.(June)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0062049690": "Amazon Exclusive: A TALE OF PROVENCE: The story behindThe LanternI&rsquo;ve been having a love affair with Provence for more than 25 years. The light, the views, the colors, the heat&mdash;I find them all intoxicating. I went for the first time with the college boyfriend who would become my husband; his family had had a house in the Luberon for some twenty years. We finally bought our own property in France five years ago after my husband decided to give up banking and realize his long-held ambition to compose music.&ldquo;Les Gen&eacute;vriers&rdquo; (not the property&rsquo;s real name) is described inThe Lanternmore or less as we found it. Its setting is as accurate as I can make it without giving away its precise location. The Luberon area is one of the most sought-after locations in Provence, known for its hilltop villages, lavender, abundant fruit and clear bright light. It is the area Peter Mayle famously chronicled inA Year in Provence.In addition to the abandoned farming hamlet, the story has its roots in the lavender fields and perfume industry in the region. There are small lavender fields and tiny family-run lavender distilleries all around where we live, but the main centers are to the north in Sault and, as described in the novel, to the east at Manosque and the Valensole plateau.The idea of a blind perfumer came from the realization that there were strips of Braille on the packaging used by beauty product brand L&rsquo;Occitane en Provence, based at Manosque. In 1997 the company created the foundation Provence dans tous les Sens (All the Senses of Provence) to introduce visually-impaired children to the world of perfume creation. In the novel, Marthe Lincel finds her true talent as a perfume &ldquo;nose&rdquo; after a visit to the Distillerie Musset from the school for the blind she attends in Manosque, although this episode takes place in the 1930s.For most of the 20th century in this region, there was a gradual erosion of traditional farming as young people moved to the towns to seek work in the new industries and factories. The struggle was intense for those left behind on the hill farms in a region that was poor until the advent of mass tourism. InThe Lantern, as Pierre--the only brother--takes off for better-paid work, and Marthe finds increasing success in Paris, this is the struggle faced by B&eacute;n&eacute;dicte at &ldquo;Les Gen&eacute;vriers&rdquo;&mdash;and the past which gradually comes to disquiet Eve, the heroine of the contemporary narrative strand of the novel.Like Eve, I am an avid reader and worryingly prone to over-imagination. While at the house our first summer, camping on stone floors, I re-read Daphne du Maurier&rsquo;sRebecca, and was as captivated by it as ever--but my thoughts wandered... what if I had come to this place knowing less about the area, or perhaps, less about the man I was with?--Deborah LawrensonA Look InsideThe LanternClick on the images below to open larger versions.Lavender field in sunlightGarden door to the walnut wine cellarView from Gordes to the Luberon ridgeA room with a viewSide door into the alleyway",

        "B00004S99R": "To say thatShenmueis an anticipated title is an understatement;  the game made huge waves in Japan upon its release, and American gamers have  been waiting since then to see what the fuss is all about. It's a game in which  the concept itself is the selling point. What if you could portray a young hero  in a fully realized Japanese city? Would you like to participate in and  influence an over-the-top kung fu-style action-mystery flick in your living  room? What if lots of combat, cinematic flourish, detail, and a dash of romance  were thrown in?The game itself is awash in small details, crammed into a confined space. The  city of Yokusuka circa 1986 is rendered beautifully in a short series of  neighborhoods that are long on detail even if short on variety. The story itself  is ripped straight from a chopsocky flick: you portray the young hero Ryo  Hazuki, whose father (a kung fusensei, naturally) is killed before his  very eyes by a mysterious and frightening villain. Ryo must uncover the identity  of the killer and fight his way through the city in an effort to avenge this  wrongful death.Shenmue's Yokusuka might be short on space--in total, it represents maybe  a square mile--but the detail is overwhelming. You can interact with nearly  every person or object that you see; 300 citizens go about their daily routines,  and whom you encounter is as much determined by where you are as when you are  there.Much of this interaction involves combat that ranges fromDragon's Lair-style reaction tests (such as timing a button press to  dodge an oncoming car) to freeform kung fu fighting. Further, each second of  real time equals about a minute of game time, and Ryo has to be home by 11 p.m.  each evening. The game moves at a brisk pace, and each challenge or battle feels  like a race against time. Some might say that gaming doesn't get shallower than  this (you are essentially performing tasks and exploring, instead of gaming),  but the game feels like no other and is ultimately satisfying by the time that  it all ends. In this way,Shenmueis more than a game--it's an event  that's worth experiencing.--Andrew S.

        "0060852550": "Starred Review.[Signature]Reviewed byNina PlanckMichael Pollan is the crack investigator and graceful narrator of the ecology of local food and the toxic logic of industrial agriculture. Now he has a peer. Novelist Kingsolver recounts a year spent eating home-grown food and, if not that, local. Accomplished gardeners, the Kingsolver clan grow a large garden in southern Appalachia and spend summers \"putting food by,\" as the classic kitchen title goes. They make pickles, chutney and mozzarella; they jar tomatoes, braid garlic and stuff turkey sausage. Nine-year-old Lily runs a heritage poultry business, selling eggs and meat. What they don't raise (lamb, beef, apples) comes from local farms. Come winter, they feast on root crops and canned goods, menus slouching toward asparagus. Along the way, the Kingsolver family, having given up industrial meat years before, abandons its vegetarian ways and discovers the pleasures of conscientious carnivory.This field&mdash;local food and sustainable agriculture&mdash;is crowded with books in increasingly predictable flavors: the earnest manual, diary of an epicure, the environmental battle cry, the accidental gardener.Animal, Vegetable, Miracleis all of these, and much smarter. Kingsolver takes the genre to a new literary level; a well-paced narrative and the apparent ease of the beautiful prose makes the pages fly. Her tale is both classy and disarming, substantive and entertaining, earnest and funny. Kingsolver is a moralist (\"the conspicuous consumption of limited resources has yet to be accepted widely as a spiritual error, or even bad manners\"), but more often wry than pious. Another hazard of the genre is snobbery. You won't find it here. Seldom do paeans to heirloom tomatoes (which I grew up selling at farmers' markets) include equal respect for outstanding modern hybrids like Early Girl.Kingsolver has the ear of a journalist and the accuracy of a naturalist. She makes short, neat work of complex topics: what's risky about the vegan diet, why animals belong on ecologically sound farms, why bitterness in lettuce is good. Kingsolver's clue to help greenhorns remember what's in season is the best I've seen. You trace the harvest by botanical development, from buds to fruits to roots. Kingsolver is not the first to note our national \"eating disorder\" and the injuries industrial agriculture wreaks, yet this practical vision of how we might eat instead is as fresh as just-picked sweet corn. The narrative is peppered with useful sidebars on industrial agriculture and ecology (by husband Steven Hopp) and recipes (by daughter Camille), as if to show that local food&mdash;in the growing, buying, cooking, eating and the telling&mdash;demands teamwork.(May)Nina Planck is the author ofReal Food: What to Eat and Why(Bloomsbury USA, 2006).Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0062030310": "Madeleine Albright on WritingPrague WinterOn the evening of February 4, 1997, I led the cabinet into the House of Representatives prior to the President&rsquo;s annual address&mdash;the first woman ever to do so.  Exchanging greetings with senators and other dignitaries, my heart should have been joyful; instead, I was stunned.  That morning&rsquo;sWashington Postheadline had read: &ldquo;Albright Family Tragedy Comes to Light.&rdquo;I was 59 when I learned from a reporter and from certain letters I had received that my ancestral heritage was Jewish and that more than two dozen of my relatives had died in the Holocaust.  The revelation shook my deeply ingrained sense of identity, and prompted me to seek answers to questions that I had never before thought to ask.  That search began with visits to the small towns in Czechoslovakia where my parents had grown up and to the ancient synagogue where the names of Holocaust victims are enshrined.Prague Winteris a continuation of that personal journey, but also a much wider tale concerning a generation compelled to make painful moral choices amid the tumult of war.In 1939, when efforts by British and French leaders to appease Hitler had backfired, the Nazis invaded my homeland.  I was not yet two years old.  My parents escaped with me to London where my father became head of broadcasting for the Czechoslovak government in exile.  Strangers in an embattled land, we endured along with our new neighbors the terrible bombing of the Blitz.  Back home, the German occupation quickly evolved into a reign of terror under the direction of Reinhard Heydrich, &ldquo;The Butcher of Prague.&rdquo;  As preparations were made to exterminate the country&rsquo;s Jews, Czechoslovak parachutists returned to their native soil with a mission: to kill Heydrich -- the only successful assassination of a senior Nazi during the war.  In the months that followed that daring assault, Czechs suffered from Hitler&rsquo;s vengeance, while Jews confined to the infamous Terezin ghetto struggled to retain hope despite overcrowded conditions and the periodic departure of fellow inmates on trains to the east.  In England, Czechoslovak leaders maneuvered to reclaim their country&rsquo;s independence; my mother and father agonized over the fate of loved ones who had remained behind.From the day America entered the war, my parents and their friends were confident the Allies would win. As democrats from Central Europe, they prayed that the United States&mdash;not the Soviet Union&mdash;would wield the decisive postwar influence in our region. It was not to be. When at last the Nazis were defeated, Czechoslovakia became again a battleground between democracy and totalitarianism; before long, my family was forced into exile for the second time, finding a permanent home in America.The story ofPrague Winteris often as intensely personal as a mother&rsquo;s letter, a father&rsquo;s hidden sorrow, and the earnest artwork of an imprisoned ten-year-old cousin.  The themes, however, are universal: loyalty and betrayal, respect and bigotry, accommodating evil or fighting back.  What fascinates me is why we make the choices we do. What prompts one person to act boldly in a moment of crisis and a second to seek shelter in the crowd? Why do some people become stronger in the face of adversity while others quickly lose heart?  What drives many of us to look down on neighbors based on the flimsy pretexts of nationality and creed?  Is it education, spiritual belief, parental guidance, traumatic events, or more likely some combination that causes us to follow the paths that we do?  My search for answers compelled me to look back&mdash;to the time of harshest winter in the city of my birth.",

        "0099287595": "\"Every summer Lin Kong returned to Goose Village to divorce his wife, Shuyu.\" Like a fairy tale, Ha Jin's masterful novel of love and politics begins with a formula--and like a fairy tale,Waitinguses its slight, deceptively simple framework to encompass a wide range of truths about the human heart. Lin Kong is a Chinese army doctor trapped in an arranged marriage that embarrasses and repels him. (Shuyu has country ways, a withered face, and most humiliating of all, bound feet.) Nevertheless, he's content with his tidy military life, at least until he falls in love with Manna, a nurse at his hospital.  Regulations forbid an army officer to divorce without his wife's consent--until 18 years have passed, that is, after which he is free to marry again. So, year after year Lin asks his wife for his freedom, and year after year he returns from the provincial courthouse: still married, still unable to consummate his relationship with Manna. Nothing feeds love like obstacles placed in its way--right? But Jin's novel answers the question of what might have happened to Romeo and Juliet had their romance been stretched out for several decades. In the initial confusion of his chaste love affair, Lin longs for the peace and quiet of his \"old rut.\" Then killing time becomes its own kind of rut, and in the end, he is forced to conclude that he \"waited eighteen years just for the sake of waiting.\"There's a political allegory here, of course, but it grows naturally from these characters' hearts. Neither Lin nor Manna is especially ideological, and the tumultuous events occurring around them go mostly unnoticed. They meet during a forced military march, and have their first tender moment during an opera about a naval battle. (While the audience shouts, \"Down with Japanese Imperialism!\" the couple holds hands and gazes dreamily into each other's eyes.) When Lin is in Goose Village one summer, a mutual acquaintance rapes Manna; years later, the rapist appears on a TV report titled \"To Get Rich Is Glorious,\" after having made thousands in construction. Jin resists hammering ideological ironies like these home, but totalitarianism's effects on Lin are clear:Let me tell you what really happened, the voice said. All those years you waited torpidly, like a sleepwalker, pulled and pushed about by others' opinions, by external pressure, by your illusions, by the official rules you internalized. You were misled by your own frustration and passivity, believing that what you were not allowed to have was what your heart was destined to embrace.Ha Jin himself served in the People's Liberation Army, and in fact left his native country for the U.S. only in 1985. That a non-native speaker can produce English of such translucence and power is truly remarkable--but really, his prose is the least of the miracles here. Improbably, Jin makes an unconsummated 18-year love affair loom as urgent as political terror or war, while history-changing events gain the immediacy of a domestic dilemma. Gracefully phrased, impeccably paced,Waitingis the kind of realist novel you thought was no longer being written.--Mary Park--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

Rachel enjoys cocaine, alcohol and meeting men in bars, especially men wearing tight leather pants. She can match anybody's hilarious anecdotes about a Catholic childhood, but recently her life's gone awry, and God has become \"more like a celestial stand-up comic\" than a \"benign old guy with long hair.\" When she wakes up in a hospital emergency room and finds she's been diagnosed as a suicidal drug addict, she's enraged. She's also broke and unemployed, and her boyfriend has abandoned her. As a final indignity, her father takes her back home and books her into Dublin's Betty Ford-like clinic, the Cloisters. Famous for a clientele of rock stars, it should be a glamorous spa, but it isn't. Quarters are spartan, clients do housework and group therapy is humiliating. It could be worse, though, and there's one good-looking fellow-inmate who might, or might not, be a lifeline post-Cloisters. This novel isn't a how-to on overcoming addiction but an examination, often comic, of treatment that is expected to result in personality changes necessary for recovery. Smart-ass Rachel actually becomes a beguiling heroine after learning to wake up and cook eggs at about the same time in the morning she used to fall into somebody's bed in New York. Clever badinage (\"the only way to get over one man is get under another\") unfortunately sometimes gives way to phrases like \"pantie-meltingly gorgeous.\" The narrative is overlong, and the characters rarely speakAthey yell or shriekAbut, overall, Keyes's stylish wit keeps readers attentive, and her take on addiction is insightful and compassionate.

        "006113922X": "This dizzying road movie of a first novel follows a passel of comic con men (and one con woman) down and around the Florida coast. Their adventures involve deliciously caricatured characters along with delirious violence, not to mention pigeon-eating maniacs, cocaine, traffic jams, biker gangs, hot-tub accidents, mock-Satanic heavy metal bands, partially frozen crocodilians, the World Series and the space shuttle. Serge and Coleman are roommates, manic ne'er-do-wells trying to fashion a living from crime and adventure. Sexy Sharon Rhodes murders magnates for their life insurance. On the run after her last hit, she meets Serge and Coleman, and the trio start a crime spree. Former millionaire George Veale has just been released from prison when he absconds with a suitcase of drug money. The cash belongs to insurance CEO Charles Saffron, who hires sleazy private investigator Mo Grenadine to get it back. (Mo is also a corrupt right-wing state legislator and a gay-baiting talk radio host.) Serge and Coleman (themselves remotely connected to drug cartels) get wind of the suitcase and scheme for the cash. Sharon wants in on the caper, too, whether or not the two men planned it that way. Dorsey's cast of dangerous oddballs chase, rob, shoot and kill their way from Tampa to the Florida Keys and the Dry Tortugas, until their raucous evasion of law catches up with them. Dorsey is a newspaperman by trade (at the Tampa Tribune), and his sentence rhythm can be crisply journalistic: \"Wilbur Putzenfus was losing hair on top and working the comb-over. No tan. No tone.... Spiro Agnew without the power.\" Floridian readers may laugh or wince as Dorsey skewers the state's foibles and stereotypes. But he can abandon his verbal dexterity and his social observation to get a quick laugh or a quick jolt of violence: as a result, his satire seems less serious than it might be. Admirers of Elmore Leonard and Carl Hiassen will note their influences here; as entertainment, this rollicking, over-the-top novel is a blast. Agent, Nat Sobel.

        "0099472252": "Alice Munro has been accused of telling the same story over and over, and to a certain extent the characterization is true. Her subject matter is inevitably the vagaries of love between middle-aged people in some rural Canadian setting, trapped there by the combination of their desires and weaknesses. Or, if not love, then at least the mysteries of relationships as characters struggle to understand each other and themselves. But this thematic single-mindedness can hardly be considered a criticism considering Munro tells stories better than anybody else and with a level of precision matched by few. It would be like criticizing Shakespeare for writing about politics.Runawayis no exception. The stories take place throughout Canada--northern Ontario, the Prairies, the West Coast, Stratford--and feature women and men drifting in and out of each other's orbits, pulled by forces they don't understand. In \"Runaway,\" a woman considers leaving her husband with the help of a neighbor, but the husband has other plans. In \"Chance,\" a woman leaves her life behind in a quest for a man she met on a train crossing the country. Their intertwined lives play out through two more stories, \"Soon\" and \"Silence,\" but the path they follow is as unpredictable to the reader as it is to them. In \"Trespasses,\" a small town's women dream of escaping their lives only to find themselves in lives they never imagined.What really marks the stories is Munro's sense of mood. There's a sense of hidden menace or even violence everywhere inRunaway. It occasionally erupts, but always in surprising and unexpected ways, and with unintended consequences. Munro may be an old-fashioned storyteller, but she understands chaos theory well enough. The same story? Sure. But it's a damn good one.--Peter Darbyshire, Amazon.ca--This text refers to theHardcoveredition.",
        "B00006I02Z": "In many ways, creating a sequel toHalf-Lifeis an unenviable task.  After all, the goal is to craft not just any ordinary game, but an improvement to a title that is widely considered to be the high water mark for first person shooters.  Fortunately, Valve does not disappoint on their sophomore effort.Half-Life 2picks up exactly where its predecessor leaves off, with gamers stepping once more into Gordon Freeman's HVAC suit as he awakes at some indeterminate time in the future, now apparently in the employ of the mysterious G-Man.  Humanity has been sold out to alien forces, and your job is to escape their thrall and lead the resistance to victory.HL2's key successes are in a few critical areas, the first of which is the new physics & graphics engine, called Source.  People and objects fall, fly, tip over, float, and break in an extraordinarily realistic fashion, and in-game puzzles often require you to use simple applications of physics to progress. Second, an elaborate facial structure system coupled with excellent voice acting make for some of the most believably human NPCs in gaming history.  This is no small thing; you will find yourself actually caring about the characters who surround you, even those that are normally regarded as cannon fodder.  Third, the level design exhibits a subtle brilliance, which frequently fools you into feeling like you're making your way through an organic environment and not a forced linear path.  These elements combine to form one of the most truly immersive experiences ever captured on a PC.This gaming bliss comes at a cost, however.  If your computer isn't running the latest and greatest hardware, you may find yourself turning down a lot of the slick graphics to keep the machine from choking.  Also, at the time of this writing the only two bundled multiplayer games are a barely updated version ofCounter-StrikeandHL2 DeathMatch.Counter-Strike: Sourceis every bit as fun as the original, but the DeathMatch is lackluster and contains only a handful of uninspired maps.Overall,Half-Life 2is a smashing success, every bit worthy of the prestige and respect that the franchise has been awarded.  This is absolutely a game that every computer gaming enthusiast is going to want to have in their collection.-- Jon \"Safety Monkey\" GroverPros:Advanced graphics and physics system provide highly immersive experienceBelievable, expressive non-player charactersFun, realistic level designCons:Requires a very fast computer to play with all bells & whistles onDeathMatch mode has few maps and is not terribly entertaining",
        "0062041282": "Starred Review. Dewitt's bang-up second novel (after Ablutions) is a quirky and stylish revisionist western. When a frontier baron known as the Commodore orders Charlie and Eli Sisters, his hired gunslingers, to track down and kill a prospector named Herman Kermit Warm, the brothers journey from Oregon to San Francisco, and eventually to Warm's claim in the Sierra foothills, running into a witch, a bear, a dead Indian, a parlor of drunken floozies, and a gang of murderous fur trappers. Eli's deadpan narration is at times strangely funny (as when he discovers dental hygiene, thanks to a frontier dentist dispensing free samples of \"tooth powder that produced a minty foam\") but maintains the power to stir heartbreak, as with Eli's infatuation with a consumptive hotel bookkeeper. As more of the brothers' story is teased out, Charlie and Eli explore the human implications of many of the clich&eacute;s of the old west and come off looking less and less like killers and more like traumatized young men. With nods to Charles Portis and Frank Norris, DeWitt has produced a genre-bending frontier saga that is exciting, funny, and, perhaps unexpectedly, moving. (May)(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

Although the Arkham asylum is well fortified, he has a nagging feeling that all is not well, which proves to be the case when seconds after turning The Joker over to the guards, the master criminal breaks free of his captors. Even more surprising than this quick turn of events is the revelation that it was never The Joker's intent to escape the vault-like facility, but instead to trap Batman there. Surrounded by an asylum full of dangerous criminals, many of which he put there and all at the beck and call of the Joker, can Batman survive and discover what is behind the Joker's intricate plot?GameplayInBatman: Arkham Asylumplayers strap on the gadget-heavy utility belt of the Caped Crusader. Gameplay here is a combination of both the knuckle crunching rush of hand to hand combat as you take on the hordes of thugs that infest Arkham Asylum, and stealth gameplay in which you must dispatch individuals from the shadows. Players can expect an engrossing single player campaign in which Batman continually moves forward to face the henchmen, bosses and traps that The Joker has set for him. With regards to opponents, in addition to The Joker who you will hear more than you see, the dark walls of Arkham also hold familiar villains from the the Batman criminal universe including Harley Quinn, Victor Zsasz and Killer Croc, that you will have to deal with, but don't expect a one-dimensional experience. As players progress from environment to environment within Arkham they will have to use varying combinations of muscle, detective skills, gadgetry and a certain degree of light RPG-like leveling of Batman's skills, arsenal and physical characteristics to survive and discover what The Joker's underlying scheme is.In addition to the story-driven single player campaignArkham Asylumalso contains various additional play modes. These include an arcade styled combat mode where players accumulate points by engaging hordes of thugs in a hand to hand slugfest across a series of maps, in which Batman's physical strength and agility play a major role. The key here is to chain together as many attacks as possible due to the fact that with each successful combo players increase the point multiplier associated with their actions. The game also features a time-based stealth mode where players must hone their ability to strike silently from the shadows. This gameplay, referred to as 'Invisible Predator' utilizes the Dark Knight's skill with gadgets like the grapple tool, batarang and explosives. These allow for vertical/horizontal mobility, the ability to quickly strike from above and at a distance and to take out enemies and create distractions, even through walls. But remember that Batman works solo and is not superhuman. Your enemies will congregate around trouble areas and work as a team against you, so you must be silent, plan your attacks wisely, strike quickly and discover the value of encouraging fear within enemies.Key FeaturesUtilize the unique FreeFlow combat system to chain together unlimited combos seamlessly and battle with huge groups of The Joker's henchmen in brutal melee brawls.Investigate as Batman, the world's greatest detective, by solving intricate puzzles with the help of cutting edge forensic tools including x-ray scanning, fingerprint scans, 'Amido Black' spray and a pheromone tracker.Face off against Gotham's greatest villains including The Joker, Harley Quinn, Victor Zsasz and Killer Croc.Become the Invisible Predator with Batman's fear takedowns and unique vantage point system to move without being seen and hunt enemies.Choose multiple takedown methods, including swooping from the sky and smashing through walls, and use the predator camera get a closer look at the action.Explore every inch of Arkham Asylum and roam freely on the infamous island, presented for the first time ever in its gritty and realistic entirety.Experience what it's like to be Batman using batarangs, explosive gel aerosol, the Batclaw, sonar resonator and the line launcher.Unlock more secrets by completing hidden challenges in the world and develop and customize equipment by earning experience points.Enjoy complete superhero freedom in the environment with the use of Batman's grapple to get to any place you can see, jump from any height and glide in any direction.PlayStation 3 exclusive Joker Challenge Map DLC.",

Never insist that a man wash his own dishes, either; both women and men should respect the division of labor and a woman's status as homemaker. Although Schlessinger acknowledges that men have a responsibility to communicate and recommends that they express gratitude to their wives for domestic attentions, she clearly delineates a successful marriage as one between a male financial provider and a female emotional caregiver. She includes a digression on the differences between the sexes and the masculine/feminine polarity. Though this latest guide will confirm Dr. Laura's retrograde views for many, devotees will continue to look to her for answers.(Jan.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "B0002B90SA": "Smug Statement: The Sith Lords is smart, deep, dark, and stands as the best thing to happen to Star Wars since Timothy Zahn penned the extraordinary Heir to the Empire trilogy. Much like a Padawan learning the ways of the Force from a Jedi Master, Obsidian Entertainment has embraced the teachings of BioWare, built upon the original formula, and forged a powerful sequel that will take your breath away faster than Vader ever&#xA0;could.In the five years that have passed since the fall of Lord Malak, the Dark Side of the Force has spread across the galaxy like a disease. Sith Lord attacks have devastated the Old Republic, and the Jedi guardians are on the verge of extinction. The Republic's only hope of survival lies within your uncertain hands. Awakening in a battle-damaged vessel that is spinning uncontrollably through an asteroid field, you have no recollection of your past, yet you can feel the Force flowing through your veins. Will you side with the Republic and battle the Sith scourge? Or will you fade into darkness and let evil reign?This compelling introduction pulls you into the plot, keeping you completely transfixed as you tip the scales between the light and dark and scour the cosmos for clues that will unearth your enigmatic past. The tale is paced to perfection and never once feels like it is making unnecessary detours to lengthen the experience.From HK-47's amusing \"droid prejudice\" banter to Kreia's cryptic messages, the game is overflowing with fascinating personalities and some of the most believable characters to ever be brought to life in a game. Again, pacing is used expertly to develop relationships with the player. As the plot unfolds, you'll be forced to decide who to trust, who to keep close, and who to keep a watchful eye on. When you communicate with your allies, your choice of words will affect your standing with them. If you have a high enough influence over them, they may open up to you and follow your ways (be it light or&#xA0;dark).The game also dives deeper into Star Wars lore as it utilizes a much wider selection of alien species, weapons, and gear, as well as planets that we really haven't seen much of in the movies or games. Obsidian can also be commended for creating not one, but two of the most fearsome and awe-inspiring nemeses in the Star Wars universe. Discovering who these Sith Lords are is another of the games exciting mysteries.On the gameplay front, Obsidian stuck to the formula of the original game, but has built upon it with little additions and subtle tweaks. Of course, this still means that your supporting party will blindly run over a clearly visible mine, load times are just as extensive, some of the loose ends in the plot are not tied up (what's up with the HK droids?), and slowdown occurs when too many characters engage in battle. In short it still has its annoyances, yet the new material more than makes up for them. As you engage in conversation, you can now tap into your skills to add a new level of persuasion. For instance, if your character is knowledgeable to the subject matter, you may be prompted with an awareness option. Another interesting addition is the ability to break down items into components that you can turn around and use to create a wide variety of things.The missions that you'll undertake are just as varied, and the consequences to your actions can be just as cataclysmic. A raised level cap won't stunt your characters growth this time around, and the variety that stems from the new character interactions only heightens the reasons to play this game numerous times. Many of the visuals are a bit underwhelming, but the detail in the facial modeling is much more defined, and you won't see as many unintentional identical twins throughout your&#xA0;journey.It's almost impossible to deny the charms that emerge from this title's expertly crafted story and unbound freedom. The Sith Lords is a crowning accomplishment for video games and one of the finest Star Wars stories ever told.Concept:A Star Wars mystery set in the old times that offers up a fantastic story and role-playing blissGraphics:Better facial models, but the environments are still bland and slowdown does occurSound:The score fits perfectly into Star Wars canon, and the character dialogue is some of the best to datePlayability:The same engine with a few enhancements around the edges. Influencing characters and making items are done wellEntertainment:You absolutely have to play it twice to see where the story goes for light and darkReplay:HighRated:9.25 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:February 20052nd Opinion:The call of The Sith Lords is impossible to resist. Embracing the dark side, I twisted an apprentice to my corrupt will, polluted the Force with senseless slaughter, and was told by my loyal HK unit that I was like \"a delightful random cruelty generator.\" Even more than its predecessor, The Sith Lords provides countless opportunities for players to revel in the aftermath of their own choices. Essentially, anyone who said that Obsidian couldn't live up to the standards set by BioWare's first installment should be stuffing their mouths full of Bantha fodder right about now. Every exemplary aspect of KOTOR has actually been improved through expanded dialogue options, tons of alignment-specific variables, and a more engaging story. Honestly, I want to give this game an even higher score, but I just can't ignore the multitude of technical problems (like pathfinding and battle glitches) and certain key plot point omissions. Regardless, despite the imperfections, The Sith Lords crushes the feeble windpipes of any other RPG of 2004.Rated:9 out of 10Editor:Joe JubaSubscribe to Game Informer",

        "006039384X": "Maguire has a lock on clever, elaborate retellings of fairy tales, turning them inside out and couching them in tongue-in-cheek baroque prose. After his revisionist takes on Oz's Wicked Witch of the West (Wicked) and Cinderella's ugly stepsisters (Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister), he now tackles Snow White. The notorious Borgia habit of poisoning rivals inspired him to transplant the classic tale to 16th-century Tuscany, where Vicente de Nevada is an expatriate Spanish widower who lives with his daughter, the fair Bianca. Beholden to sinister Cesare Borgia and Cesare's sister (and perhaps lover) Lucrezia, Vicente is sent on what appears to be a fool's errand, to discover and steal from a Middle East monastery a branch of the Tree of Knowledge complete with three apples. When Bianca is 11, Cesare's attraction to her causes the envious Lucrezia to order a young hunter to murder her and deliver her heart in a casket. Bianca, of course, is spared and taken in by seven dwarfs. But this is not Disney; the dwarfs are boulders, stirred to life by Bianca's arrival (\"a clothed, bearded obstinacy became slowly apparent\"). Several years pass in surreal, dreamlike fashion, with Bianca tending to the dwarfs, who cavort stiffly and philosophize collectively. When Vicente returns successful, Lucrezia poisons an apple for her rival. Innocent Bianca's fate is gentle, but that of the corrupt Lucrezia, in brilliant Venice, is appropriately grotesque. Fairy tales in their original form are often brutal and disturbing; with his rich, idiosyncratic storytelling, Maguire restores the edge to an oft-told tale and imbues it with a strange, unsettling beauty.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.",

She took acting classes, modeled clothes, sold industry papers in the theater district, ushered at shows, danced at the USO&mdash;anything to get a break. Barely 18 when director Howard Hawks brought her to Hollywood for a screen test, she soon fell in love with Bogart, married and started a family. After Bogart's death a decade later, she rebounded with Sinatra, but tied the knot with Jason Robards before finding her way as a single woman, with friends and work as her passion. Bacall's intimates&mdash;from Katharine Hepburn to Adlai Stevenson&mdash;weren't the standard air-kissing, gossip-column regulars, but people who loved and respected each other for their work and their values. Sadly, like Bogart, they're also of a generation older than Bacall, so there's a lot of dying in these pages. Indeed, this sequel to 1978'sBy Myselfis mostly a discussion of the deaths of some great friends: Roddy McDowall, John Gielgud, Gregory Peck and many more. Bacall does discuss the roles she's played as an older actress, but this work's real theme is the experience of surviving the death of so many wonderful friends. Readers looking for basic Hollywood romance and drama can stick to the first 400 pages; those seeking a more mature portrait can brave the final 100. Either way, Bacall's a class act.

There wasn't a funeral that Maylene didn't attend, and at each Rebekkah watched as Maylene performed the same unusual ritual: three sips from a small silver flask followed by the words \"Sleep well, and stay where I put you.\"Now Maylene is dead and Bek must go back to the place--and the man--she left a decade ago. But what she soon discovers is that Maylene was murdered and that there was good reason for her odd traditions. It turns out that in placid Claysville, the worlds of the living and the dead are dangerously connected. Beneath the town lies a shadowy, lawless land ruled by the enigmatic Charles, aka Mr. D--a place from which the dead will return if their graves are not properly minded. Only the Graveminder, a Barrow woman, and the current Undertaker, Byron, can set things to right once the dead begin to walk.A Q&amp;A with Author Melissa MarrQ:What inspires you as a writer?Marr:Music, travel, and lore.Graveminderbegan in 2007 on a trip to Ireland during which I&rsquo;d read a paragraph or so on the &ldquo;hungry dead.&rdquo;Wicked Lovelysparked from Scottish folklore. The YA novel I just wrote,Carnival of Souls, was a combination of a phrase from a song and an article on demonology.Q:Where did the story inGravemindercome from? Did something in particular spark the characters or the plot?Marr:Once I had the general concept (&ldquo;mind your dead lest they come back hungry&rdquo;), I looked to my own life. I enjoy cemeteries, and I&rsquo;m fascinated by lore/myth of Death. I added a small town, a ghost-town-esque land of the dead, and various other things I like. This is actually the novel closest to my roots in many ways.Q:The characters inGraveminderdiscover they have had a destiny to fulfill since they were born. Can you talk about putting characters into that situation and what it brings out in them?Marr:Between the Wicked Lovely series and this, it&rsquo;s pretty obvious I&rsquo;m fascinated by the idea of fate and choice. I think we are all born with advantages and disadvantages because of so many things beyond our control (family, economics, culture, religion, country, genetic factors). People can be defined by those factors, revise their fate&mdash;or opt for some combination of the two.  That choice is what makes our stories as people unique.Q:How did you go about building the Graveminder mythology? Is it based on any folklore or mythology itself?Marr:Around the world there are all sorts of traditions of ancestor regard and duty to the dead. Some traditions dictate how the dead are taken to the grave to keep them from finding their way back if they wake; some traditions include speaking (or not speaking) of them. There are myriad traditions I&rsquo;d have loved to explore, but the one I used at base is that the dead must be nourished with food, drink, and story for a set time. Failure results in the dead coming back to get a different manifestation of the nourishment they need&mdash;flesh, blood, and breath.Q:InGraveminderthe dead walk among the living and the living can even walk among the dead. What are your thoughts about these two worlds you&rsquo;ve created?Marr:I like liminality, borders and those who exist on and because of the lines. Much of the real world is defined by a series of in/out groupings. We are either a or b; things are good or bad; and everything is pro or con. The reality, I believe, is that there are often gradations&mdash;degrees of right and wrong, measures of beautiful and horrible.

        "0061578916": "Book Description\"The greatest writer of historical adventures today\" (Washington Post) tackles his richest, most thrilling subject yet--the heroic tale of Agincourt.Young Nicholas Hook is dogged by a cursed past--haunted by what he has failed to do and banished for what he has done. A wanted man in England, he is driven to fight as a mercenary archer in France, where he finds two things he can love: his instincts as a fighting man, and a girl in trouble. Together they survive the notorious massacre at Soissons, an event that shocks all Christendom. With no options left, Hook heads home to England, where his capture means certain death. Instead he is discovered by the young King of England--Henry V himself--and by royal command he takes up the longbow again and dons the cross of Saint George. Hook returns to France as part of the superb army Henry leads in his quest to claim the French crown. But after the English campaign suffers devastating early losses, it becomes clear that Hook and his fellow archers are their king's last resort in a desperate fight against an enemy more daunting than they could ever have imagined.One of the most dramatic victories in British history, the battle of Agincourt--immortalized by Shakespeare inHenry V--pitted undermanned and overwhelmed English forces against a French army determined to keep their crown out of Henry's hands. Here Bernard Cornwell resurrects the legend of the battle and the \"band of brothers\" who fought it on October 25, 1415. An epic of redemption,Agincourtfollows a commoner, a king, and a nation's entire army on an improbable mission to test the will of God and reclaim what is rightfully theirs. From the disasters at the siege of Harfleur to the horrors of the field of Agincourt, this exhilarating story of survival and slaughter is at once a brilliant work of history and a triumph of imagination&#8212;Bernard Cornwell at his best.Historical Notes onAgincourtby Bernard CornwellThe battle of Agincourt (Azincourt was and remains the French spelling) was one of the most remarkable events of medieval Europe, a battle whose reputation far outranked its importance. In the long history of Anglo-French rivalry only Hastings, Waterloo, Trafalgar, and Cr&#233;cy share Agincourt&#x2019;s renown. It is arguable that Poitiers was a more significant battle and an even more complete victory, or that Verneuil was just as astonishing a triumph, and it&#x2019;s certain that Hastings, Blenheim, Victoria, Trafalgar, and Waterloo were more influential on the course of history, yet Agincourt still holds its extraordinary place in English legend. Something quite remarkable happened on 25 October 1415 (Agincourt was fought long before Christendom&#x2019;s conversion to the new-style calendar, so the modern anniversary should be on 4 November). It was something so remarkable that its fame persists almost six hundred years later.Agincourt&#x2019;s fame could just be an accident, a quirk of history reinforced by Shakespeare&#x2019;s genius, but the evidence suggests it really was a battle that sent a shock wave through Europe. For years afterward the French called 25 October 1415la malheureuse journ&#233;e(the unfortunate day). Even after they had expelled the English from France they remembered la malheureuse journ&#233;e with sadness. It had been a disaster.Yet it was so nearly a disaster for Henry V and his small, but well-equipped army. That army had sailed from Southampton Water with high hopes, the chief of which was the swift capture of Harfleur, which would be followed by a foray into the French heartland in hope, presumably, of bringing the French to battle. A victory in that battle would demonstrate, at least in the pious Henry&#x2019;s mind, God&#x2019;s support of his claim to the French throne, and might even propel him onto that throne. Such hopes were not vain when his army was intact, but the siege of Harfleur took much longer than expected and Henry&#x2019;s army was almost ruined by dysentery.The tale of the siege in the novel is, by and large, accurate, though I did take one great liberty, which was to sink a mineshaft opposite the Leure Gate. There was no such shaft, the ground would not allow it, and all the real mines were dug by the Duke of Clarence&#x2019;s forces that were assailing the eastern side of Harfleur. The French counter-mines defeated those diggings, but I wanted to give a flavor, however inadequately, of the horrors men faced in fighting beneath the earth. The defense of Harfleur was magnificent, for which much of the praise must go to Raoul de Gaucourt, one of the garrison&#x2019;s leaders. His defiance, and the long days of the siege, gave the French a chance to raise a much larger army than any they might have fielded against Henry if the siege had ended, say, in early September.Maps of the Battlefield (Click to Enlarge)England and France, 1415:One of the most dramatic victories in British history, the battle of Agincourt--immortalized by Shakespeare inHenry V--pitted undermanned and overwhelmed English forces against a French army determined to keep their crown out of Henry's hands.The French Coast:The British campaign, which started at Harfleur, ended more than two months later on 25 October at Agincourt.Harfleur:Henry's army landed in northern France on 13 August 1415 and besieged the port of Harfleur.The Battle Lines:&#x201C;We few, we happy few, we band of brothers; For he today who sheds his blood with me shall be my brother.&#x201D; &#x2013; William Shakespeare,Henry V",

You never saw anyone who  looked less like a princess than I do. I mean, I have really bad hair... and...  a really big mouth and no breasts and feet that look like skis.\" And if this  news wasn't bad enough, Mia's mom has started dating her algebra teacher, the  paparazzi is showing up at school, and she's in a huge fight with her best  friend, Lilly. How much more can this reluctant Cinderella handle?Offbeat Mia will automatically win the heart of every teenage girl who's ever  just wanted to fit in with as little fuss as possible. Debut author Meg Cabot's  writing is silly and entertaining, with tons of pop culture references that will  make teens feel right at home within her pages. This is a wonderfully wacky  read.

Well, one way would be to meet a real spy. But then, of course, they might be a bit hard to spot (that's in the job description, after all). Or better, read an excellent new novel by a former spy, one who has the gifts of a born storyteller.Spycatcheris such a novel. And Matthew Dunn is that very talented new author. I know of no other spy thriller that so successfully blends the fascinating nuances of the business of espionage and intelligence work with full-throttle suspense storytelling.&rdquo; --Jeffery DeaverAmazon Exclusive: Jeffrey Deaver Interviews Matthew DunnJeffrey Deaver:Matthew, why did you choose to write under your own name and not a pseudonym? Isn&rsquo;t that what most people who&rsquo;ve written about espionage work have done? Are there risks to using your own name?Matthew Dunn:When I was a spy I always operated under completely different identities. At the beginning of every mission, I felt like an actor taking to the stage on the first night. Though an actor can take off his or her costume at the end of the night, often I could not do so for months and in some cases years. I decided to write under my own name for three reasons: First, I wanted to do something that had my real name attached to my work. Second, I felt my readers deserved to know who I really am. And third, I felt it would be cowardly to hide behind another name since I am no longer a spy. Yes, there are severe and immediate risks, and I&rsquo;m conscious of them every day. But I&rsquo;ve chosen those risks. If a team comes for me, I&rsquo;ll deal with it.JD:What kind of man or woman makes an ideal field officer&mdash;one who runs agents?MD:There are many quantifiable traits &ndash; intellect, skills in lateral thinking, a gregarious personality (deployed in exact moments), an unwavering belief that anything is possible, the ability to manipulate, ruthlessness, compassion, leadership, the ability to make rifle-shot decisions, and tremendous courage. But ultimately MI6, the CIA, the French DGSE, the Russian SVR (the successor to the KGB) and Mossad &ndash; that is, the truly &ldquo;global&rdquo; intelligence services &ndash; recruit a particular breed of animal to work as an agent, and one knows that animal when one sees her or him.  That person is simply different from everyone else. If you are a good field officer, your agent (i.e. the foreign national you&rsquo;ve recruited to spy on his country) will trust you with his life. He won&rsquo;t risk execution by working for just MI6 or whatever institution you represent &ndash; he&rsquo;ll do it for you.JD:How autonomous does a field officer have to be? And is operating solo an advantage in the world of intelligence and espionage?MD:Intelligence officers are lone wolves. It&rsquo;s vital that they don&rsquo;t make themselves visible.  One can&rsquo;t get the best intelligence by using a sledgehammer approach. To that extent, there are no &ldquo;superior forces or big guns&rdquo; when you&rsquo;re in the field. Your country&rsquo;s army, navy, and air force are the inferior forces that are liable to get it wrong. And that means you can&rsquo;t trust or use them. But if you mess up and get caught, you will die.JD:Can you describe the operation for which you were awarded an unusual, special commendation by the British government?MD:I can, but I won&rsquo;t.JD:Good call. If you had answered, maybeI'dhave found one of those red laser dots on my forehead&hellip; If there's one vital lesson to be learned in foreign intelligence training, what is it?MD:Mind-set is key. An MI6 officer believes that he or she can achieve anything and very often that self-belief is justified. MI6 is far and away the best intelligence organization at encouraging that outlook. As a result, and based on what it has achieved, it is without doubt the best intelligence organization in the world.JD:What do you mean when you say, &ldquo;When a gun comes out on a deep-cover mission, it&rsquo;s the worst thing that can happen?&rdquo; Talk a bit about the physical aspects of espionage.MD:Officers are typically trained to use guns in tight, urban situations, to deploy highly aggressive and effective unarmed military combat techniques, and to do whatever is necessary to get out of a situation. But the primary role of a spy is to collect intelligence. When guns are deployed &ndash; certain direct actions excluded &ndash; something has gone wrong. Even when things have gone wrong, many good spies would prefer to die and maintain the integrity of the operation than to pull a weapon. No good intelligence comes out of a fight or torture; these actions only result in the pleadings of a man who wants to live. Morality aside, the CIA&rsquo;s use of water boarding made men say anything to keep from drowning. Saying anything, or even providing &ldquo;good information,&rdquo; is a million miles away from providing intelligence, (i.e. something that is most certainly not public knowledge). For that reason and to their peril, the British learned that torture was ineffective in the Boer War. Guns and torture are anathema to intelligence-gathering activities, but they are also bedfellows.JD:Is it hard for retiring foreign-service officers to adapt to private life?MD:Most people who leave are achievers. They get jobs in the top ranks of industry, commerce, government, or maybe some place similar in the arts. But all of us struggle. We are trained to believe that we are better than everyone else when the reality is that we are not. We&rsquo;ve simply seen different, odd things and had to do a job that requires inordinate self-belief. It&rsquo;s taken me ten years to adjust to not being a spy. I&rsquo;m still adjusting.JD:What about the service do you miss?MD:I miss the friendships I had with my foreign agents. They would do the most unbelievably brave things for me, but would always be aware of the danger they were in and their own mortality. I respected them and loved them more than MI6 or anyone else, and that is how it is supposed to be. My agents were my family. We laughed together in one-on-one meetings in swanky hotels and war-zone ditches. We cried together. I held their hands and told them to be brave. I watched the fear and defiance in their eyes as they went back to their tasks. But I was never Matthew Dunn. I was someone else even if the emotion was real. I miss my agents, but they don&rsquo;t miss me because they never knew who I was. I regret that more than anything.",

His travel  schedule was set 18 months out. Once, he was so obsessed with impressing a potential client that he  tracked down the man's travel schedule, booked the seat next to him on a flight, schmoozed the guy  all the way to Australia, landed the account, and flew immediately back to Manhattan. His Type-A ways vanished when, at age 53, a top neurosurgeon in New York told him he had late-stage brain cancer. \"His eyes told me I would die soon. It was late spring. I had seen my last autumn  in New York.\"&nbsp;There are no TV-movie-style miracle treatments or  extensions of his life expectancy; he's told he has maybe 3 months, and he doesn't spend any energy  hoping for a cure. True to his CEO style, he creates goals for himself, lists of friends to visit for the  last time; he meditates; he tries to create as many \"perfect Moments\" that he can, during dinner or  phone conversations with friends, and realized how rare those moments of connection and joy  were in his \"previous life.\"Chasing Daylightis as much a self-criticism of his job-before-family ways as it is a meditation on time and a transition to a tranquil, spiritual state utterly foreign  to him as a CEO. O'Kelly's absolutely more fulfilled by the soul work that he finishes in 100 days,  compared to his 30 years of corporate promotions and accolades, and he utterly convinces readers  to ponder their own situation, whether \"in the gloaming\" of life as he was or not. --Erica Jorgensen",

        "0099472287": "Four women who work the night shift in a Tokyo factory that produces boxed lunches find their lives twisted beyond repair in this grimly compelling crime novel, which won Japan's top mystery award, the Grand Prix, for its already heralded author, now making her first appearance in English. Despite the female bonding, this dark, violent novel is more evocative of Gogol or Dostoyevsky than Thelma and Louise. When Yayoi, the youngest and prettiest of the women, strangles her philandering gambler husband with his own belt in an explosion of rage, she turns instinctively for help to her co-worker Masako, an older and wiser woman whose own family life has fallen apart in less dramatic fashion. To help her cut up and get rid of the dead body, Masako recruits Yoshie and Kuniko, two fellow factory workers caught up in other kinds of domestic traps. In Snyder's smoothly unobtrusive translation, all of Kirino's characters are touching and believable. And even when the action stretches to include a slick loan shark from Masako's previous life and a pathetically lost and lonely man of mixed Japanese and Brazilian parentage, the gritty realism of everyday existence in the underbelly of Japan's consumer society comes across with pungent force.

Switching uncomfortably at times from dialogue in a rough patois to exposition in a language both formal and sociological, George delivers a stinging indictment of a society unable to respond effectively to the needs of its poorer citizens. Kendra Osborne, a 40-year-old woman with modest ambitions and plans to achieve them, has no idea how to cope when her mother \"dumps\" her sister's three children on her doorstep and heads for Jamaica. Fifteen-year-old Ness, 11-year-old Joel and seven-year-old Toby each have a wealth of problems exacerbated by their mixed-race heritage. It's no accident that George refers to Dickens on the first page of this earnest but perhaps overly didactic novel, which focuses on the burdens borne by Joel as he's swept by forces he can neither understand nor control into a fatal encounter.8-city author tour.

He meets with some initial success, beheading second-rate magician Kasabian (whose head becomes Stark's smart-mouthed sidekick), but he can't find Faim. Instead he encounters Homeland Security agents, a near-psychotic angel and some odd nonhuman, nonangelic beings called the kissi. Darkly atmospheric settings, such as a posh gentlemen's club where angels are tortured in an attempt to bring about Armageddon, bring this violent fantasy into sharp, compelling focus.(Aug.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0062118781": "Gr 9 Up-A beach house, 10 teenagers, no parents, and the promise of a weekend-long party: friends Meg and Minnie embrace the exclusive invitation, despite the fact that neither of the girls is close to the host. But a storm is brewing on Henry Island. The wind is howling, the rain is pouring, and the local ferry won't be back until morning. Then people start dying. A creepy DVD warns the teens of their imminent demise, and red hash marks on the wall tally the deaths as the guests' guilty secrets are exposed and they're picked off one by one. In the end, it is up to Meg to save herself and figure out who is killing her friends and why. Though character development and motivation are a bit weak, McNeil's novel nicely parallels Agatha Christie's classic And Then There Were None (originally titled Ten Little Indians in the United States), and is likewise a quick-paced thriller full of half-facts and red herrings that take readers through the twists and turns of a deadly weekend. While it might not be considered an amazing teen mystery, among the numerous adaptations and stories that borrow from Christie's 1939 novel, McNeil's book holds its own.-Jennifer Miskec, Longwood University, Farmville, VA&#x3B1;(c) Copyright 2011.

        "0060731583": "As Commander in Chief of the United States Central Command from July 2000 through July 2003, Tommy Franks led the American and Coalition forces to victory in both Afghanistan and Iraq. Unsurprisingly, the portions ofAmerican Soldiercovering these wars are the most interesting because they combine military maneuvers, political wrangling, and lots of action and commentary. This does not mean, however, that the rest of his autobiography is dull. General Franks's writing is clear and engaging and his insider's perspective is informative and interesting, particularly when he explains how the military moved into the 21st century by emphasizing speed, agility, and better cooperation among the various branches--a significant shift from the first Persian Gulf war just a decade earlier.In addition to his years as a war general, his memoir also covers his childhood, his early years in the Army, his tours of Vietnam, and how he contemplated retirement before being called up as commander of Central Command, \"the most diverse, strategically vital&#x97;and unstable&#x97;region of the planet.\" Ever the diplomat, General Franks offers insights, but little criticism of individuals. Other than expressing admiration for his own staff and for President Bush and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld in particular, he is tight-lipped about any conflict within the administration that may have occurred regarding policy issues. (The one exception is counterterrorism specialist Richard Clarke. \"I never received a single operational recommendation, or a single page of actionable intelligence, from Richard Clarke,\" he writes). He also writes that he was surprised by the absence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and that no WMDs were used against American troops. Still, the invasion of Iraq was justified in his eyes: \"While we may not have found actual WMD stockpiles, what the Coalition discovered was the equivalent of a disassembled pistol, lying on a table beside neatly arranged trays of bullets.\"American Soldieris a compelling look at the war on terrorism from one who served on the frontlines as both a warrior and a diplomat. --Shawn Carkonen",

Six-year-old Adam Walsh was abducted from a crowded Sears store in Hollywood, Florida, in 1981. Later, he was murdered and decapitated. Identifying Adam&#xFFFD;s killer took 25 years. His parents turned into tireless advocates for missing and abused children; Adam&#xFFFD;s father, John Walsh, moved from a sales job to being the executive producer and host of America&#xFFFD;s Most Wanted. This forceful account, written with Matthews, former sergeant with the Miami Beach Police Department, who worked the case for years, gives readers the ultimate insider&#xFFFD;s account of the grueling search for Adam&#xFFFD;s killer and for the evidence to convict him. While many true-crime books claim to shine a light on society by examining one particular case, this account actually does.

        "0060555661": "Among the library of investment books promising no-fail strategies for riches, Benjamin Graham's classic,The Intelligent Investor, offers no guarantees or gimmicks but overflows with the wisdom at the core of all good portfolio management.The hallmark of Graham's philosophy is not profit maximization but loss minimization. In this respect,The Intelligent Investoris a book for true investors, not speculators or day traders. He provides, \"in a form suitable for the laymen, guidance in adoption and execution of an investment policy\" (1). This policy is inherently for the longer term and requires a commitment of effort. Where the speculator follows market trends, the investor uses discipline, research, and his analytical ability to make unpopular but sound investments in bargains relative to current asset value. Graham coaches the investor to develop a rational plan for buying stocks and bonds, and he argues that this plan must be a bulwark against emotional behavior that will always be tempting during abrupt bull and bear markets.Since it was first published in 1949, Graham's investment guide has sold over a million copies and has been praised by such luminaries as Warren E. Buffet as \"the best book on investing ever written.\" These accolades are well deserved. In its new form--with commentary on each chapter and extensive footnotes prepared by seniorMoneyeditor, Jason Zweig--the classic is now updated in light of changes in investment vehicles and market activities since 1972. What remains is a better book. Graham's sage advice, analytical guides, and cautionary tales are still valid for the contemporary investor, and Zweig's commentaries demonstrate the relevance of Graham's principles in light of 1990s and early twenty-first century market trends.--Patrick O'Kelley",

Scattered among the ruins of great portions of Emerald City, many residents have been skinned and bloodied, supposedly by the barbaric Yunamatas. Travel caravan leader Oatsie Manglehand stumbles upon the body of an unknown young man, badly beaten but still alive. She presents him to the wise Superior Maunt, who recognizes the hurt boy as Liir, rumored to be the dead Witch's secreted son.

Along the way, a headspinning cast of vividly described, eccentric characters emerges, but nothing prepares Liir for Candle's shocking surprise announcement.

        "0061374229": "Amazon Best of the Month, June 2008: It's gutsy for a debut novelist to offer a modern take onHamletset in rural Wisconsin--particularly one in which the young hero, born mute, communicates with people, dogs, and the occasional ghost through his own mix of sign and body language. But David Wroblewski's extraordinary way with language inThe Story of Edgar Sawtelleimmerses readers in a living, breathing world that is both fantastic and utterly believable. In selecting for temperament and a special intelligence, Edgar's grandfather started a line of unusual dogs--the Sawtelles--and his sons carried on his work. But among human families, undesirable traits aren't so easily predicted, and clashes can erupt with tragic force. Edgar's tale takes you to the extremes of what humans must endure, and when you're finally released, you will come back to yourself feeling wiser, and flush with gratitude. And you will have remembered what magnificent alchemy a finely wrought novel can work. --Mari MalcolmBook DescriptionBorn mute, speaking only in sign, Edgar Sawtelle leads an idyllic life with his parents on their farm in remote northern Wisconsin. For generations, the Sawtelles have raised and trained a fictional breed of dog whose thoughtful companionship is epitomized by Almondine, Edgar's lifelong friend and ally. But with the unexpected return of Claude, Edgar's paternal uncle, turmoil consumes the Sawtelles' once peaceful home. When Edgar's father dies suddenly, Claude insinuates himself into the life of the farm--and into Edgar's mother's affections.Grief-stricken and bewildered, Edgar tries to prove Claude played a role in his father's death, but his plan backfires--spectacularly. Forced to flee into the vast wilderness lying beyond the farm, Edgar comes of age in the wild, fighting for his survival and that of the three yearling dogs who follow him. But his need to face his father's murderer and his devotion to the Sawtelle dogs turn Edgar ever homeward.David Wroblewski is a master storyteller, and his breathtaking scenes--the elemental north woods, the sweep of seasons, an iconic American barn, a fateful vision rendered in the falling rain--create a riveting family saga, a brilliant exploration of the limits of language, and a compulsively readable modern classic.Double Life, with Dogs: An Amazon Exclusive Essay by David WroblewskiWe write the stories we wish we could read. There's no other reason to do it, to spend years pacing around your basement, mumbling, pecking at a keyboard, turning your back on a world that offers such a feast of delicious fruits.The Story of Edgar Sawtellecame about because some time ago I wished I could read a novel about a boy and his dog, one that integrated our contemporary knowledge of canine behavior, cognition, and origins with my experience of living with dogs; if possible, something flavored with the uncynical Midwestern sense of heart and purpose so familiar from my childhood (and something which, in truth, I've spent much my adult life being slightly ashamed of, as if either heart or purpose were embarrassing attributes for a grown-up to display). I'd recently come to know a good dog, maybe the best dog I'd ever met, and the subject of people and dogs and ethics and character suddenly seemed urgent. But when I went looking for such a story, I had to go back almost a hundred years, back to Jack London'sCall of the Wild. That was a surprise. A little while after that, an idea for a story came to me--not the whole thing, but enough to start.Continue ReadingDouble Life, With DogsPraise from Stephen King\"I flat-out lovedThe Story of Edgar Sawtelle, and spent twelve happy evenings immersed in the world David Wroblewski has created. As I neared the end, I kept finding excuses to put the book aside for a little, not because I didn't like it, but because I liked it too much; I didn't want it to end. Dog-lovers in particular will find themselves riveted by this story, because the canine world has never been explored with such imagination and emotional resonance. Yet in the end, this isn't a novel about dogs or heartland America--although it is a deeply American work of literature. It's a novel about the human heart, and the mysteries that live there, understood but impossible to articulate. Yet in the person of Edgar Sawtelle, a mute boy who takes three of his dogs on a brave and dangerous odyssey, Wroblewskidoesarticulate them, and splendidly. I closed the book with that regret readers feel only after experiencing the best stories:It's over,you think,and I won't read another one this good for a long, long time.In truth, there's never been a book quite likeThe Story of Edgar Sawtelle. I thought ofHamletwhen I was reading it, andWatership Down, andThe Night of the Hunter, andThe Life of Pi--but halfway through, I put all comparisons aside and let it just be itself.I'm pretty sure this book is going to be a bestseller, but unlike some, it deserves to be. It's also going to be the subject of a great many reading groups, and when the members take upEdgar, I think they will be apt to stick to the book and forget the neighborhood gossip.Wonderful, mysterious, long and satisfying: readers who pick up this novel are going to enter a richer world. I envy them the trip. I don't re-read many books, because life is too short. I will be re-reading this one.\"",

When she discovers that Nicholas has been separated from his trust fund until he marries a suitable lady, she becomes infuriated. A notorious rake and heartless cad, Nicholas is cut from the same matrimonial cloth as her late husband, so if Nicholas thinks Belinda will help him find some poor, naive American heiress to wed, well, he is sadly mistaken.

Lulu Minturn is a white Californian who&rsquo;d run away with a Chinese painter, established the best courtesan house in Shanghai and given birth to a beautiful &ldquo;Eurasian&rdquo; (in the parlance of the time) daughter, Violet. Soon, either because she was tricked or deceitful, Lulu abandons Violet and flees back to America; history soon is in danger of repeating itself when Violet gives birth to her own daughter. (Eventually, the scene shifts to California, where the family searches for redemption and reconciliation.) Nobody does mother-daughter angst and cross cultural conflict better than Tan, who has been literally writing the book(s) on these topics for years. What makes this novel special is its meticulous language--readers may be struck by the juxtaposition of poetry and Anglosaxon equivalents in descriptions of courtesans&rsquo; sex lives--and its elucidation of the cultural upheavals at the time. This is as much a historical novel as it is a family story, at once intimate and sweeping, personal and political.

        "0061702587": "Product DescriptionBlending history and anecdote, geography and reminiscence, science and exposition, theNew York Timesbestselling author ofKrakatoatells the breathtaking saga of the magnificent Atlantic Ocean, setting it against the backdrop of mankind's intellectual evolution.Until a thousand years ago, no humans ventured into the Atlantic or imagined traversing its vast infinity. But once the first daring mariners successfully navigated to far shores&#x2014;whether it was the Vikings, the Irish, the Chinese, Christopher Columbus in the north, or the Portuguese and the Spanish in the south&#x2014;the Atlantic evolved in the world's growing consciousness of itself as an enclosed body of water bounded by the Americas to the West, and by Europe and Africa to the East.Atlanticis a biography of this immense space, of a sea which has defined and determined so much about the lives of the millions who live beside or near its tens of thousands of miles of coast.The Atlantic has been central to the ambitions of explorers, scientists and warriors, and it continues to affect our character, attitudes, and dreams. Poets to potentates, seers to sailors, fishermen to foresters&#x2014;all have a relationship with this great body of blue-green sea and regard her as friend or foe, adversary or ally, depending on circumstance or fortune. Simon Winchester chronicles that relationship, making the Atlantic come vividly alive. Spanning from the earth's geological origins to the age of exploration, World War II battles to modern pollution, his narrative is epic and awe-inspiring.A Q&amp;A with Author Simon WinchesterQ:Writing a &#x201C;biography&#x201D; of a massive subject like the Atlantic Ocean is audacious and seemingly daunting. What inspired you to write the book, how long did it take you, and what did your research entail?Winchester:It occurred to me one afternoon while, for the umpteenth time, I was crossing &#x2018;the pond&#x2019; on a flight between London and New York, that we took the waters below us far too much for granted. I thought back to the first crossing I had ever made, back in 1963, on a ship&#x2014;and the romance of the ocean as I saw it then&#x2014;and I decided that it could be very interesting to look into the role the Atlantic has played in humankind&#x2019;s history. I spent the next eighteen months travelling, going everywhere from the Faroes and Iceland in the north, to Tristan da Cunha and Patagonia in the south. The book itself took eight months to write, four to edit.Q:What was the most unusual or fascinating fact you discovered while researching and writingAtlantic?Winchester:I remain intrigued by the thought that the State of Israel was in effect born as a result of a lack of cordite in the Royal Navy&#x2019;s ammunition stores during the Battle of the Atlantic in 1916.  A White Russian biologist, Chaim Weizmann, at the time a professor at the University of Manchester, worked out how to solve this problem, and when the British government of the time offered to reward him for his game-changing invention, he declined&#x2014;asking only for Arthur Balfour to make his famous Declaration of 1917, which led to the formation of Israel.Q:Why is the Atlantic significant in the development of Western civilization? Is there one important thing about the ocean we should know but do not?Winchester:The first true parliamentary democracy was founded in the Atlantic, in Iceland in the tenth century&#x2014;and the concept spread rapidly through northern Europe. It was then followed in short order by the establishment of a similarly organized network of traders and trade routes, the so-called Hanseatic leaguers. That two such crucial aspects of modern human civilization&#x2014;government and trade&#x2014;are based still today on principles laid down beside the Atlantic Ocean is a fact little remembered by most &#x2014;and when I found the story out, it astonished and delighted me.Q:You are a sailor yourself. Have you sailed the Atlantic? What was the experience like?Winchester:I have sailed the entire Indian Ocean; and I have sailed a little in the South Atlantic&#x2014;undertaking the voyage in a tiny (30ft) steel gaff-rigged schooner.  But while I had few major problems sailing between the coasts of India and South Africa, once I had &#x2018;rounded the bend&#x2019;, as it were, and passed into the Atlantic, everything changed: the sea became very rough and (a particular problem in a steel yacht) very cold.  And so I abandoned the Atlantic attempt&#x2014;a decision that gives me ever greater respect today for the ocean itself, and for those sailors who are brave and determined enough to sail it. (In my defense&#x2014;since 16 year olds now make the journey&#x2014;I should point out that I went out without radio or radar, and with only a sextant as a navigation aid. GPS and e-mail make modern yachting a somewhat less arduous business. But the inescapable fact that I wiped out troubles me still. A bit.)Q:How do today&#x2019;s giant cruise ships compare to their predecessors like the Queen Mary or the Titanic? Have we lost something fundamental in how we experience the ocean with modernization?Winchester:I detest the big cruise ships of today, immense Vegas style monstrosities filled with amusements specifically designed&#x2014;or so it seems&#x2014;utterly to detach the passenger from the realities of the ocean he is crossing (and to make even more money for the shipowners, of course). One surely goes to sea to experience the sea, it seems to me&#x2014;and if you are in a gigantic floating play-center, and one that barely moves with the waves, then why not just stay home, and in doing so burn less fuel and pollute the world a little less?Q:Is it possible for 21st century humans to regain a sense of awe and respect for this magnificent natural wonder? What might it take for us to do so?Winchester:It is my fond hope that just a few good people who may read and like this book will stop for a moment, and perhaps then begin to think about and regard the ocean in a different way. And then maybe go down to the shore and look at it, and consider some of its wonders. And then, most importantly, tell the next generation that this body of water, like all the great oceanic bodies of water on the planet, is a rare and precious entity deserving of our care and our respect.  I realize this may be no more than wishful thinking: but after writing this book I have come to feel a very powerful connection with the Atlantic Ocean, and I so very much want others to look at it in the same way.Q:How does the Atlantic compare to other oceans? What makes it special/unique?Winchester:Of the world&#x2019;s great oceans the Atlantic is not the biggest; it is not the prettiest; it is not the most benign. But it does possess the greatest concentration of the marker-events of human history. And if, as seems unarguable, the Mediterranean could once fairly be said to have been the inland sea of classical civilization, then surely the Atlantic Ocean, by virtue of this huge concentration of ideas, events, inventions and developments, has become, and unarguably also, the inland sea of modern civilization. No other ocean comes close to filling this role &#x2013; which is why the Atlantic rises, head and shoulders, above all of its taller, prettier and calmer maritime cousins.",

The book swings into gear when she returns home to find that her ne'er-do-well ex, Nick, has recruited her partner Jenks's son in a criminal enterprise&mdash;and gotten them both imprisoned by Weres in Michigan, apparently for stealing a priceless Were artifact. With the help of some borderline black magic, Jenks&mdash;a pixie&mdash;is given human proportions in order to accompany Rachel on a mission to rescue his son. Finding the jailed pixie ends up the easiest task in an operation that quickly spirals out of control after Rachel decides she must also rescue the errant Nick. Harrison provides conflict aplenty as Rachel debates how far into the black arts she'll venture to accomplish a good end; past and present boyfriends vie for her attention; and Weres battle vampires for supremacy.(July)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Charles Shake Bouchon steps out of a California prison resolved to stay free and clear; 48 hours later he's effectively double-crossed powerful Armenian L.A. mob boss Alexandra Ilandryan, ripped off dangerous Las Vegas powerhouse Dick the Whale Moby and impulsively rescued exotic con woman Gina Clement, who may be the most dangerous of the three. Extremely rare, highly unusual religious artifacts play a key role as the 42-year-old Shake attempts to extricate himself from a situation that gets more complex and deadly by the hour.

He said it began the summer Dill came to us, when Dill first gave us the idea of making Boo Radley come out.\"Set in the small Southern town of Maycomb, Alabama, during the Depression,To Kill a Mockingbirdfollows three years in the life of 8-year-old Scout Finch, her brother, Jem, and their father, Atticus--three years punctuated by the arrest and eventual trial of a young black man accused of raping a white woman. Though her story explores big themes, Harper Lee chooses to tell it through the eyes of a child. The result is a tough and tender novel of race, class, justice, and the pain of growing up.Like the slow-moving occupants of her fictional town, Lee takes her time getting to the heart of her tale; we first meet the Finches the summer before Scout's first year at school. She, her brother, and Dill Harris, a boy who spends the summers with his aunt in Maycomb, while away the hours reenacting scenes fromDraculaand plotting ways to get a peek at the town bogeyman, Boo Radley. At first the circumstances surrounding the alleged rape of Mayella Ewell, the daughter of a drunk and violent white farmer, barely penetrate the children's consciousness. Then Atticus is called on to defend the accused, Tom Robinson, and soon Scout and Jem find themselves caught up in events beyond their understanding. During the trial, the town exhibits its ugly side, but Lee offers plenty of counterbalance as well--in the struggle of an elderly woman to overcome her morphine habit before she dies; in the heroism of Atticus Finch, standing up for what he knows is right; and finally in Scout's hard-won understanding that most people are essentially kind \"when you really see them.\" By turns funny, wise, and heartbreaking,To Kill a Mockingbirdis one classic that continues to speak to new generations, and deserves to be reread often.--Alix Wilber--This text refers to theMass Market Paperbackedition.",

April and Frank Wheeler are a young, ostensibly thriving couple living with their two children in a prosperous Connecticut suburb in the mid-1950s. However, like the characters in John Updike's similarly themedCouples, the self-assured exterior masks a creeping frustration at their inability to feel fulfilled in their relationships or careers. Frank is mired in a well-paying but boring office job and April is a housewife still mourning the demise of her hoped-for acting career. Determined to identify themselves as superior to the mediocre sprawl of suburbanites who surround them, they decide to move to France where they will be better able to develop their true artistic sensibilities, free of the consumerist demands of capitalist America. As their relationship deteriorates into an endless cycle of squabbling, jealousy and recriminations, their trip and their dreams of self-fulfillment are thrown into jeopardy.Yates's incisive, moving, and often very funny prose weaves a tale that is at once a fascinating period piece and a prescient anticipation of the way we live now. Many of the cultural motifs seem quaintly dated--the early-evening cocktails, Frank's illicit lunch breaks with his secretary, the way Frank isn't averse to knocking April around when she speaks out of turn--and yet the quiet desperation at thwarted dreams reverberates as much now as it did years ago.

Humanity's collective intelligence will save the day, just as it has over the centuries. Ridley puts current perceptions about violence, wealth, and the environment into historical perspective, reaching back thousands of years to advocate global free trade, smaller government, and the use of fossil fuels.

The year is 1959 and the place is the Belgian Congo. Nathan, a Baptist preacher, has come to spread the Word in a remote village reachable only by airplane. To say that he and his family are woefully unprepared would be an understatement: \"We came from Bethlehem, Georgia, bearing Betty Crocker cake mixes into the jungle,\" says Leah, one of Nathan's daughters. But of course it isn't long before they discover that the tremendous humidity has rendered the mixes unusable, their clothes are unsuitable, and they've  arrived in the middle of political upheaval as the Congolese seek to wrest independence from Belgium. In addition to poisonous snakes, dangerous animals, and the hostility of the villagers to Nathan's fiery take-no-prisoners brand of Christianity, there are also rebels in the jungle and the threat of war in the air.

The first part ofThe Poisonwood Biblerevolves around Nathan's intransigent, bullying personality and his effect on both his family and the village they have come to. As political instability grows in the Congo, so does the local witch doctor's animus toward the Prices, and both seem to converge with tragic consequences about halfway through the novel. From that point on, the family is dispersed and the novel follows each member's fortune across a span of more than 30 years.The Poisonwood Bibleis arguably Barbara Kingsolver's most ambitious work, and it reveals both her great strengths and her weaknesses. As Nathan Price's wife and daughters tell their stories in alternating chapters, Kingsolver does a good job of differentiating the voices. But at times they can grate--teenage Rachel's tendency towards precious malapropisms is particularly annoying (students practice their \"French congregations\"; Nathan's refusal to take his family home is a \"tapestry of justice\"). More problematic is Kingsolver's tendency to wear her politics on her sleeve; this is particularly evident in the second half of the novel, in which she uses her characters as mouthpieces to explicate the complicated and tragic history of the Belgian Congo.Despite these weaknesses, Kingsolver's fully realized, three-dimensional characters makeThe Poisonwood Biblecompelling, especially in the first half, when Nathan Price is still at the center of the action. And in her treatment of Africa and the Africans she is at her best, exhibiting the acute perception, moral engagement, and lyrical prose that have made her previous novels so successful.--Alix Wilber",

Addison's talent is that of a Divergent, the ability to see into the future and determine which path she should take. With the help of her best friend, she looks forward six weeks and uncovers not only the chance of finding love in both futures, but also the possibility that danger, secrets, and obsession may destroy the lives of those she cares about the most.

So saysThe Sims, a game that lets you create, direct, and manage the lives of SimCity's residents.The game begins with the creation of your simulated people: pick a name and a gender, decide on personality/astrological sign, and then choose a look from a variety of heads, bodies, and skin tones. Name, gender, and appearance don't affect gameplay much, but personality determines how your Sim plays with others. A serious, neat Sim might go crazy living with a sloppy party animal--or opposites might attract, and the two could end up falling in love.After creation, the next step is to find a place to live. Again, the player can choose from among the empty houses in the neighborhood or decide to buy some land and design a dream house. Building houses is a blast, and the easy-to-use house design interface could almost be its own game: players design the floor plan, put up walls, pick carpet, wallpaper, and siding, and fill the house with furniture, decorations, fixtures, and appliances. You're limited only by your imagination--and your Sims' pocketbook. But the choices you make in designing and decorating your Sims' house are vital.A good general rule is that the more expensive the object, the better its ability to satisfy Sim needs. Each little Sim person has needs (Hunger, Comfort, Hygiene, Bladder, Energy, Fun, Social, and Room) which can be satisfied by interaction with other Sims or purchased objects: throw a party with the help of a rockin' stereo system, and watch your Sims' Social and Fun ratings improve. Have one of your Sims whip up some food from the refrigerator, and you'll satisfy the Hunger needs of your guests. Or have your Sim engage another Sim in a game of chess: not only will their Fun and Social moods improve, both Sims will gain some points in their Logic skill rating--which might help on the job.One gameplay goal is to improve your Sim so he or she can climb a career ladder, which nets him or her more money, which allows the purchase of higher quality stuff, which lets you improve your Sim even more. With proper care, your Sim can have a mate, kids, and a mansion with an indoor pool.Mismanage your new, simulated family, and you'll be faced with the worst of MTV'sThe Real World: jealousies will ignite, fights will break out, jobs will be lost, and the house will fall apart. Bringing about such a calamity is almost as much fun as guiding your Sims to material paradise, and takes considerably less time.Triumph or tragedy, each significant event in a Sim's life is captured in a snapshot and saved in a photo album for later viewing. Players can also take photos any time they wish. The photo album feature is cool by itself, but the best part is that you can upload the album to www.thesims.com and share your Sims' sagas with the world. Entire families can also be uploaded and downloaded, as can houses. Want to re-create and manage your own version ofFriends? Download the free face and body editor and make Sim clones of the Ross, Rachel, and the rest. Want to perfectly re-create the set? Snag the free wall and floor texture editor. Feeling a little silly? Add Darth Vader to the family and see what happens.With The Sims, you can create whatever--and whomever--you desire.Toying with the lives, successes, and emotional states of dozens of little Sims is undeniably fun. In the same way thatSimCityplayers develop a condescending attitude toward real-world city planners,The Simsplayers will begin to see life as a series of needs-satisfying challenges; the game gets in your head. But that's OK: limitless gameplay, endless variety, imaginative Internet features, and the ability to play matchmaker/landlord/counselor/God makesThe Simsa great way to increase your own Fun score. --Mike FehlauerPros:Unique, addictive, fun gameplayIncluded photo album feature records triumphs and tragediesFree uploads and downloads expand the game and allow swapping with other playersSims aresmart--it's sometimes best to just let them act on their ownCons:Addictive gameplay may cause loss of sleep, jobComplex behavioral modeling program--requires serious computing powerNo pets other than fishSex and aliens.

The  furnishings  are mostly grouped by theme, with the medieval dungeon option the most  authoritative of the bunch. (Little Cassandra Goth has beenlongingto  read by torch light all along.)Our personal favorite is the futuristic theme, with an optional, but  expensive,  maid/gardener robot to take care of the fabulous modern furnishings.

Bring on the  mai tais with a tiki-heavy islander theme. There's also a startling collection  of carpeting and objects best grouped under the design ideal we call \"demented  clown.\"The attention-getting rarities include: a lame fortune-telling ball (our  advice  mostly centered around hiring a maid), a voodoo doll for hexing roommates,  and a  genie who delivers as much bad as good (dead plants, anyone?). And, yes,  there's  a vibrating bed to give your Sims the spice they've been missing.While the expansion didn't blow us away, it did provide more of the humor and  novelty trueSimsdie-hards will appreciate.

Set in New Orleans in the early 19th century, this atmospheric tale portrays the romance between Lysette Kersaint, a strong-willed Creole who is on the run from her abusive stepfather and an arranged marriage to a man she loathes, and Maximilien Vallerand, a notorious rake and widower who is rumored to have strangled his adulterous wife. Lysette finds protection in Max's home, but she soon learns that he plans to use her as a pawn to exact revenge against her intended, Etienne Sagesse, his sworn enemy. The tension between the two quickly heats up, but before they can find happiness together, they must settle the mysteries of Max's past. The romance between Max and Lysette is compelling, but what really sets this book apart is Kleypass ability to make the period come alive. With the ease of a skilled seamstress, Kleypas weaves in dozens of details, touching on everything from the political tensions between Mexico and the American territories to the cultural differences between Creoles and Americans. Kleypas doesn't shy away from developing her characters either.

Krakatoa erupted at a time when technologies like the  telegraph were becoming commonplace and Asian trade routes were being  expanded by northern European companies. This bustling colonial backdrop  provides an effective canvas for the suspense leading up to August 27th,  1883, when the nearby island of Krakatoa would violently vaporize.  Winchester describes the eruption through the eyes of its survivors, and  readers will be as horrified and mesmerized as eyewitnesses were as the  death toll reached nearly 40,000 (almost all of whom died from tsunamis  generated by the unimaginably strong shock waves of the eruption). Ships  were thrown miles inshore, endless rains of hot ash engulfed those towns  not drowned by 100 foot waves, and vast rafts of pumice clogged the hot  sea. The explosion was heard thousands of miles away, and the eruption's  shock wave traveled around the world seven times. But the book's biggest  surprise is not the riveting catalog of the volcano's effects; rather,  it is Winchester's contention that the Dutch abandonment of their  Indonesian colonies after the disaster left local survivors to seek  comfort in radical Islam, setting the stage for a volatile future for  the region.--Therese Littleton--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

        "B00004S9AF": "Talk about going out with a bang! Sony Computer Entertainment released  its four-discThe Legend of Dragoonfor the PlayStation only months  before the release of that console's successor, the PlayStation2. This very  absorbing role-playing game, with hours upon hours of story and inventive  gameplay, might just be the last great title for the glorious PSX.The copious story begins with Dart, a vengeful young man with spiky hair and red  armor who embarks on a desperate rescue mission to break his childhood  sweetheart out of a castle prison. The two join forces with a knight who is  trying to end a war that's destroying the region. Dart soon learns that he is a  Dragoon--a human who's privy to the spiritual power of dragons. Like all RPG  heroes, Dart is up against impossible odds, but his newfound Dragoon magic and  battle skills go a long way toward making the bet even money.And that's just the beginning. Grab a spare memory card and a comfy chair and be  prepared to spend at least 20 hours getting through the first disk (there are  three others just like it in the double-wide case). It's hard to sustain a  player through this kind of time span, butThe Legend of Dragoontakes  chances and wins. For example, its battle system is turn based, so you can  actually use some strategy, but it also features special \"additions,\" or  fighting combos that unfold if you match the X button to that addition's timing.  When handling three players' additions, each with unique sequences, it can be  quite challenging. You can increase the potency of the elemental magic up to 160  percent by quickly tapping X during your cast. Also, the perspectives often  change between battles--players will direct the action from behind the heroes,  behind the villains, looking down from above, and off to the side.There are a couple downsides to the game. First, the stylized transitions into  and out of battle mode, while initially cool, quickly become  exhausting--especially when running the gauntlet through lesser foes in the wilderness or  lower ramparts of a castle. The game's story is built such that you're watching  the sometimes goofy dialog as a spectator rather than participating in it. There  are a few occasions when the game will prompt you to choose from two different  responses, but often either response will bring about the same conclusion. That  tightly controlled narrative, however, often works in the player's favor by  keeping the game flowing instead of the wandering common in other RPGs, where  players waste time looking to each townsperson for direction.Overall, the game's wonderfully illustrated sets, light exploration and problem  solving, and a handful of jaw-dropping full-motion video scenes makeThe  Legend of Dragoonfun to play and hard to put down.--Porter HallPros:Hours upon hours of story and gameplayTurn-based battle made more exciting by combo-attack-style \"additions\"Many different monsters, spells, weapons, and itemsCons:Very linear gameplay offers no chance to affect outcomeStylish pre- and postbattle sequences quickly grow tiresome",

And so Hannity joins the \"neocon\" chorus, positing that totalitarian regimes, such as Hussein's in Iraq, Hitler's Germany and the former Soviet Union, serve as breeding grounds for evil, thus justifying President Bush's policy of pre-emptive action against countries that could threaten American interests. Despite \"irrefutable evidence,\" Hannity writes, today's liberals inexplicably doubt that \"absolute evil truly exists,\" and instead foolishly cling to the idea that the world's problems might arise from social, psychological and cultural differences or from economic inequality. Fans of Hannity&#xE2;&#x80;\"Christian conservatives in particular&#xE2;&#x80;\"will no doubt embrace this straightforward call to arms. Many readers, however, will find Hannity's \"irrefutable\" evidence to be anything but, and his selective use of history and circular logic raise far more questions than it settles. Two final chapters examine what Hannity considers to be the dangerous, partisan policies espoused by the current slate of Democratic presidential candidates.

A 26-year-old Londoner, Lucy is the kind of woman who thinks that any man who's decent to her must be Mr. Wrong. But when she visits a fortune-teller with a trio of mismatched friends, a marriage is predicted for the near future. When the fortune-teller's prophecies for the other three come true in peculiar ways, even disbelieving, boyfriendless Lucy begins to suspect that, somehow, wedding bells will ring for her. The identity of the lucky man will come as no surprise, though Lucy remains oblivious until the very end, but there are many eligible bachelors on the scene, among them Gus, Lucy's sexy but unreliable new lover; Daniel, her oldest friend; Chuck, a handsome American; and Adrian, the video shop man. The attendant mayhem includes drunken meals at ethnic restaurants, flamenco dancing accidents, blind dates gone wrong and many delicious confessions and revelations. As Lucy says, \"I was still at that stage in my life when I thought that weekdays were for recovering from the weekend,\" but more often than not, her weekdays are as full of exhausting fun as her weekends. Surprisingly for a comic novel, the book also takes on the serious themes of clinical depression and alcoholism, handling both with sensitivity and humor. Throughout, the effervescent narrative is fueled by witty repartee; though its outcome may be predictable, its sentiments are heartfelt, and its progress is sprightly.

Clearly, this has not always been the case. Frequently in the crosshairs of critics are the Christian wars against Muslims known as the Crusades, commonly viewed as the birth of European imperialism and the forced spread of Christianity. But what if we've had it all wrong? What if the Crusades were a justifiable response to a strong and determined foe? Stark, a prominent sociologist and author of 27 books on history and religion, has penned a compelling argument that these bloody encounters had less to do with spreading Christianity than with responding to an ever more dangerous enemy&mdash;the emerging Islamic empire. There is much to be learned here. Filled with fascinating historical glimpses of monks and Templars, priests and pilgrims, kings and contemplatives, Stark pulls it all together and challenges us to reconsider our view of the Crusades.(Oct.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have. In addition to adding multi-player action via xBox live, or via networked consoles, the Xbox version of Doom 3 also adds a great two-player cooperative mode.Hell on MarsYour character is a low ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the United Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars Research Facility. That's pretty much all the back-story you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the story-line department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of theDoomfranchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?) it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well crafted sound effects were successful at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly-lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth, ethereal Revenant fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy, a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall.

He is also, as any reader of his startling memoirTravelsknows, a bit of a mystic--he is entirely open to notions spouted by spoon-bending psychics that most science writers would scorn.Sphereis not only a gratifying sci-fi suspense tale; it also reflects Crichton's keen interest in the unexplained powers of the human mind.

        "0061727660": "Alexander McCall Smith Talks with Jacqueline WinspearAlexander McCall Smith: Characters, once created, have a way of staying on. Maisie is an attractive character--when did she say to you: \"I want a series?\"Jacqueline Winspear: As I was writing the first novel in the series,Maisie Dobbs, I realized that scenes and ideas were coming to me that were not part of the book. I started keeping notes on those other scenes, passages of dialogue and so on, and when I had finishedMaisie Dobbs, I went through those notes and realized I had rough plans for another five or six books. Indeed, as I was writing the second book in the series,Birds of a Feather, I really had to push any thoughts of the intended third novel from my mind, so strong were the images forPardonable Liesthat kept popping into my mind's eye. I had to be very disciplined not to be distracted by those images--it was rather like being nagged by one's own characters.&nbsp;Smith: Maisie Dobbs is firmly placed in the past. Would you be comfortable writing about contemporary Britain?Winspear: That&rsquo;s a very good question, and indeed, I have a more contemporary novel on the proverbial \"back-burner.\"&nbsp; However, although I visit my parents in Sussex many several times each year, for me there is a certain detachment from everyday life in the UK. I am not as familiar with various aspects of life there, so it might be difficult to get that ring of authenticity.&nbsp; On the other hand, one could argue that the lack of transparency could act in my favor, because I now take notice of so many things that might have passed me by.&nbsp; I believe one of the reasons I am so comfortable writing about the past is that when I was a child we lived in a small hamlet with very few children, so it was a world of adults, many of them elderly, and all of them ready to tell a story of their own youth.I have always been drawn to the past through family history, a curiosity that has its roots in my grandfather's experience in the Great War--he was wounded and shell-shocked at the Battle of the Somme in 1916. Even as a very young child I understood the extent of his suffering and struggled to fathom how something so terrible could happen to a beloved grandparent.&nbsp; And I am sure my interest in the women of that generation--the first generation of women to go to war in modern times--is rooted in memories of the ladies of a certain age who lived in our neighborhood as I was growing up. They were typical of that generation, very independent women who had remained single due to circumstance, for the men they might have married had been lost to war.So, to the question of writing about contemporary Britain--I think I'll find out more about my level of comfort with modern times when I pull that contemporary novel off the back burner. In the meantime, there's so much that I want to explore from the past, though when I immerse myself in the preparatory research for my books, I am always reminded of the old adage: \"history repeats itself.\"Smith: You and I both started as novelists rather later than is perhaps usual. Is that a good thing or a bad thing?Winspear: When I was sixteen I rather precociously announced that I would write my first novel by the time I was thirty--it seemed such a formidable age of adulthood, I suppose. Of course, thirty came and went with no novel to show for it, and in the meantime I was becoming more and more interested in nonfiction writing.&nbsp; I was in my late thirties by the time I made a real commitment to getting my work published, and I concentrated more on essays, articles and other creative nonfiction. I believe my writing at that time represented something of an apprenticeship in that I was really working at the craft of writing, of building my understanding of framing a scene, of bringing the reader along with metaphor, and with developing scenes that were something like the literary equivalent of a zoom lens on the camera; I was trying to find out what worked in terms of drawing the reader in and placing them at the center of the action. Though I had no plans to write a novel until the idea forMaisie Dobbsactually came to me, upon reflection it seems as if I had been preparing for the task with my literary cross-training in the same way that an athlete prepares for the big event.&nbsp;I believe the journey to becoming a writer is one that is very personal to the individual and is neither good or bad--it's just what it is. There are times when I think it would have been so much more fun to have started writing fiction earlier, but had that happened, the stars might not have aligned to bring the character of Maisie Dobbs into my life.&nbsp; And I think that in embarking upon being novelists in our middle years, we&rsquo;ve probably both brought something to our work that we might not have been able to offer in younger days, either due to other responsibilities, or simply who we were at the time (though having said that, I am sure your readers wish the wonderful Precious Ramotswe had been created many years before you decided to writeThe No 1 Ladies' Detective Agency!)Smith: Have you written anything about Maisie that you would like to unwrite?Winspear: No, not at all, although I should add that I have never gone back and re-read any of my books, a prospect I find rather daunting.&nbsp; Of course, I dip back into the books to check a point here and there, but I have never read the books from beginning to end--if I had done so, I might have a whole list of things that cause me to shudder.Smith: Do you think that transplanting oneself--in your case from the UK to California--helps one as a writer?Winspear: Another very good question!&nbsp; Many years ago, during a visit to New York, I went along to an exhibit at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue--it was called \"Writers in Exile.\"&nbsp; The focus was on writers who lived in a place other than the land of their birth, \"by will, or by compunction.\" I spent ages going around the exhibit taking copious notes, and remember it left me with a real sense of the power of being transplanted, whether by one&rsquo;s own choice, or by circumstance; and I have to say, I often think of it when people ask me if being here in California contributes to my work as a writer--and it does. To give an example, I can immerse myself in the time and place about which I write--Britain from the Great War on up to the 1930s--and I am not distracted by British life as it is today. Yes, of course, there is contemporary life here in California, but it is different (the way people speak, interact, shop, travel, work, etc.) so I can draw a firm line between life here and the world about which I write.&nbsp; I should confess that one of my recent challenges came when I started writingThe Mapping of Love and Death. The opening is set in California in 1914, so I had to ensure that my knowledge of that region today did not seep into the story. To that end I immersed myself in old books about the region, and managed to procure some vintage photographs to pin on the wall so that the past was very much with me as I wrote.When I write, the time and place of my imagination becomes very distilled, very sharp in my mind's eye. In terms of the series featuring Maisie Dobbs, it has definitely helped to be living here; when I sit down at my desk to write, I step from my world into her world, and I&rsquo;m aware of nothing else until I stop writing.&nbsp; And when I drag myself back from a morning spent in the smog-enveloped London of the 1930s, it's not bad to be able to walk outside into the garden and warm my bones in the California sun for a while.",

        "0060923245": "Atom Egoyan's Oscar-nominatedThe Sweet Hereafteris a good movie, remarkably faithful to the spirit of Russell Banks's novel of the same name, but Banks's book is twice as good. With the cool logic of accreting snowflakes, his prose builds a world--a small U.S. town near Canada--and peoples it with four vivid, sensitive souls linked by a school-bus tragedy: the bus driver; the widowed Vietnam vet who was driving behind the bus, waving at his kids, when it went off the road; the perpetually peeved negligence lawyer who tries to shape the victims' heartaches into a winning case; and the beauty-queen cheerleader crippled by the crash, whose testimony will determine everyone's fate.We experience the story from inside the heads of the four characters in turn--each knowing things the others don't, each misunderstanding the facts in his or her own way. The method resembles Faulkner'sThe Sound and the FuryandGilbert Sorrentino's stunningAberration of Starlight, but Banks's achievement is most comparable toJohn Updike's tales of ordinary small-towners preternaturally gifted with slangy eloquence, psychological insights, and alertness to life's tiniest details.Egoyan's film is haunting but vague--it leaves viewers in the dark regarding several critical plot points. Banks's book is more haunting still, and precise, making every revelation count, with a finale far superior to that of the film. It's also wittier than the too-sober flick: the lawyer dismisses the dome-dwelling hippie parents of one of the crash victims as being \"lost in their Zen Little Indians fantasy,\" which casts a sharp light on them and him, too. He's lost in his calculations of how each parent will fit into the legal system, and the ways in which he fits into the tragedy are lost on him. If only he and the Vietnam-vet dad could read each other's account of their tense first encounter, both of them might get what the other is missing.Banks's wit is pitiless--it's painful when we discover that the bus driver, who prides herself on interpreting for her stroke-impaired husband, is translating his wise but garbled observations all wrong. The crash turns out not to be the ultimate tragedy: in the cold northern light of its aftermath, we discover that we're all in this alone.",

        "0062241796": "Veteran journalist Johnston combines her powerful personal story with strong reporting to show that alcohol harms women even more than men. She grew up with a mother who was an alcoholic and a father who became one in retirement, and she wound up in rehab herself. Johnston includes many examples of alcohol wreaking havoc on women&#x2019;s lives, including a mom driving drunk who crashes and kills her child passengers, and a high-school class president and prom queen who died of alcohol poisoning. Women are more likely than men to binge drink, which increases their risk of breast cancer, heart disease, and sexually transmitted diseases. Johnston convincingly argues that alcohol is the new tobacco,  and, as such, needs a similar public-health response. Just as Virginia Slims boosted cigarettes&#x2019; appeal to women, products such as Bethenny Frankel&#x2019;s Skinnygirl Cocktails and Fergie&#x2019;s low-calorie, fruit-flavored vodka&#x2014;Voli&#x2014;make booze seem alluring.

        "0060838744": "It has been said that one can see farther only by standing on  the shoulders of giants.Ahab's Wife, Sena Naslund's epic work of historical fiction, honors that aphorism, using Herman Melville'sMoby-Dickas looking glass into early-19th-century America.  Through  the eye of an outsider, a woman, she suggests that New England life was broader  and richer than Melville's manly world of men, ships, and whales. This ambitious novel pays tribute to Melville, creating heroines from his  lesser characters, and to America's literary heritage in general.Una, named for the heroine of Edmund Spenser'sFaerie Queene, flees to the New England coast from Kentucky to escape  her father's puritanism and to pursue a more exalted life. She gets whaling out of her system early:  going to sea at 16 disguised as a boy, Una  has her ship sunk by her own monstrous whale, and survives a harrowing shipwreck:I was so horrified by the whale's deliberate charge that I could not move.  Then my own name flew up from below like a spear: \"Una!\"  Giles' voice broke my trance, and I scrambled down the rigging.  No sooner did my foot touch the deck than there was such a lurch that I fell to my face.  I heard and felt the boards break below the waterline, the copper sheathing nothing but decorative foil.  The whole ship shuddered.  A death throe.The ship dies, but Una returns to land to pursue the life of the mind. The novel's opening line--\"Captain Ahab was neither my first husband  nor my last\"--also diminishes Melville's hero in the broader scheme of things. Naslund exposes the reader to the unsung, real-life heroes of Melville's world, including Margaret Fuller and her Boston salon, and Nantucket astronomer Maria Mitchell.  There is a chance meeting with a veiled Nathaniel Hawthorne in the woods, and throughout the novel the  story brims with references to the giants of literature: Shakespeare, Goethe, Coleridge, Keats, and Wordsworth.  Although her novel runs long at  nearly 700 pages, Naslund has created an imaginative, entertaining, and very impressive work.--Ted Leventhal--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

There are billions of dollars in advertising  moving online, waiting to be claimed by whoever can build the best content and communities.  Despite this change, most people keep working at jobs that don&rsquo;t make them happy and  businesses continue to ignore the major marketing and public relations benefits that can be  found online.Myth #1:I&rsquo;m not passionate about something sexy or popular like  wine so these lessons don&rsquo;t apply to me.The internet has drastically decreased the costs of building communities around niche  subjects, allowing for even the most obscure subjects to draw enough eyeballs to command  advertising attention. Starting a video blog about tortilla chips may seem farfetched until  Doritos gives you a call and offers 40,000 a year to sponsor and advertise on your blog.Myth #2:My business already has a Twitter account and a Facebook page,  we&rsquo;re set in the social media department.This is the equivalent of claiming twenty years ago that just because your business bought a  TV spot and a few ads in the newspaper, you didn&rsquo;t need to pay attention to your  advertising department. Social media isn&rsquo;t about joining in, it&rsquo;s about being  involved.Myth #3:I&rsquo;m happy at my job so this book is irrelevant to  me.First of all, congratulations on finding work that makes you happy! However, the lessons in  this book are valuable to anyone, regardless of their employment status.Crush Itwill  show you how to utilize high level and platform specific social media and marketing strategies  that will improve your work.

While you may have to  fall behind on the current season of Lost or let your Madden 2010 game suffer, because  you&rsquo;ll be doing something you love you won&rsquo;t mind putting in the extra effort.InCrush It, Gary Vaynerchuk shows how anyone can build a career around what  they&rsquo;re passionate about. He also delivers both high-level and platform specific strategy  and analysis, allowing you to take advantage of the current business environment while preparing  you to succeed as it changes and evolves.This book isn&rsquo;t interested in making unrealistic promises while glossing over the work  involved. Making a living by building content around your passion isn&rsquo;t simple and it  doesn&rsquo;t happen overnight. What it is, however, is fulfilling and in most cases just as  profitable, if not more so, than your previous job.Furthermore, a business can&rsquo;t just pay lip service to social media and expect it to  return results. The transparency and accountability inherent in its structure necessitates a  comprehensive and dedicated strategy in order to reap its tremendous benefits.By combining practical analysis and strategy with the same passion and humor that&rsquo;s  made Gary one of the most in demand keynote speakers in the U.S. as well as network  television&rsquo;s go to wine expert,Crush Itis essential reading for anyone who  wants to understand and harness the future of business and work.Learn:Why social media has evened the playing field, destroying the  &ldquo;gate-keepers&rdquo; who had previously dictated the distribution of content.Learn:How to beat unemployment and create wealth-building opportunities by  building and maintaining a personal brand.Learn:Why storytelling is the most important business concept in the  current marketplace.Learn:How you can build an online business around your passion without  quitting your day job.Learn:Why Twitter and Facebook are just tools and not a social media  strategy.Learn:How to take advantage of the half-billion dollars in advertising that  are moving to the internet.Learn:Why transparency and being true to yourself are now winning marketing  formulas.Learn:How to build and maintain an online community around your passion and  brand.Learn:Strategies for turning attention into money.Learn:Why the legacy element of the internet era is so underrated.",

        "B00004U5VF": "The Tekken series has always stood as a set of console games that went above and beyond their arcade counterparts.  From additional characters to completely new modes, the series has always tried to add something that the arcade games lacked.  Tekken Tag Tournament, at first glance, is the most dramatic upgrade over an arcade Tekken game to date. The graphics have been given a huge boost, similar to the upgrade that Namco's weapon-based fighter, Soul Calibur, received when it hit the Dreamcast last year. Plus, new modes have been added. But does the series capture the same magical feeling that made the previous Tekken games such smash hits? Most definitely.Tekken Tag Tournament serves as an upgrade to Tekken 3, adding a few new moves along the way. Fighters that had appeared in Tekken 2 but were missing from Tekken 3 have been brought back as well, and most of them have lots of new moves to help balance them with the more powerful Tekken 3 fighters. Finally, the game is now fought in the same tag-team style as Capcom's versus series of fighters, so you can switch between two different characters at any time. Much like Street Fighter EX3 and Dead or Alive 2, you can have up to four players, with each player controlling a different fighter in the tag battle. However, unlike most other tag-battle fighters, Tekken Tag rounds end after only one of the two fighters have been defeated, rather than letting the battle continue as a one-on-two affair. An option that let you configure this would have been nice. Aside from the standard tag-battle arcade mode, there is also a one-on-one game that makes Tekken Tag Tournament more like the previous Tekken games, as well as the standard team battle (though it is now a tag-team battle), time attack, and survival modes. Unlockable modes include a theater mode, where you can watch all of the game's endings; a gallery mode, which lets you pause the game at any time and snap a screenshot of the action that is saved to your memory card for later viewing; and Tekken bowl mode, a bowling minigame that lets you hit the lanes and toss glimmer globes at Heihachi-headed bowling pins. Each character has a different bowling style that affects speed and control. The character endings, with the exception of the game's final boss, are rendered using the game engine. This presumably saved time during the game's development. As a result, they're short, mostly meaningless, and decidedly less than impressive.  By comparison, the prerendered intro and the final boss' prerendered ending are simply incredible pieces of footage. In Japan, the TV commercial for the game is simply an abridged version of the game's new intro movie. Very striking stuff.Graphically, the game has taken a very large leap, and the arcade version of the game looks downright ugly by comparison.  The characters are very, very smooth, and the backgrounds are amazing and filled with lots of movement, from helicopters to crowds of spectators. Some stages are well lit, showing off some really excellent lens-flare techniques. There are also some nice little touches, such as grass being crushed down by falling fighters then slowly springing up afterward. However, the game suffers from one particular problem that has in fact been seen throughout the series, but with the power of the PlayStation2 behind it, you'd expect it to be a thing of the past. The problem is the same one that showed up in Street Fighter EX3. While the backdrops of the fights and the ground on which you fight look great separately, they don't mesh very well. The result is two different types of scrolling, making it look as if the battle is occurring on a small, circular spinning platform surrounded by a nearly stationary background. It's easy to miss while you're actually playing, but it sticks out like a sore thumb on watching the game closely. Also, the game uses much of the same animation and motion-capture data from Tekken 3. Sure, the characters look pretty incredible, but with the identical animation quality, even as good as that animation was, the game looks and feels a little on the stale side. The soundtrack is full of techno and vocoder robot voices that will either endear you to the soundtrack or drive you up the wall.How much you enjoy the game will directly relate to one factor: If you played so much Tekken 2 and 3 that you couldn't possibly play another match, Tekken Tag doesn't offer enough new features to draw you back in. But if you've stayed away from the Tekken series for a long time, Tekken Tag is a very warm homecoming, delivering the same solid gameplay that Tekken fans crave in large doses. Still, you won't be able to stop yourself from wondering what Namco could have done with the game if it had been designed on the PS2 (or comparable arcade hardware) from the start. Guess we'll all have to wait for Tekken 4 to find that out.--Jeff Gerstmann--Copyright &#169; 2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

        "0060580674": "If he weren't such a good action writer, Rollins might make a dynamite climatologist. Each of his thrillers has featured as a central character an extreme environment, most recently the Arctic ice (Ice Hunt, 2003) and now the hot sands of Saudi Arabia. But while Rollins writes settings and scenes that sizzle, what's caught in the heat are usually familiar characters grappling with far-fetched threats, and so it is here. That one male lead is a danger-courting archeologist named Omaha Dunn seems less parodic than tired, and the novel's premise of a hoard of antimatter hidden in the legendary city of Ubar is almost as ridiculous as the idea that this cache has been guarded for millennia by an order of women who propagate without men, via parthenogenesis. Rollins writes less like Michael Crichton than Stan Lee. Most of his readers won't care, though, because there's just enough scientific gloss on the nonsense to make it palatable, and anyway, what they want, and what he delivers, is action, as Omaha and an American military agent, Painter, join forces with two Mideastern women, one a scientist, the other a billionaire, to locate the steadily destabilizing antimatter before it's snatched by a villainous cabal, or worse, blows up the planet.

On July 5, 2011, nearly three years after her initial arrest, Casey Anthony walked away, virtually scot-free, from one of the most sensational murder trials of all time. She'd been accused of killing her daughter, Caylee, but the trial only left behind more questions: Was she actually innocent? What really happened to Caylee? Was this what justice really looked like?InImperfect Justice, prosecutor Jeff Ashton, one of the principal players in the case's drama, sheds light on those questions and much more, telling the behind-the-scenes story of the investigation, the trial, and the now-infamous verdict. Providing an inside account of the case, Ashton, a career prosecutor for the state of Florida, goes where the press and pundits have only speculated, detailing what really happened during the investigation, showing how the prosecution built their case, and explaining how a woman so shrouded in suspicion was proclaimed innocent.Moving beyond the simple explanations, Ashton offers an in-depth look at the complex figure of Casey Anthony, a woman whose lies he spent three years trying to understand.

But was Steve really the lookout who gave the \"all clear\" to the murderer, or was he just in the wrong place at the wrong time? In this innovative novel by Walter Dean Myers, the reader becomes both juror and witness during the trial of Steve's life. To calm his nerves as he sits in the courtroom, aspiring filmmaker Steve chronicles the proceedings in movie script format.  Interspersed throughout his screenplay are journal writings that provide insight into Steve's life before the murder and his feelings about being held in prison during the trial. \"They take away your shoelaces and your belt so you can't kill yourself no matter how bad it is. I guess making you live is part of the punishment.\"Myers, known for the inner-city classicMotown and Didi(first  published in 1984), proves withMonsterthat he has kept up with both the struggles and the lingo of today's teens. Steve is an adolescent caught up in the violent circumstances of an adult world--a situation most teens can relate to on some level. Readers will no doubt  be attracted to the novel's handwriting-style typeface, emphasis on dialogue, and fast-paced courtroom action. By weaving together Steve's journal entries and his script, Myers has given the first-person voice a new twist and added yet another worthy volume to his already admirable body of work.

Truly, fiction could not write betrayal, resistance, collaboration, or celebration with more robustness or with a more alluring who&#x2019;s-who of writers, artists, and military powers than history did in this single hotel.

Violet, Klaus, and Sunny find themselves tossed in a storm so terrible that our beloved narrator spends four pages describing how he cannot describe it. From this point on, fans of the series' smarty-pants wordplay and acrobatic narrative can rest assured that they're in for more of the same (and how) in this 368-page finale, and Daniel Handler's deadpan Snicket continues to tutor a generation in self-referential humor (including one particularly funny bit regarding three very short men carrying a large, flat piece of wood, painted to look like a living room). Snicket notes, of course, that if you read the entire series, \"your only reward will be 170 chapters of misery in your library and countless tears in your eyes.\"There's one big question, though, for anyone who's made it through \"the thirteenth chapter of the thirteenth volume in this sad history\": is the final book a fitting end? That question is probably best-answered by one ofThe End's most oft-repeated phrases: It depends on how you look at it. Those looking for conclusive resolution to the series' many, many mysteries may be disappointed, although some big questions do get explicit answers. Not surprisingly for a work so deliberately labyrinthine, though, even the absence of an answer can be sort of an answer--and reaction toThe Endcan be something of a Rorschach test for readers.

But if his cyberpunk classic was big,Cryptonomiconis huge... gargantuan... massive, not just in size (a hefty 918 pages including appendices) but in scope and appeal. It's the hip, readable heir toGravity's Rainbowandthe Illuminatus trilogy. And it's only the first of a proposed series--for more information, readour interview with Stephenson.Cryptonomiconzooms all over the world, careening conspiratorially back and forth between two time periods--World War II and the present. Our 1940s heroes are the brilliant mathematician Lawrence Waterhouse, cryptanalyst extraordinaire, and gung ho, morphine-addicted marine Bobby Shaftoe. They're part of Detachment 2702, an Allied group trying to break Axis communication codes while simultaneously preventing the enemy from figuring out that their codes have been broken. Their job boils down to layer upon layer of deception. Dr. Alan Turing is also a member of 2702, and he explains the unit's strange workings to Waterhouse. \"When we want to sink a convoy, we send out an observation plane first.... Of course, to observe is not itsrealduty--we already know exactly where the convoy is. Itsrealduty isto be observed.... Then, when we come round and sink them, the Germans will not find it suspicious.\"All of this secrecy resonates in the present-day story line, in which the grandchildren of the WWII heroes--inimitable programming geek Randy Waterhouse and the lovely and powerful Amy Shaftoe--team up to help create an offshore data haven in Southeast Asia and maybe uncover some gold once destined for Nazi coffers. To top off the paranoiac tone of the book, the mysterious Enoch Root, key member of Detachment 2702 and theSocietas Eruditorum, pops up with an unbreakable encryption scheme left over from WWII to befuddle the 1990s protagonists with conspiratorial ties.Cryptonomiconis vintage Stephenson from start to finish: short on plot, but long on detail so precise it's exhausting. Every page has a math problem, a quotable in-joke, an amazing idea, or a bit of sharp prose.Cryptonomiconis also packed with truly weird characters, funky tech, and crypto--all the crypto you'll ever need, in fact, not to mention all the computer jargon of the moment. A word to the wise: if you read this book in one sitting, you may die of information overload (and starvation).--Therese Littleton--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

They can then watch your performance, modify it to their liking and send their jam videos back to you.Tutes: Your Own Private Back-up BandWhen not playing with friends, you can invite jam masters known as Tutes to play with you. They'll join a session playing an instrument that each thinks is strong for a specific song. You can simply enjoy the musical camaraderie, or pick up instrument tips by watching them jam.

In 922 A.D, Ibn Fadlan, a devout Muslim, left his home in Baghdad on a mission to the King of Saqaliba. During his journey, he meets various groups of &quot;barbarians&quot; who have poor hygiene and gorge themselves on food, alcohol and sex.

He witnesses everything from group orgies to violent funeral ceremonies. Despite the language and cultural barriers, Ibn Fadlan is welcomed into the clan. The leader of the group, Buliwyf (who can communicate in Latin) takes Fadlan under his wing.Without warning, the chieftain is ordered to haul his warriors back to Scandinavia to save his people from the &quot;monsters of the mist.&quot; Ibn Fadlan follows the clan and must rise to the occasion in the battle of his life.--Gina Kaysen--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

After graduating from the University of Alabama with a degree in English and Creative Writing, she moved to New York City, where she worked in magazine publishing and marketing for nine years.The Helpis her first novel.Kathryn Stockett:This is by far your most epic novel to date.  How long did it take you to writeThe Shoemaker&rsquo;s Wife?Adriana Trigiani:I worked on this story for over 20 years as I wrote scripts and novels and had my own family. There are scraps of paper, dinner napkins, and bills with timelines and notes scrawled across them. There are old notebooks filled with my grandmother&rsquo;s musings from 1985. I collected train tickets, copies of ships&rsquo; manifests, and a silk tag with my grandmother&rsquo;s name from garments she had created. I traveled as far as the Italian Alps and as close as the few blocks it takes me to walk to Little Italy in New York City to capture the historical aspects of the story. All of this went into the novel. It was a delicious gestation period.Stockett:This is a novel, but it is inspired by a true story&mdash;a family story, right?Trigiani:Yes&mdash;my grandparents, Lucia and Carlo. Their love was a dance with fate. It is riddled with near misses against a landscape of such massive world events that it&rsquo;s a wonder they got together atall. My challenge was to present their world to the reader so it might feel it was happening in the moment. I wanted the reader to have the experience I had when stories were told to me by the woman who lived them.Stockett:The novel takes place during the first half of the twentieth century--what is so compelling about this period of time to you?Trigiani:The cusp of the twentieth century was a time everything was new&mdash;cars, phones, planes, electricity, even sportswear, and in each innovation was a kind of explosive potential. No one could predict where all the inventions would lead, people only knew that change was unavoidable.My grandparents were delighted every time America presented them with something they had never seen before. And my grandparents&rsquo; sense of wonder never left them, so I tried not to let it leave the page, be it a cross-country train ride or the first snap of the bobbin on an electric Singer sewing machine.Stockett:Through the remarkable story of Enza and Ciro, your novel tells the larger story of the immigrant experience in America.Trigiani:What a gift immigrants were and are to this country! They bring their talents and loyalty and make our country even greater. My grandparents were proud to be new Americans. Assimilation was not about copying an American ideal, but aspiring to their own version of it. The highest compliment you could pay a fellow immigrant was: he (or she) was ahard worker. I hear the phrasework like an immigrantsaid, but really, it&rsquo;s bigger than that&mdash;we must alsodream like immigrants.Stockett:The Shoemaker&rsquo;s Wifeseamlessly brings together fictional characters and historical figures&mdash;how did the wonderful Caruso enter the novel?Trigiani:It started with a three-foot stack of vinyl records&mdash;my grandmother Lucia&rsquo;s collection of Caruso. Her absolute devotion to The Great Voice lasted her whole life long. I knew, in order to write this novel, I had to fall in love with Caruso too, because he sang the score of my grandparents&rsquo; love affair.When Lucia passed, I went to my first opera, seeking understanding and comfort. As the music washed over me, I began to understand why my grandmother was such a fan. The words were Italian, and the emotions were big; nothing was left unexpressed in the music.

There, he developed a virulent opportunistic infection and died just one week later. Suddenly and unexpectedly alone, Oates staggered through her days and nights trying desperately just to survive Smith's death and the terrifying loneliness that his death brought. In her typically probing fashion, Oates navigates her way through the choppy waters of widowhood, at first refusing to accept her new identity as a widow. She wonders if there is a perspective from which the widow's grief is sheer vanity, this pretense that one's loss is so very special that there has never been a loss quite like it. In the end, Oates finds meaning, much like many of Tolstoy's characters, in the small acts that make up and sustain ordinary life. When she finds an earring she thought she'd lost in a garbage can that raccoons have overturned, she reflects, \"If I have lost the meaning of my life, and the love of my life, I might still find small treasured things amid the spilled and pilfered trash.\" At times overly self-conscious, Oates nevertheless shines a bright light in every corner in her soul-searing memoir of widowhood.

As the narrator of this audio edition, Knox sounds authentic, sincere, and vulnerable. In early portions of the narrative related to the crime scene and arrest, her emotions are muted, conveying the same deer-in-the-headlights reaction for which she was skewered in media coverage at the time. Yet, while recounting her experiences in prison after being convicted, when she grasped the gravity of the situation, Knox conveys her sense of desperation during a process in which the cards seemed hopelessly stacked against her. Her conversations with a sympathetic prison chaplain and with her deeply loyal family and close friends are especially moving. In her recitation of legal details, Knox falls into occasional lapses in pronunciation, but given the weight of the personal aspects of her performance, these flaws prove minor and don't detract from the listening experience.

For years, English archer Thomas of Hookton has been searching for the Holy Grail. Thomas is not certain it ever existed, but obscure clues link his family to the mysterious vessel. In 1347, driven by his desire to plumb the truth of the Grail as well as to earn money from the plunder of French lands and property, Thomas and a small group of soldiers capture a castle in Gascony, the homeland of Thomas's father. Thomas hopes to hold the castle against the French, raid the countryside for loot and draw the attention of his evil cousin Guy Vexille, a French nobleman who murdered Thomas's father and who may have information about the Grail. Vexille appears, but so does the army of a local lord, sent to besiege the castle, and the vicious brother of a treacherous and cunning bishop who is determined to secure the Grail. Fighting honorably amid extreme brutality, Thomas is aided by loyal English archers, English and French men-at-arms, local bandits, a Scottish mercenary and a heretic girl with unusual powers. Outnumbered by his enemies, he faces the might of a huge cannon and the power of the Church's greed-not to mention the dreaded Black Death.

Are they causing the trouble with the dead, or are they simply patsies? And, more importantly, why is everyone associated with her brother dying in such a dramatic way? Eleanor is strong willed and inquiring, and the situations mirror the Victorian sensibilities well. Give this novel to anyone who likes a light zombie story with a pinch of romance.-Saleena L.

Their job: investigate the disappearance of a multiple murderess from a locked room. Tom Stechschulte's rendition of the endlessly shifting story line is a tour de force. He begins by capturing the easygoing male bonding of the two lawmen and slowly adds a harder edge to the narration as they meet the odd people in charge of the facility and encounter an assortment of increasingly disturbing events. Even if listeners may be disappointed with Lehane's somewhat predictable conclusion, Stechschulte's delivery&mdash;shot through with pain and rage&mdash;ensures that they will not forget it.A Morrow hardcover.

        "0060883529": "Product DescriptionJane Leavy, the acclaimed author of theNew York TimesbestsellerSandy Koufax: A Lefty's Legacy, returns with a biography of an American original&mdash;number 7, Mickey Mantle. Drawing on more than 500 interviews with friends and family, teammates, and opponents, she delivers the definitive account of Mantle's life, mining the mythology of The Mick for the true story of a luminous and illustrious talent with an achingly damaged soul.Meticulously reported and elegantly written,The Last Boyis a baseball tapestry that weaves together episodes from the author's weekend with The Mick in Atlantic City, where she interviewed her hero in 1983, after he was banned from baseball, with reminiscences from friends and family of the boy from Commerce, Oklahoma, who would lead the Yankees to seven world championships, be voted the American League's Most Valuable Player three times, win the Triple Crown in 1956, and duel teammate Roger Maris for Babe Ruth's home run crown in the summer of 1961&mdash;the same boy who would never grow up.As she did so memorably in her biography of Sandy Koufax, Jane Leavy transcends the hyperbole of hero worship to reveal the man behind the coast-to-coast smile, who grappled with a wrenching childhood, crippling injuries, and a genetic predisposition to alcoholism. InThe Last Boyshe chronicles her search to find out more about the person he was and, given what she discovers, to explain his mystifying hold on a generation of baseball fans, who were seduced by that lopsided, gap-toothed grin. It is an uncommon biography, with literary overtones: not only a portrait of an icon, but an investigation of memory itself. How long was the Tape Measure Home Run? Did Mantle swing the same way right-handed and left-handed? What really happened to his knee in the 1951 World Series? What happened to the red-haired, freckle-faced boy known back home as Mickey Charles?\"I believe in memory, not memorabilia,\" Leavy writes in her preface. But inThe Last Boy, she discovers that what we remember of our heroes&mdash;and even what they remember of themselves&mdash;is only where the story begins.Amazon Q&amp;A: Bill Madden Interviews Jane LeavyFor more than 30 yearsBill Maddenhas covered the Yankees and Major League Baseball for theNew York Daily News. The author of several books about the Yankees, includingSteinbrenner: The Last Lion of Baseball, Madden is also the 2010 recipient of the Baseball Hall of Fame's J.G. Taylor Spink Award.Madden:Your best-selling biography of Sandy Koufax was a tour de force, partly because Koufax was a very private man whose life story had never really been told before. Mickey Mantle&rsquo;s life is quite the opposite, it&rsquo;s been in the subject of a spate of different &ldquo;autobiographies,&rdquo; some of which he even wrote. Under those circumstances, what made you want to take up another book about him?Leavy:Originally, I wanted to write about Willie, Mickey and The Duke in New York in the Fifties. The publisher said, &ldquo;Do The Mick. Everybody loves The Mick.&rdquo; I was wary because so much had been written about him&mdash;he left a paper trail as long as the drive from Commerce, Oklahoma to the Bronx, so I didn&rsquo;t expect to learn that he&rsquo;d been raised by a den of Alaskan she-wolves. My challenge was to strip away all the layers of myth that had accumulated and let Mickey breathe. And he, of all people, was my worst source. For example: the knee surgery he said he had after tripping over a drain in the 1951 World Series trying not to run into Joe DiMaggio in centerfield. In fact, he didn&rsquo;t have surgery until two years later. I only learned that because I went through every day of theNew York Timesfrom October 1951 to November 1953 looking for the date the knife fell! That&rsquo;s why this book took five years and nearly 600 interviews. I wanted to try to understand why after all these years, and all these revelations, Mickey Mantle still means so much to so many people&mdash;including me&mdash;and the first step was to get the basic facts straight.Madden:You make the point early on in the book that Mickey was a childhood hero, but you also have a recurring sequence in the book of your first interview with him in Atlantic City in 1983, where&mdash;at one point&mdash;he drunkenly makes a pass at you. What lingering effect did this have on how you ultimately approached your book?Leavy:I was plenty nervous when I met him. Mickey was my hero. But, he was also a very particular kind of role model. I was born two months prematurely (in a hospital a mile from Yankee Stadium) and came with some of the flaws that afflict those who don&rsquo;t incubate as long as we&rsquo;re supposed to. Mickey taught me how to function with pain and without complaint&mdash;his triumphs were mine. I was devastated with how he acted. After I&rsquo;d taken his hand from my knee, I called the only person I could think of still awake at that hour, a new mother, who basically told me to grow up.The next morning, over breakfast, I vented my anger and disappointment, railing at him for, among other things, greeting my youthful autograph request with flatulence. He was stunned and remorseful, albeit in a hilariously idiosyncratic manner. He gave me an 8 x 10 glossy that said, &ldquo;Sorry, I farted, your friend, Mick.&rdquo; For a moment, I felt I saw behind his crude fa&ccedil;ade. I decided the only way I could write this book was to acknowledge my lack of dispassion and scrutinize him completely. That&rsquo;s what happened that weekend in Atlantic City. It forced me to see the world as it was, not how I wanted it to be.Madden:One of the people I wish I'd been able to interview for my Steinbrenner book was Mantle, if only because I detected a very strained relationship between the two of them. Steinbrenner made a point to deify DiMaggio and had memorial services for Joe, Billy Martin, Roger Maris and Mel Allen, but did nothing for Mickey when he died. In your conversations with Mickey did he ever talk about Steinbrenner and anything that might have led to ill feelings toward each other?Leavy:When I told Mantle I&rsquo;d heard the Boss was thinking of turning Monument Park in centerfield into a water park for the disadvantaged youth of the South Bronx, Mantle was completely incredulous. He told me, &ldquo;It was 480 in centerfield when I played. It&rsquo;s 420 now and he&rsquo;s talking about bringing them in farther,&rdquo; and shook his head. &ldquo;I was at a banquet one time and I said to him, &lsquo;they ought to let those boys throw the ball up and hit it.&rsquo; That pissed him off.&rdquo;Mantle was interested in Yankee history&mdash;he grilled a friend who saw Babe Ruth lying in state in the rotunda at the Stadium about what it was like to be there that day. But I don&rsquo;t think he had a whole lot of patience with &ldquo;Yankeeography.&rdquo; It was a quick disillusionment. When he signed with the Yankees, reporters asked which Yankee had been his childhood hero. He said, &ldquo;Stan Musial.&rdquo; George Weiss, the general manager, immediately &ldquo;corrected&rdquo; his memory and from then on Joe D. was his hero. Furthermore, I think he was deeply disappointed with the baseball community&rsquo;s response&mdash;or lack of response&mdash;when commissioner Bowie Kuhn banned him in 1983 because of his affiliation with the Claridge Hotel and Casino, a job he had taken to pay for his son Billy&rsquo;s treatment for non-Hodgkin&rsquo;s Lymphoma. He told me, &ldquo;I feel really kind of bad no one took up for me.&rdquo; By &ldquo;no one&rdquo; I was pretty sure he meant Steinbrenner. The Yankees did little more than observe a moment of silence when Mantle died.Madden:It would seem that most everybody pertinent to the book cooperated with you, especially the Mantle family. I was grateful for the cooperation I had from George Steinbrenner&rsquo;s friends and associates when I wroteSteinbrenner, but I had an advantage that you didn&rsquo;t in that most of them knew me personally and, I suppose, trusted me. As a stranger, did you meet any significant resistance?Leavy:Danny and David Mantle&mdash;Mickey&rsquo;s sons&mdash;and their late mother, Merlyn&mdash;were extremely generous with their recollections and insights. Their openness about their lives and their relationship with their father was extraordinary. Like him, they are extremely honest. There&rsquo;s no put on, as folks in Commerce, Oklahoma like to say. I hope they&rsquo;ll come away from the book with a deeper understanding of the forces that formed him and contributed to his downfall, but I don&rsquo;t know how they&rsquo;ll react.Madden:This is the definitive &ldquo;warts and all&rdquo; biography of Mickey, with heavy emphasis on all of his demons. How do you think Mickey himself would feel about the book?Leavy:I think it&rsquo;s an honest book and Mantle was a very honest man. I don&rsquo;t see this is as a dark book. I hope it&rsquo;s enlightening in the most literal sense of the word and I hope that critics&mdash;and readers at large&mdash;will agree. I think the tragedy of Mantle is that he had so little time, at the beginning of his baseball career, and at the beginning of his sober life, to be his best self. He was a decent man who was genetically pre-disposed to alcoholism and enabled his whole life by the trappings of his celebrity. That&rsquo;s his story. As Billy Crystal told me about his movie,61*, Mickey wouldn&rsquo;t have wanted the sugar coat.His late wife, Merlyn, wrote about the sexual abuse he suffered as a young boy in the family memoir, &ldquo;A Hero All His Life&rdquo; and she elaborated on it when we spoke, as did several of his close friends. It turned out that his half sister wasn&rsquo;t his only abuser and experts tell me that many of the destructive behaviors he manifested are seen in victims of childhood sexual abuse. So, I came away with enormous compassion for him and, I hope, with an answer to the question posed by one of his minor league teammates: &ldquo;Mickey, what happened?&rdquo;",
        "006039322X": "Director Hitchcock is in a class by himself. His legendary films, including Rear Window, The 39 Steps and Notorious, coupled with his TV show, Alfred Hitchock Presents, aired his singular brand of evil and salvation. In this enthralling, scholarly and candid appraisal of the artist, McGilligan, a biographer of James Cagney and Jack Nicholson, neatly reveals the man behind the camera. A quiet Catholic boy from London's East End, Hitchcock (1899- 1980) began as a production designer on silent films and eventually became Britain's premier movie director. David Selznick tapped him for Hollywood, and although their relationship was stormy, it spelled success. Hitchcock, who claimed, \"I'm not interested in logic, I'm interested in effect,\" quickly redefined the medium. He told his stories visually, invented innovative camera angles and reveled in suspense tales. Always, he was aided by his wife, Alma, an invaluable partner on every project. A Hitchcock film \"characteristically mingled light with darkness,\" possibly because its creator was so conflicted. Hitchcock adored gossip, dirty jokes and icy blondes, though, sexually impotent, he could not consummate his desire; his voyeurism instead played out on screen. He relished the occasional cruelty, but it did not obscure his genius or his generosity. He worked tirelessly for the British war effort, though America was committed to neutrality until Pearl Harbor, and was deeply loyal to old friends. McGilligan has crafted an inside look at this unique director and the studio machinations that sustained him. Film buffs will relish how power and creativity play out in Hollywood. The rest will learn how obsession can produce art. 32-page b&w; photo insert not seen by PW.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.",

Vee has an inexplicable ability; when falling into what appears to be a narcoleptic state, she is really &#x201C;sliding&#x201D; into the mind of someone else&#x2014;watching events through their eyes. The mere touch of an object can trigger an episode, and they seem to be getting more frequent and more intense. When she slides into the mind of a murderer who has killed a friend and made it look like a suicide, Vee tries to channel her ability to solve the crime without revealing how she knows the truth. The story is intriguing and provides just enough information for the reader to piece together the mystery alongside Vee. The characters are well developed, with the exception of the murderer, whose motive, while believable, is not executed well enough to lift the climax above melodrama. Still, the novel is difficult to put down. While Vee&#x2019;s questions about sliding remain unanswered, the knowledge that she can live with who she is may be the greatest truth uncovered.

        "0061843407": "Book DescriptionWith the end of summer closing in and a steamy Labor Day weekend looming in the town of Holton Mills, New Hampshire, thirteen-year-old Henry&#8212;lonely, friendless, not too good at sports&#8212;spends most of his time watching television, reading, and daydreaming about the soft skin and budding bodies of his female classmates. For company Henry has his long-divorced mother, Adele&#8212;a onetime dancer whose summer project was to teach him how to foxtrot; his hamster, Joe; and awkward Saturday-night outings to Friendly's with his estranged father and new stepfamily. As much as he tries, Henry knows that even with his jokes and his \"Husband for a Day\" coupon, he still can't make his emotionally fragile mother happy. Adele has a secret that makes it hard for her to leave their house, and seems to possess an irreparably broken heart.But all that changes on the Thursday before Labor Day, when a mysterious bleeding man named Frank approaches Henry and asks for a hand. Over the next five days, Henry will learn some of life's most valuable lessons: how to throw a baseball, the secret to perfect piecrust, the breathless pain of jealousy, the power of betrayal, and the importance of putting others&#8212;especially those we love&#8212;above ourselves. And the knowledge that real love is worth waiting for.In a manner evoking Ian McEwan'sAtonementand Nick Hornby'sAbout a Boy, acclaimed author Joyce Maynard weaves a beautiful, poignant tale of love, sex, adolescence, and devastating treachery as seen through the eyes of a young teenage boy&#8212;and the man he later becomes&#8212;looking back at an unexpected encounter that begins one single long, hot, life-altering weekend.The Obsessions BehindLabor Day: An Essay by Joyce MaynardI always tell students, when I teach writing, to locate their obsessions, and look to them when they&#x2019;re searching for the story they should be telling. When a writer attaches her work to the engine of what she cares about most passionately (even irrationally, perhaps) the work will be infused with a similar passion, I believe. And come into being most organically.This new novel of mine--though it&#x2019;s a product of my imagination, not my experience--contains elements of so many of my deepest obsessions. I think that&#x2019;s why I wrote it so easily and swiftly--almost as if I were transcribing a story being dictated to me from inside my brain.Anyone who has read my work for a while can recognize a few obvious connections to my history, starting with the experience of having been, for many years, a single parent of sons (also a daughter) living in a small town not unlike the imaginary town in which I located the novel. I like to think I have a somewhat more stable and grounded hold on reality and life in the world than Adele (and I am, if anything, the opposite of agoraphobic). But I share a number of her attributes: For starters, there&#x2019;s a hugely romantic nature and a love of dancing (though not her abilities on the dance floor; that part is the stuff of fantasy.) On a deeper level, though, I understand well the sorrow and regret a woman feels when the dream of family life as she envisioned it has left her. My sons--though I like to think they would weigh in with more positive feelings about their growing up years than negative ones--could certainly identify with the feelings Henry has, of undue responsibility for his mother. (Henry&#x2019;s innocent gift, to Adele, of the Husband-for-a-Day coupon was inspired by a similar gift presented to me one Christmas by my son Charlie, when he was around nine or ten.)I am always interested--no, fascinated--by children&#x2019;s perceptions of the adults in their world. The mysterious subject of sex, the first discovery of one&#x2019;s own sexuality, and the disquieting experience-- for a child of divorced parents in particular--of witnessing a parent&#x2019;s sexuality even as they embark on their own sexual lives. Complicated enough, when a child is contemplating the idea of his parents together--but the experience for a young person (a boy in particular) of seeing his mother with some other man is one I have thought about for a long time. (Ever since my son Willy--then age seven--responded to my going out on a date for the first time, after separating from his father, by taking a kitchen knife and plunging it directly into the crotch of a cardboard effigy of the country singer Randy Travis that I had propped up in our front hall . . . Willy is now 24 by the way. A very healthy person who displays no signs of being a psychopath.)Back to the obsession list. My experience of having gone through a painful custody battle many years ago--and the horrifying experience of being evaluated as a mother by a guardian ad litem--is in there. My history as a teenage girl with eating disorders also surfaced in this story, along with the guilt I carry about a betrayal I committed--at around that time in life--of a classmate&#x2019;s trust in me, when around age fourteen--an event that formed the basis for the first story I ever published in a magazine (Seventeen), somewhere around 1970 . . .Another experience that found its way into this novel (and one I also wrote about, in non-fiction form, a few years back) was a kind of fantasy love affair I found myself in, when I was myself a young and very lonely single mother, living in a small New Hampshire town with my three young children, and I got a letter (first one, then a hundred more) from a man in prison, who seemed to know and understand me better than anyone else. (I eventually learned--when it appeared he was getting out of prison and coming to visit my children and me--that this man was a double murderer. I first told the story at The Moth in New York, and later wrote it in an essay that appeared in Vogue, and in a collection published a few years back, calledMr. Wrong.)I will add here, that this is the third time in which I have chosen, for the central character of a novel of mine, a character who is thirteen years old. This is clearly an age that means a lot to me, and though I haven&#x2019;t been thirteen for many decades, I still feel very connected to that time of life.One odd little obsession that I included in the novel, with particular pleasure, concerns pie. Ever since the death of my mother, nineteen years ago, I have set myself the task of teaching pie-making to anyone I encounter who expresses frustration with making good crust--and the numbers of my past students have long since entered the triple digits. (I have also often run large gatherings of pie students at my home, to raise money for my political candidate. Always a Democrat . . .) I could talk a lot about what this pie exercise means to me--certainly it has to do with my mother, but also with honoring the old ways of doing things by hand, and paying attention to instinct (more than a recipe). And I have to add, I love it that I was able to include, in a work of fiction, instructions for making a pie crust that really will result in a good pie, if followed.The final obsession I will mention here--and it is the one that inspired my first novel,Baby Love, twenty-eight years ago--is babies. Although I am very different from Adele in many ways, the way she feels about having a baby is how I felt all my life. And what Frank says concerning the importance of paying attention to babies--and later, his thoughts are echoed by Henry, when he becomes a parent of a daughter--is everything I believe, myself. I have never met a baby I didn&#x2019;t like, or a crying baby I didn&#x2019;t feel I could bring to a state of calm. I just like babies a whole lot, and loved writing about that part here.I want to add: I did not intentionally set out to address any of these topics. They just came out, because they&#x2019;re all the things that interest me most. No doubt this is why I loved writing this novel and wrote it so fast. (I could not stop writing.) I wanted to read it.",

Before she's captured, Campbell uses her cellphone to get off a call for help to Bethany Stewart, her colleague in the shadowy outfit known as Tangent. Stewart, in turn, recruits Travis Chase, who was once briefly involved in a Tangent operation, and reveals to him the existence of an \"entity\" resembling a dark metal cylinder that opens a hole in time. Since the entity has shown a horrific future for humanity, Chase and Stewart, who suspects the president was behind the motorcade attack, must scramble to save their friend and forestall devastation in the years to come.

        "0060188707": "There would seem to be little reason for yet another translation of Don Quixote. Translated into English some 20 times since the novel appeared in two parts in 1605 and 1615, and at least five times in the last half-century, it is currently available in multiple editions (the most recent is the 1999 Norton Critical Edition translated by Burton Raffel). Yet Grossman bravely attempts a fresh rendition of the adventures of the intrepid knight Don Quixote and his humble squire Sancho Panza. As the respected translator of many of Latin America's finest writers (among them Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Carlos Fuentes and Mario Vargas Llosa), she is well suited to the task, and her translation is admirably readable and consistent while managing to retain the vigor, sly humor and colloquial playfulness of the Spanish. Erring on the side of the literal, she isn't afraid to turn out clunky sentences; what she loses in smoothness and elegance she gains in vitality. The text is free of archaisms the contemporary reader will rarely stumble over a word and the footnotes (though rather erratically supplied) are generally helpful. Her version easily bests Raffel's ambitious but eccentric and uneven effort, and though it may not immediately supplant standard translations by J.M. Cohen, Samuel Putnam and Walter Starkie, it should give them a run for their money. Against the odds, Grossman has given us an honest, robust and freshly revelatory Quixote for our times.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Two versions of the fierce competition for the largest buyout ever consummated are presented by skilled journalists with contrasting styles. Burrough and Helyar are clearly fascinated with the personalities of the players in the deal and with the trappings of corporate wealth. The restless, flamboyant personality of Ross Johnson, CEO of RJR Nabisco, is portrayed as the key to the events that were to unfold. The colorful description of all of the players and the events will likely have broad appeal. Lampert signals the complexity of her story by introducing her narrative with a three-page cast of characters. Her focus on the strategy of the players and on the fast-paced action provides a more concise description of a deal big enough to augment the wealth of many rich people.

Then a  friend who's housesitting for Anne is murdered in what's clearly a case of  mistaken identity, and Anne realizes that the past has caught up with her and  that the only way to outrun it is to catch the killer before he realizes that  she's still alive. But how can Anne play dead with a high-profile case just days  away from starting? The only way to pull it off is to let her new colleagues in  on the secret, which would mean telling them her other secrets, too, including  the fact that she's in love with opposing counsel and the probability that her  client may not be as innocent as she thought he was.

Sugar Beth Carey, \"the wild child of Parrish, Mississippi,\" was once the queen of all she surveyed, but after 15 years and three marriages, she's a broken (and broke) husk of her former self. Who's loving the schadenfreude? The Seawillows, for starters-the gaggle of Southern belles Sugar dumped years ago, plus Winnie Davis, the half-sister she treated like dirt. And there's more: not only did Sugar stomp on gorgeous Ryan Galantine's heart (luckily, Winnie caught him on the rebound), she also got Colin Byrne, the sexy British high school teacher, fired for ostensibly coming on to her. Colin now owns her family's manse, and she's inherited the carriage house on his property-along with a highly valuable painting, location unknown (might it be hiding in Colin's attic? Or is it right under her nose?). Phillips keeps the tension high, with Colin (now a successful writer and member of the town's \"in\" crowd) and all of the rest of Parrish looking to make Sugar pay for past misdeeds. Colin hires her to be his housekeeper, and soon their days are filled with bickering, backstabbing and lots of orgasmic sex. A subplot involving Gigi, Winnie and Ryan's rebellious teenage daughter, who somewhat improbably turns to Sugar Beth for advice, detracts from the primary drama. The novel is at its best when Phillips sticks with what she does best-fast-paced romps featuring two headstrong people who finally realize that they're soul mates.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Completed in 1436, the dome remains a remarkable feat of design and engineering. Its span of more than 140 feet exceeds St Paul's in London and St Peter's in Rome, and even outdoes the Capitol in Washington, D.C., making it the largest dome ever constructed using bricks and mortar. The story of its creation and its brilliant but \"hot-tempered\" creator is told inRoss King'sdelightfulBrunelleschi's Dome.Both dome and architect offer King plenty of rich material. The story of the dome goes back to 1296, when work began on the cathedral, but it was only in 1420, when Brunelleschi won a competition over his bitter rival Lorenzo Ghiberti to design the daunting cupola, that work began in earnest. King weaves an engrossing tale from the political intrigue, personal jealousies, dramatic setbacks, and sheer inventive brilliance that led to the paranoid Filippo, \"who was so proud of his inventions and so fearful of plagiarism,\" finally seeing his dome completed only months before his death. King argues that it was Brunelleschi's improvised brilliance in solving the problem of suspending the enormous cupola in bricks and mortar (painstakingly detailed with precise illustrations) that led him to \"succeed in performing an engineering feat whose structural daring was without parallel.\" He tells a compelling, informed story, ranging from discussions of the construction of the bricks, mortar, and marble that made up the dome, to its subsequent use as a scientific instrument by the Florentine astronomer Paolo Toscanelli.--Jerry Brotton, Amazon.co.uk--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

It was a prophecy that their last king had given on his deathwatch.\" But joy is mixed with tragedy, for Eleonora's mother dies soon after the birth.Raised by her doting father, Yakob, a carpet merchant, and her stern, resentful stepmother, Ruxandra, Eleonora spends her early years daydreaming and doing housework&#x2014;until the moment she teaches herself to read, and her father recognizes that she is an extraordinarily gifted child, a prodigy.When Yakob sets off by boat for Stamboul on business, eight-year-old Eleonora, unable to bear the separation, stows away in one of his trunks. On the shores of the Bosporus, in the house of her father's business partner, Moncef Bey, a new life awaits. Books, backgammon, beautiful dresses and shoes, markets swarming with color and life&#x2014;the imperial capital overflows with elegance, and mystery. For in the narrow streets of Stamboul&#x2014;a city at the crossroads of the world&#x2014;intrigue and gossip are currency, and people are not always what they seem. Eleonora's tutor, an American minister and educator, may be a spy. The kindly though elusive Moncef Bey has a past history of secret societies and political maneuvering. And what is to be made of the eccentric, charming Sultan Abdulhamid II himself, beleaguered by friend and foe alike as his unwieldy, multiethnic empire crumbles?The Oracle of Stamboulis a marvelously evocative, magical historical novel that will transport readers to another time and place&#x2014;romantic, exotic, yet remarkably similar to our own.Amazon Exclusive: A Q&amp;A with Michael David LukasQ:Talk about your inspiration for the characters. Was Eleonora based on anyone?Lukas:I started writingThe Oracle of Stamboulin early 2004. At the time I was living in Tunisia, studying Arabic, applying to MFA programs, and generally trying to figure out what to do with my life. Eleonora came to me on a run through the undeveloped outskirts of Tunis. She was hazy in that first glimpse, a slight, precocious child playing backgammon with two older men. I didn&#x2019;t know anything about her&#x2014;where she lived or when, who these men were, why she was playing backgammon with them&#x2014;but I knew as soon as she came to me that I had found the protagonist of my novel. At first, I thought of her as a mix between Alice fromAlice in Wonderlandand Roald Dahl&#x2019;sMatilda. A few months later, rummaging through an antique store in Istanbul, I came across a picture of a young girl from the 1880s. When I saw this picture, everything clicked. Here was Eleonora, staring out across history with a laconic, penetrating gaze. Over the next six years, she took on a life and character of her own. Eleonora still has elements of Alice, Matilda, and the girl in the picture, but she has become her own person.Q:Would you consider the novel to be a fairy tale?Lukas:The Oracle of Stamboulis very much inspired by fairy tales. Before I began writing the third draft of the novel, I made a point of reading Maria Tartar&#x2019;s annotated version of the Brothers&#x2019; Grimm. Reading these wonderful, dark, and intimately familiar stories again&#x2014;as an adult and as a writer&#x2014;helped me understand my novel in a new way. The Brothers&#x2019; Grimm taught me the power of a single magical object and the importance of simplicity, in both plot and character. Their stories also reminded me that I wantedThe Oracle of Stamboulto be more than a fairy tale. I wanted the novel to have the wonder and familiarity of a story like &#x201C;Hansel and Gretel&#x201D; or &#x201C;Rapunzel,&#x201D; but I also wanted it to incorporate the magic of place and the sweep of history.Q:How might readers of different ages experience the book?Lukas:I hopeThe Oracle of Stamboulwill appeal to a wide range of readers: people who love reading for its power to transport, to inform, and to inspire; adults who read literary novels; and those adults who read the occasional young adult novel; precocious teenagers; those who want to learn about the Ottoman Empire or Istanbul; and anyone who wants to connect with the preternaturally intelligent child inside them. One could read the novel for Eleonora&#x2019;s story, for the sense of history, for the sense of place, or for the various historical questions I hope the book raises. And none of these readings is better than the others.Q:Who are the writers and books that have influenced you the most? What books do you think are complementary in style or mien toThe Oracle of Stamboul?Lukas:Among many others,The Oracle of Stamboulis influenced by Charles Dickens, Roald Dahl, Italo Calvino, and Gabriel Garc&#xED;a M&#xE1;rquez. During the year I started writing the book I had a lot of free time. In the period of a few months I read most of Vladimir Nabokov, John Steinbeck, James Baldwin, and Flannery O&#x2019;Connor, all writers I look to still for inspiration. I was most taken, however, by those whose work falls into the subgenre I like to call historical fabulism&#x2014;Jos&#xE9; Saramago, G&#xFC;nter Grass, and Salman Rushdie&#x2014;storytellers of the old school who add a pinch of magic to the stew of history. I was particularly moved by Saramago&#x2019;s novelThe History of the Siege of Lisbon, in which a bored proofreader literally rewrites the history of Lisbon, and by Grass&#x2019;sThe Tin Drum, in which a clairvoyant young German boy named Oskar Matzerath disrupts the traditional narrative of World War II by beating on a tin drum. How wonderful, this idea that a single act, a single person, might change the course of history.Q:You teach creative writing to third and fourth graders. What have you learned from working with them?Lukas:This past semester my students participated in National Novel Writing Month. It was kind of a crazy idea, but it worked wonderfully. One student wrote a novel about a panda who is adopted by mice. Another student wrote about a ghostly tooth fairy who is his own worst enemy. And then there was the pair who collaborated on a novel about a moldy pickle and a moldy cucumber who are best friends and want more than anything to escape the refrigerator. When I started teaching the creative writing to third and fourth graders&#x2014;through an afterschool program called Take My Word For It!&#x2014;I was going through a bit of a quarter life crisis. My students&#x2019; wide-eyed enthusiasm and seemingly-infinite imaginations helped me to regain my sense of wonder and possibility in the world. And they taught me that no idea is too crazy.",

In the third in Lemony Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events, there is still no hope on the horizon for these poor children. Their adventures are exciting and memorable, but, as the author points out, \"exciting and memorable like being chased by a werewolf through a field of thorny bushes at midnight with nobody around to help you.\"This story begins when the orphans are being escorted by the well-meaning Mr. Poe to yet another distant relative who has agreed to take them in since their parents were killed in a horrible fire. Aunt Josephine, their new guardian, is their second cousin's sister-in-law, and she is afraid of everything. Her house (perched precariously on a cliff above Lake Lachrymose) is freezing because she is afraid of the radiator exploding, she eats cold cucumber soup because she's afraid of the stove, and she doesn't answer the telephone due to potential electrocution dangers. Her greatest joy in life is grammar, however, and when it comes to the proper use of the English language, she is fearless.But just when she should be the most fearful--when Count Olaf creeps his way back to find the Baudelaire orphans and steal their fortune--she somehow lets her guard down. Once again, it is up to Violet, Klaus, and Sunny to get themselves out of danger. Will they succeed? We haven't the stomach to tell you.

Harvey undertakes the tast because \"Women are clueless about men,\" because \"Men get away with a whole lot of stuff\" and because he has \"some valuable information to change all of that.\" Harvey makes a game effort, taking a bold but familiar men-are-dogs approach: if you're \"cutting back\" on sex, \"he will have another woman lined up and waiting to give him what he needs and wants--the cookie.\" Several chapters later, however, he introduces the \"ninety-day rule,\" asserting that, actually, he won't always have another woman lined up--and the only way to makes sure is a three-month vetting period. Harvey also tackles mama's boys, \"independent--and lonely--women,\" and the matter of children in the dating world (\"If he's meeting the kids after you decide he's the one, it's too late\"). Feminists and the easily offended probably won't take to Harvey's blanket statements and blunt advice, but Harvey's fans and those in need of tough (but ticklish) love advice should check it out (especially the hysterical last-chapter Q&A;).Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Foster teen Molly is performing community-service work for elderly widow Vivian, and as they go through Vivian&#x2019;s cluttered attic, they discover that their lives have much in common. When Vivian was a girl, she was taken to a new life on an orphan train. These trains carried children to adoptive families for 75 years, from the mid-nineteenth century to the start of the Great Depression. Novelist Kline (Bird in Hand, 2009) brings Vivian&#x2019;s hardscrabble existence in &#xAD;Depression-era Minnesota to stunning life. Molly&#x2019;s present-day story in Maine seems to pale in comparison, but as we listen to the two characters talk, we find grace and power in both of these seemingly disparate lives. Although the girls are vulnerable, left to the whims of strangers, they show courage and resourcefulness.

It was gorgeous and unfamiliar and deeply fascinating.  Unfortunately, I stayed there for ten days.  There are a lot of insects in the Amazon, a lot of mud, surprisingly few vegetables, too many snakes.  You can&rsquo;t go anywhere by yourself, which makes sense if you don&rsquo;t know the terrain, but I enjoy going places by myself.  I can see how great it would be for a very short visit, and how great it would be if you lived there and had figured out what was and wasn&rsquo;t going to kill you, but the interim length of time isn&rsquo;t great.EG:Didn't I hear that you have a sort of magical story about a friend who is also a writer, who was also once going to write a book about the Amazon? Can you share this miraculous tale? Also, is your writer friend pretty?AP:This friend of mine, who happens to be you, is gorgeous, and much taller in real life.  Yes, you were writing a novel about the Amazon, and then you decided not to write a novel about the Amazon, and then I started writing a novel about the Amazon, and later when we compared notes (your book dismissed, mine halfway finished) they had remarkably similar story lines, to the point of being eerie.   I thought this must be because it was an incredibly banal idea and we had both come up with a generic Amazon novel, but then you told me that ideas fly around looking for homes, and when the idea hadn&rsquo;t worked out with you it came to me.   If this is true I think your name should be on the cover.  It would increase sales significantly.EG:Readers of your prior work--particularly the luminousBel Canto--will be delighted to see that opera makes an appearance in this novel, as well. In fact, one of the most dramatic scenes in the book takes place at the opera. Is that a wink and a nod to loyal readers, or just an expression of your own deep and abiding musical passions?AP:It&rsquo;s a wink and a nod to Werner Herzog and his brilliant Amazon film &ldquo;Fitzcarraldo&rdquo; which opens at the opera house in Manaus where the aforementioned scene takes place.  I had very little experience with opera when I wroteBel Canto, and since then it&rsquo;s become a huge part of my life.

I personally know you to be a homebody who likes to bake muffins for neighbors. How the heck did you pull off this wildness so convincingly? Was it as invigorating to write as it is to read?AP:Ah, the life of the mind.  All the adventure I need I can dream up in my kitchen.  I love writing outside of my own experience, making imaginary worlds.  If I wrote novels based on my own life I would not be making a living at this.  I also love to write a strong plot.  I want things to happen in my books, I want to be thrilled.  I always think about Raymond Chandler.

(And when they saw the obvious-but-brilliant Chip Kidd-designed cover, their eyes got even brighter.) Everyone, it seems, feels a personal connection to Peanuts (a name, by the way, that Schulz always hated), but few have a sense of the artist whose small troupe of big-headed characters still lives at the center of our imagination. If some mystery about the man still remains after reading Michaelis's sharp, engaging, and level-headed biography that's no fault of the biographer--in fact, it's to his credit. Michaelis parses Schulz's particular combination of Midwestern reserve and steely determination and the strip's still-surprising balance of exuberance and misery, and he reminds us what a colossal cultural force it became, especially in the 1960s. But even as he ingeniously finds sources for Schulz's four-panel vignettes in the events of his biography, he recognizes that the true, sometimes inexplicable drama of his life took place when he sat down every day for 50 years to trace Linus's wobbly strands of hair, fill in Snoopy's black nose, and, time and again, letter the words \"Good grief.\"--Tom Nissley--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

Cornelia also yields narrative time to Dev, a precocious teenager whose father is missing and whose mother develops a friendship with Cornelia. Dev's connection to the story is initially unclear, though he does grow close to Clare, a troubled teenager with an unconventional connection to Cornelia, and a late-breaking development grounds his role more firmly.

The two meet in Italy, and almost immediately Hemingway sets up the central tension of the novel: the tenuous nature of love in a time of war. During their first encounter, Catherine tells Henry about her fianc&eacute; of eight years who had been killed the year before in the Somme. Explaining why she hadn't married him, she says she was afraid marriage would be bad for him, then admits:I wanted to do something for him. You see, I didn't care about the other thing and he could have had it all. He could have had anything he wanted if I would have known. I would have married him or anything. I know all about it now. But then he wanted to go to war and I didn't know.The two begin an affair, with Henry quite convinced that he \"did not love Catherine Barkley nor had any idea of loving her. This was a game, like bridge, in which you said things instead of playing cards.\" Soon enough, however, the game turns serious for both of them and ultimately Henry ends up deserting to be with Catherine.Hemingway was not known for either unbridled optimism or happy endings, andA Farewell to Arms, like his other novels (For Whom the Bell Tolls,The Sun Also Rises, andTo Have and Have Not), offers neither. What itdoesprovide is an unblinking portrayal of men and women behaving with grace under pressure, both physical and psychological, and somehow finding the courage to go on in the face of certain loss.--Alix Wilber--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

No wonder 14-year-old Georgia Nicolson laments, \"Honestly, what is the point?\" A Bridget Jones for the younger set, Georgia records the momentous events of her life--and they are all momentous--in her diary, which serves as a truly hilarious account of what it means to be a modern girl on the cusp of womanhood. No matter that her particular story takes place in England, the account of her experiences rings true across the ocean (and besides, \"Georgia's Glossary\" swiftly eradicates any language barriers).The author, Louise Rennison, is a British comedy writer and it shows. Whether  Georgia is dealing with wearing a bra (\"OK, it's a bit on the loose side and does ride up round my neck if I run for the bus\"), pondering kissing and how to know which way to turn your head (\"You don't want to be bobbing around like pigeons for hours\"), or managing the results of an overzealous eyebrow-plucking episode (\"Obviously, now I have to stay in forever\"), she always cracks us up. Georgia struggles with the myriad issues facing teen girls--boys, of course being at the forefront--but she does it with such humor and honesty it almost seems like a good time. This refreshingly funny book is ripe for a sequel, which readers will await in droves.

The game doesn't approach the epic scale of either of those titles, but  once you get used to its smaller scale, the various charms of this game do  become obvious.The game involves you, as Mario's brother Luigi, trying to exorcise a haunted  mansion of ghosts by sucking them into a vacuum cleaner. It sounds easier than  the previous cinematic attempts by theGhostbustersand theCatholic Church, but it's not.  The complications and cleverness of the game manifest in the use of light and  shadow. Many ghosts cannot be seen unless you reveal their shadows or manipulate  the objects in a room to make them appear. These imaginative--but never  frustrating--puzzles add to the otherwise simplistic process of catching the  smaller ghosts by freezing them with a beam of light and sucking them up with  your Hoover backpack.It's only a minor classic, butLuigi's Mansiondoes show off some off the  GameCube's graphic effects and provides a game the whole family can enjoy.

        "0061238600": "The award-winning PostSecret project's most profound and stunning postcards to dateFor the past three years Frank Warren has invited people of all backgrounds and nationalities to send him creatively decorated postcards bearing secrets they have never before revealed. He has shared these PostSecrets on his award-winning blog, www.PostSecret.com, in an internationally traveling art exhibit, and in three electrifying books: the bestsellingPostSecret, My Secret,andThe Secret Lives of Men and Women.Now, in his most extraordinary book yet, Warren again delves into our collective confessions, presenting a never-before-seen selection of provocative and moving PostSecrets.A Lifetime of Secretslays bare our private fears, hopes, regrets, and desires, from people as young as eight and as old as eighty. From painful admissions of infidelity to breathtaking revelations and endearing sentiments, Warren's latest collection will shock and move readers of every age, revealing secrets that have haunted their creators for a lifetime.Six PostSecrets fromA Lifetime of SecretsHere are six of the PostSecrets included inA Lifetime of Secrets, and never before seen online. Click on each image to see a larger version.Frank Warren's Introduction toA Lifetime of SecretsWhen I told my father I was collecting secrets from strangers for an art project, he didn&#x92;t know what to think. I tried to explain how the thousands of secrets that had been mailed to me were more than mere confessions. They could be beautiful, funny, sorrowful, inspiring.\"But, Frank,\" he asked, \"why are you soliciting secrets from strangers, and why would anyone tell you a real secret?\"I invited my father to fly out for a PostSecret art exhibit in Washington, D.C., where hundreds of the postcards were on display. More than 15,000 people came to see the secrets, and my father was there, day after day, to hear many of their transformative stories. Some people told me they recognized a hidden part of themselves on a stranger&#x92;s postcard. Others shared personal experiences of how talking about a painful secret had helped heal a lifelong relationship.The exhibit came to an end and I took my father back to the airport to catch a red-eye flight home. During our drive we passed through a long dark stretch of highway when my father broke the silence by asking me, \"Do you want to know my secret?\" He bravely recounted a traumatic childhood experience. When he finished, we had a true talk that gave me a richer understanding of my father and recast our relationship.&#x95; &#x95; &#x95;ForA Lifetime of Secrets, the fourth PostSecret book, I've selected postcards that show how secrets can reveal a momentary impulse or haunt us for decades and arranged them by age to follow the common journey we all take through childhood, adolescence, adulthood, maturity. Stretched over a full lifespan, the secrets expose the meaningful ways we change over time, and the surprising ways we don't.The postcards narrate childhood stories that have never been spoken; they voice the guarded confessions of our parents and grandparents. They confirm that our rich interior lives are not defined by how old we are, and that with aging comes not only loss but also the possibility of grace and wisdom.The following two secrets arrived in my mailbox the same week. The postmarks on each card were different, but when I posted them together on the PostSecret website (www.postsecret.com) they seemed as though they could have been written by the same person at two different points in her life.I am a junior in high school. I have good friends and a loving family. I am smart. I am a good athlete and musician. But I would trade all that in if it meant I would be beautiful.I spent my high school years believing I was UGLY. I just went through a photo album that had pictures of me over the last 20 years. Turns out I was/am kind of cute. No more wasting time on thinking otherwise.&#x95; &#x95; &#x95;When I give PostSecret presentations at college campuses, my hope is that people I have never met will be inspired to change their lives through the secrets and stories being shared. Not long ago, at one of my talks, it was my life that was changed, and the secret that inspired me came from a stranger in the front row.I began my presentation by handing out blank postcards to everyone in the auditorium. I invited each person to anonymously write down a secret on a card and then pass it on. For the next hour, the postcards circulated and were read silently multiple times. At the end of my talk, I asked if anyone would like to stand and read the secret they were holding at that moment. A man in the front row stood up and haltingly read:I wish I could apologize to my younger brother for the way I treated him growing up.He sat down and exchanged a long look with the young man next to him. After more volunteers read aloud some of the other secrets that had been passed around, I collected all the cards. The man in the front row handed me the postcard he had read from, and the two men walked out together.His postcard was blank.I have witnessed many times how the courage of sharing a secret can be contagious. When I realized that the man had been pretending to read someone else&#x92;s secret and that the person he had left with was likely his brother, I was inspired.Growing up, I was not an ideal older brother. As an adult, I have wished for an opportunity to apologize for some of my actions but did not want to open old wounds. I have not shared this secret with my brother . . . until now.--Frank Warren",

        "006019491X": "Oprah Book Club&#174; Selection, February 2000:Until Isabel Allende burst onto the scene with her 1985 debut,The House of the Spirits, Latin American fiction was, for the most part, a boys' club comprising such heavy hitters as Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez, Jorge Luis Borges, and Mario Vargas Llosa.  But the Chilean Allende shouldered her way in with her magical realist multi-generational tale of the Trueba family, followed it up with four more novels and a spate of nonfiction, and has remained in a place of honor ever since. Her sixth work of fiction,Daughter of Fortune, shares some characteristics with her earlier works: the canvas is wide, the characters are multi-generational and multi-ethnic, and the protagonist is an unconventional woman who overcomes enormous obstacles to make her way in the world. Yet one cannot accuse Allende of telling the same story twice; set in the mid-1800s, this novel follows the fortunes of Eliza Sommers, Chilean by birth but adopted by a British spinster, Rose Sommers, and her bachelor brother, Jeremy, after she is abandoned on their doorstep.\"You have English blood, like us,\" Miss Rose assured Eliza when she was old enough to understand. \"Only someone from the British colony would have thought to leave you in a basket on the doorstep of the British Import and Export Company, Limited. I am sure they knew how good-hearted my brother Jeremy is, and felt sure he would take you in. In those days I was longing to have a child, and you fell into my arms, sent by God to be brought up in the solid principles of the Protestant faith and the English language.\"The family servant, Mama Fresia, has a different point of view, however: \"You, English? Don't get any ideas, child. You have Indian hair, like mine.\" And certainly Eliza's almost mystical ability to recall all the events of her life would seem to stem more from the Indian than the Protestant side.As Eliza grows up, she becomes less tractable, and when she falls in love with Joachin Andieta, a clerk in Jeremy's firm, her adoptive family is horrified. They are even more so when a now-pregnant Eliza follows her lover to California where he has gone to make his fortune in the 1849 gold rush. Along the way Eliza meets Tao Chi'en, a Chinese doctor who saves her life and becomes her closest friend. What starts out as a search for a lost love becomes, over time, the discovery of self; and by the time Eliza finally catches up with the elusive Joachin, she is no longer sure she still wants what she once wished for.  Allende peoples her novel with a host of colorful secondary characters. She even takes the narrative as far afield as China, providing an intimate portrait of Tao Chi'en's past before returning to 19th-century San Francisco, where he and Eliza eventually fetch up. Readers with a taste for the epic, the picaresque, and romance that is satisfyingly complex will find them all inDaughter of Fortune.--Margaret Prior",
        "0099481685": "John Grisham turns a satirical eye on the overblown ritual of the festive holiday season, and the result isSkipping Christmas, a modest but funny novel about the tyranny of December 25. Grisham's story revolves around a typical middle-aged American couple, Luther and Nora Krank. On the first Sunday after Thanksgiving they wave their daughter Blair off to Peru to work for the Peace Corps, and they suddenly realize that \"for the first time in her young and sheltered life Blair would spend Christmas away from home.\"Luther Krank sees his daughter's Christmas absence as an opportunity. He estimates that \"a year earlier, the Luther Krank family had spent $6,100 on Christmas,\" and have \"precious little to show for it.\" So he makes an executive decision, telling his wife, friends, and neighbors that \"we won't do Christmas.\" Instead, Luther books a 10-day Caribbean cruise. But things start to turn nasty when horrified neighbors get wind of the Krank's subversive scheme and besiege the couple with questions about their decision.Grisham builds up a funny but increasingly terrifying picture of how this  tight-knit community turns on the Kranks, who find themselves under increasing pressure to conform. As the tension mounts, readers may wonder whether they will manage to board their plane on Christmas day.Skipping Christmasis Grisham-lite, with none of the serious action or drama of his legal thrillers, but a funny poke at the craziness of Christmas.--Jerry Brotton, Amazon.co.uk--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

        "0060746408": "Touted as aBall Fourfor the new millennium, Jose Canseco'sJuicedpromises to expose not only the rampant use of performance-enhancing substances in baseball (with steroids replacing the amphetamines of Bouton's day), but the painfully human flaws of its heroes as well. A steroid devotee since the age of 20, Canseco goes beyond admitting his own usage to claim that with the tacit approval of the league's powers-that-be he acted as baseball's ambassador of steroids and is therefore indirectly responsible for \"saving\" the game.Chief among his claims is that he introduced Mark McGwire to steroids in 1988 and that he often injected McGwire while they were teammates. According to Canseco, steroids and human growth hormones gave McGwire and Sammy Sosa (whose own usage was \"so obvious, it was a joke\") the strength, stamina, regenerative ability, and confidence they needed for a record-setting home run duel often credited with restoring baseball's popularity after the 1994 strike. Although he devotes a lot of ink to McGwire, Canseco envisions himself as a kind of Johnny Steroidseed, spreading the gospel of performance enhancement, naming a number of players that he either personally introduced to steroids or is relatively certain he can identify as fellow users. Because Canseco plays fast and loose with some of the facts of his own career he provides fodder for those looking to damage his credibility, but in many ways questions of public and personal perception are what raise the book beyond mere vitriolic tell-all. Those willing to heed his request and truly listen to what he has to say will findJuicedto be an occasionally insightful meditation on the workings of public perception and a consistently interesting character study.--Shane Farmer",

Along the Atlantic coastline, a monster &#151; somehow familiar, yet still quite different from anything ever seen &#151; has been snatching little girls and bringing them back to the undersea city. It is a Big Sister, new denizens of Rapture who were once one of the forgotten little girls known as Little Sisters, known to inhabit the city's dank halls. No longer a pawn used to harvest ADAM, the dangerously powerful gene-altering lifeblood of Rapture, from the bodies of others and in turn run the risk of being harvested herself, the Big Sister is now the fastest and most powerful thing in Rapture. You, on the other hand are the very first Big Daddy, in fact the prototype, that for some reason has reactivated. You are similar to the Big Daddies familiar from the originalBioShock, but also very different in that you possess free will and no memory of the events of the past ten years. The question is, as you travel through the decrepit and beautiful fallen city beneath the waves, hunting for answers and the solution to your own survival, are you really the hunter, or the hunted?Gameplay and MultiplayerInBioShock 2players will take on the role of the original Big Daddy, not that of game one protagonist, Jack. As a Big Daddy you will have access to all the strengths and weapons of a standard Big Daddy, including the drill and rivet gun. More importantly you also possess free will and the ability to use plasmids and gene tonics &#151; genetic modifications allowed for through ADAM, a stem cell harvested from conquered enemies, or sea slugs outside the Rapture air lock, and powered by the in-game injectable serum known as EVE, which can be found, captured or purchased. Plasmids and gene tonics provide a wide range of aggressive and passive abilities which can be upgraded and arranged for quick use. The ability to use plasmids and tonics gives you a decided edge over other Big Daddies and most other denizens of Rapture, excluding the powerful Big Sisters. In addition, due to their role as a Big Daddy, players will experience a new relation to the Little Sisters. Upon defeating standard Big Daddys you are given the familiar choice as to whether to harvest or adopt them. Harvesting gains you ADAM immediately, but could alter your path through the game, while adopting makes you responsible for Little Sisters, who then accompany you through Rapture, but also provide aid and warning in times of danger. Additional gameplay features include: new plasmids, weapons and the ability to combine these two.The game also features the anticipated multiplayer modes. Several of these are team-based, allowing up to 10 players. Within these players are provided with a rich prequel experience that expands the origins of theBioShockfiction, and allows you to play as one of several characters pulled from Rapture's history before the events of the first game.Key FeaturesThe Big Sister- No longer just something to be harvested or not, the Big Sister is the most powerful resident in Rapture.You Are the Big Daddy- Take control with the original prototype Big Daddy, and experience the power and raw strength of Rapture&rsquo;s most feared denizens as you battle powerful new enemies.New Plasmids- New plasmids such as \"Aero Dash\" allowing for bursts of speed over short distances, and \"Geyser Trap\" a stream of water used as a jump pad and electrical conductor, join the ample list of Plasmids from the original game.New Game Mechanics-BioShock 2contains many new gameplay mechanics. Just a few of these are: the ability to wield plasmids and weapons simultaneously; flashback missions detailing how you became the Big Daddy; the ability to walk outside the airlocks of Rapture to discover new play areas, and many more.New Locations- Just a few of the locations and environments debuting inBioShock 2are Fontaine Futuristics, headquarters of Fontaine's business empire and the Kashmir Restaurant.Evolution of the Genetically Enhanced Shooter- Innovative advances bring new depth and dimension to each encounter, allowing players to create exciting combinations to fit their style of gameplay.Return to Rapture- Set approximately 10 years after the events of the original BioShock, the story continues with an epic, more intense journey through one of the most captivating and terrifying fictional worlds ever created.Genetically Enhanced Multiplayer- Earn experience points during gameplay to earn access to new weapons, plasmids and tonics that can be used to create hundreds of different combinations.Experience Rapture&rsquo;s Civil War- Players will step into the shoes of Rapture's citizens and take direct part in the civil war that tore Rapture apart.See Rapture Before the Fall- Experience Rapture before it was reclaimed by the ocean and engage in combat over iconic environments in locations such as Kashmir Restaurant and Mercury Suites, all of which have been reworked from the ground up for multiplayer.",

Grade 5&ndash;9&mdash;In this masterful fantasy told in two voices, Levine has created a mythology and society as rich and nuanced as the one portrayed in Megan Whalen Turner'sThe Thief(Greenwillow, 1996). Olus is the Akkan god of the winds, but he is hundreds of years younger than any of the other gods and, therefore, very lonely. He visits Hyte, a kingdom of humans, where he is intrigued by the beautiful and talented weaver and dancer named Kezi. Olus witnesses the events leading to her generous but reckless decision to offer up her life so that her father can keep the oath he's sworn to their god, Admat. He follows her, introduces himself in human guise, and the two fall in love. This is where the book deepens, even as the plot intensifies. Can Kezi love a god? Can she love a pantheistic god, even though she was raised to believe only in Admat? The nature of religious conviction and the tensions between different belief systems are questioned&mdash;but so deftly that readers are entertained by the arguments. With barely a month until Kezi becomes a human sacrifice, she and Olus search for a way to reconcile the need to honor her father's oath and their desire for one another. To prove themselves \"champions,\" worthy of immortal life together, they each must endure a quest and face their deepest fears. The power of love and courage to overcome seemingly impossible odds and to bridge ostensibly untraversable differences are at the heart of this compelling, intensely satisfying fantasy.&mdash;Miriam Lang Budin, Chappaqua Public Library, NYCopyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Sent as ambassador to the Northern principality of Uberwald where they mine gold, iron, and fat--but never silver--he is caught up in an uneasy truce between dwarfs, werewolves, and vampires in the theft of the Scone of Stone (a particularly important piece of dwarf bread) and in the old werewolf custom of giving humans a short start in the hunt and then cheating.Pratchett is always at his best when the comedy is combined with a real sense of jeopardy that even favorite characters might be hurt if there was a good joke in it.

The concept behind the latestMetal Gear Solidproject is \"no place to hide,\" and this edition in the series will force Snake into unexpected circumstances with an all-new storyline that breaks away in some ways from the previousMGSfranchise entries. We don't want to spoil it for you, but, producer Hideo Kojima did reveal some very juicy tidbits about the game and the storyline when it was first announced at E3 of 2006. \"Until now,\" said Kojima, \"we've released two entries of theMSX2 Metal Gearseries, and three entries in theMetal Gear Solidseries. Add to thisPortable Ops, and you get a total of six titles. All mysteries will be cleared up inMetal Gear Solid 4.\"Kojima was very clear about the finality ofMSG4, leaving gamers to wonder, \"Will Snake die?!\" When asked if the story will come to this sort of an end, Kojima responded without the slightest bit of vagueness, \"It will come to an end.\" TheMGS4E3 trailer showed a number of characters from theMetal GearandMetal Gear Solidhistories. This final installment is sure to deliver loads of cameos, in fact, it is rumored that nearly all the characters from the series will make an appearance.In addition to a return of classicMetal Gear Solidcharacters, the gameplay systems from part three are also expected to make a comeback.

OctoCamo allows Snake to blend in with his environment as it digitally manifests nearby textures in real time.

It has also been revealed thatMGS4will have online play, but no specifics have been released.

The first three games in the series are centered on the sword play and gun slinging of demon hunter and long-time hero, Dante, but in the most recent release,Devil May Cry 4, players are thrown a changeup, as doubt is cast on the once unquestionable motives and actions of Dante by a new, yet somehow familiar hero, Nero.Supernatural action with styleNero has all the Demon fighting tools.View larger.Demons rightly fear his \"Devil Bringer\" arm.View larger.There's bad blood between Nero and Dante.View larger.Dante's artful skill with the new Lucifer Weapon.View larger.Meet the New Kid in Town - NeroNero resembles Dante and Dante&#146;s estranged twin brother Virgil, familiar to players from earlier games in the series. This might be more than a just a coincidence--you&#146;ll have to play through the game to find out for sure--but what is certain is that like Virgil, Nero has a serious problem with Dante; one that can only end badly for one of them.AsDMC4opens players not only witness, but participate in Nero&#146;s trial by fire as he is unexpectedly forced to go head-to-head with Dante. The youngest, but most promising new member of the land of Fortuna&#146;s \"Holy Knights,\" the military arm of the \"Order of Maken,\" an organization pledged to destroy all demons as well as defend the memory and worship of Sparda, the historical Dark Knight who rebelled against the Dark Emperor to champion the fate of humanity, the Holy Knights highly respect Dante, who is a direct descendent of Sparda. This makes what Nero and players of the game must do all the more difficult, but no less necessary. A tutorial for learning and developing Nero&#146;s skills as well as serving as the game&#146;s first boss battle, playing as Nero, players must hold their own against the legendary demon hunter before they can proceed further into the game. But be prepared for Dante to return later in the game.The World ofDevil May Cry 4Just as in previous installments in theDMCseries, the world players explore inDevil May Cry 4is lavishly gothic, feeling both ancient and modern simultaneously and is peopled by demons and demon hunters. In this dangerous world player&#146;s weapons are sometimes all they can count on. Although you begin your journey playing in the role of newcomer Nero, players will also have the opportunity to play as Dante, Both character&#146;s arsenals of weapons and abilities are impressive, but not too difficult to master. See the partial list of both character&#146;s weapons and abilities below:Nero\"Devil Bringer\" Arm: Integrated into Nero&#146;s right arm, it is a mystery even to Nero, but quickly reveals itself as a very effective weapon against demons, especially the largest among them.Red Queen: Effective at when swung at high speeds, this sword has a motorcycle handle base that sprays flammable liquid on enemies when squeezed.Blue Rose: Used for long range attacks, this pistol has two barrels which can be fired at once with armor piercing force.The Exceed System: Allows Nero to charge up his sword with a throttle effect, revving up to three levels with powerful attack options.DanteForce Edge: Sharp and indestructible, this sword is a memento from his father Sparda, and was used to defeat the ancient enemy Mundus and seal the gateway to the underworld.Ebony &amp; Ivory: Dante&#146;s twin .45 caliber companion pistols. They are Dante&#146;s trusty companions as he battles supernatural evils.Beowulf: Double gauntlets and greaves hold a flashing power to strike down enemies at close distances.Active Style Change System: These allow Dante to switch between fighting styles and weapons on the fly, producing crazy combo possibilities that players will need to master.Leveling up of both characters is done throughDMC&#146;s traditional orb collection system which can happen at any point in the game, while weapons and abilities are upgradable at the completion of levels through the new \"Proud Souls\" system. In addition the game&#146;s deep combo system rewards players for &#145;stylishly&#146; dispatching enemies by mixing and matching the weapons that they use in attacks, so it pays for players to get to know the arsenals.New Characters and EnvironmentsJoining Nero and Dante as they battle demons and each other throughout the game&#146;s next-generation enhanced environments are a wide array of non-player characters both old and new to theDevil May Cryseries. Familiar faces from the past like Trish and Lady will be there as well as new characters like Kyrie to illustrate Nero&#146;s side of the story in the demon-filled landscapes of Fortuna and continue the legacy of fast paced, rich action players have come to expect from theDevil May Cryuniverse.Additional Collector's Edition Content:Heavy-duty metal game case with protective sleeveTheDevil May CryAnimated SeriesVolume 1 (4 full length episodes)More than 2 hours of contentLearn more about the world ofDevil May CryBonus DVDArt galleryGame soundtrack\"Making of\" videoDownloadable PC content--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

The sequel, The Power of Six (2011), divided itself into two first-person POVs, and this one continues the trend by chopping the perspective into thirds, resulting in ever more opportunities to cinematically cross-cut between the snowballing action, whether the characters are together or continents apart. This is also the book&#x2019;s weakness, as Lore haphazardly inserts surprise attacks by the Mogs whenever the story needs a kick or a cliff-hanger. Thankfully, two characters emerge as especially interesting: Nine, the arrogant but capable rich kid traveling alongside stalwart Four; and Eight, who is tracked down in India, where locals believe him to be a reincarnated Vishnu. Increasingly, the teens&#x2019; exhausting amount of superpowers and weapons drains tension from their battles with the comparatively lackluster Mogs, but the pages do turn.

At least, that is Lady Xenobia India St. Clair&#x2019;s initial assessment when Thorn&#x2019;s stepmother, Eleanor, hires India to redecorate Starberry Court, the rundown country estate Thorn has recently purchased. Thorn is certain that his acquisition of Starberry Court will convince Laetitia Rainsford to accept his offer of marriage. India is equally convinced that if the ramshackle country estate doesn&#x2019;t scare Laetitia away, Thorn&#x2019;s own rough-around-the-edges appearance (not to mention his ancestry) will certainly do the trick. However, Eleanor is one of her dearest friends, and India has never yet backed down from a challenge. So, if all she has is three weeks to transform Starberry Court into a properly running home and turn Thorn into a civilized gentleman, India will just have to make it work.

His hosts hope that Mr. Hosokawa can be persuaded to build a factory in their Third World backwater. Alas, in the opening sequence, just as the accompanist kisses the soprano, a ragtag band of 18 terrorists enters the vice-presidential mansion through the air conditioning ducts. Their quarry is the president, who has unfortunately stayed home to watch a favorite soap opera. And thus, from the beginning, things go awry.Among the hostages are not only Hosokawa and Roxane Coss, the American soprano, but an assortment of Russian, Italian, and French diplomatic types. Reuben Iglesias, the diminutive and gracious vice president, quickly gets sideways of the kidnappers, who have no interest in him whatsoever. Meanwhile, a Swiss Red Cross negotiator named Joachim Messner is roped into service while vacationing. He comes and goes, wrangling over terms and demands, and the days stretch into weeks, the weeks into months.With the omniscience of magic realism, Ann Patchett flits in and out of the hearts and psyches of hostage and terrorist alike, and in doing so reveals a profound, shared humanity. Her voice is suitably lyrical, melodic, full of warmth and compassion. Hearing opera sung live for the first time, a young priest reflects:Never had he thought, never once, that such a woman existed, one who stood so close to God that God's own voice poured from her. How far she must have gone inside herself to call up that voice. It was as if the voice came from the center part of the earth and by the sheer effort and diligence of her will she had pulled it up through the dirt and rock and through the floorboards of the house, up into her feet, where it pulled through her, reaching, lifting, warmed by her, and then out of the white lily of her throat and straight to God in heaven.Joined by no common language except music, the 58 international hostages and their captors forge unexpected bonds. Time stands still, priorities rearrange themselves. Ultimately, of course, something has to give, even in a novel so imbued with the rich imaginative potential of magic realism.

        "0060837381": "Book DescriptionThe delightfulNew York Timesbestselling author returns with a hilarious novel about one woman's quest to redo an old house . . . and her life.After her boss in a high-powered Washington public relations firm is caught in a political scandal, fledgling lobbyist Dempsey Jo Killebrew is left almost broke, unemployed, and homeless. Out of options, she reluctantly accepts her father's offer to help refurbish Birdsong, the old family place he recently inherited in Guthrie, Georgia. All it will take, he tells her, is a little paint and some TLC to turn the fading Victorian mansion into a real-estate cash cow.But, oh, is Dempsey in for a surprise when she arrives in Guthrie. \"Bird Droppings\" would more aptly describe the moldering Pepto Bismol-pink dump with duct-taped windows and a driveway full of junk. There's also a murderously grumpy old lady, one of Dempsey's distant relations, who has claimed squatter's rights and isn't moving out. Ever.Furthermore, everyone in Guthrie seems to know Dempsey's business, from a smooth-talking real-estate agent to a cute lawyer who owns the local newspaper. It wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the pesky FBI agents who show up on Dempsey's doorstep, hoping to pry information about her ex-boss from her.All Dempsey can do is roll up her sleeves and get to work. And before long, what started as a job of necessity somehow becomes a labor of love and, ultimately, a journey that takes her to a place she never expected--back home again.Mary Kay Andrews's Top FivesWe caught up with Mary Kay Andrews, the prolific author ofThe Fixer Upper,Deep Dishand other bestselling Southern-fried romances, and learned about a few of her favorite things--from books to musicals to interior decorating tips (a passion of hers which plays a prominent role in her new book).Top Five BooksRebeccaby Daphne du MaurierVoid Moonby Michael ConnellyBig Stone Gapby  Adriana TrigianiCrazy for Youby Jennifer  CrusieGet Shortyby Elmore LeonardTop Five Movies/DVDsSabrina(the  original with Audrey Hepburn)Charade(again, the original  with Audrey Hepburn)When Harry Met SallyAuntie Mame(not the  gawdawful musical)The Quiet ManTop Five Movie MusicalsCamelotFunny GirlSouth PacificMy Fair LadyWest Side StoryTop Five Decorating BooksShabby Chicby Rachel AshwellA House in the  Southby Frances Schultz and Paula WallaceMary Emmerling's Beach  Cottagesby Mary EmmerlingMary Emmerling's American  Country Cottagesby Mary EmmerlingAn Affair with a Houseby  Bunny WilliamsTop Five Renovating TipsAn old  house needs old doors, hardware and fixtures. Nothing says &#x201C;new and cheap&#x201D; faster than a flimsy hollow-core  door and bright gold repro brass hardware. Look for solid wood doors and wood frame windows at salvage yards and antique  markets. And don&#x2019;t forget to check the &#x201C;building materials&#x201D; category on Craigslist. I got all the doors for my beach  house off Craigslist--for $5 apiece. Vintage hardware can frequently be found at flea markets, or check online sources  like eBay.Vintage light fixtures give a great look--but be sure you factor in the cost of re-wiring them, and finding  good-looking shades. Nothing gives a lamp that &#x201C;granny&#x201D; look faster than a dingy yellow shade.Before you invest in antique cast-iron claw-foot tubs or sinks, make sure they have proper fittings. Measure drains  and faucet spreads and make sure you can find new ones that will fit and function properly. Antique toilets are  generally a bad idea--most local codes require low-flow toilets for water conservation.Before re-wiring a house, put together a furniture floor plan. You don&#x2019;t want a heat register under the living room  sofa, but you will want outlets on either side of the bed for reading lamps, and for any area that might be used as an  office you&#x2019;ll want plenty of grounded plugs. And how about that flat-screen television your husband wants? Plan now for  cable locations.Be flexible. A great fireplace surround could become a headboard, as could an old paneled door--turned sideways.  And that leaded glass window that had to be removed in the remodel? Why not fit it with mirrors and a hinge and make it  into a bathroom medicine cabinet?Top Five Best Junking FindsPair of barrel-back armchairs--$30 at an estate sale. They were covered in gold embossed vinyl when I found &#x2018;em.  But with the legs stained ebony, and a gorgeous blue Ralph Lauren fabric reupholstery, they&#x2019;re perfect by my fireplace.Set of eight antique Wedgewood black and cream transferware plates--$30 at an estate sale. The seller&#x2019;s mother used  some of them for cat dishes, others as an ashtray!Vintage landscape oil painting, Tuscany maybe? Or Provence? Who cares! Bought at a &#x201C;divorce sale&#x201D;--the ex-husband  sold this beautiful painting for $50 because it had belonged to his ex-wife.  I spent a small fortune framing it, but it&#x2019;s the basis for a collection of treasured landscape paintings.Wicker settee, Salvation Army find for $25. I&#x2019;d walked to the store, and had to hoof it back home in a hurry for money and my car.Faux alligator train case--found at a yard sale. When I asked the seller if she&#x2019;d do better on the price, she replied that she&#x2019;d give it to me for free--if I could figure out how to open it. Since it had a combination lock like the one on my high school graduation luggage, I twirled the dial to 0-0-0--because I never figured out how to change mine--and sure enough, the lock popped open.

With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents.

        "0099452243": "The Cultural Revolution of Chairman Mao Zedong altered Chinese history in the 1960s and '70s, forcibly sending hundreds of thousands of Chinese intellectuals to peasant villages for \"re-education.\" This moving, often wrenching short novel by a writer who was himself re-educated in the '70s tells how two young men weather years of banishment, emphasizing the power of literature to free the mind. Sijie's unnamed 17-year-old protagonist and his best friend, Luo, are bourgeois doctors' sons, and so condemned to serve four years in a remote mountain village, carrying pails of excrement daily up a hill. Only their ingenuity helps them to survive. The two friends are good at storytelling, and the village headman commands them to put on \"oral cinema shows\" for the villagers, reciting the plots and dialogue of movies. When another city boy leaves the mountains, the friends steal a suitcase full of forbidden books he has been hiding, knowing he will be afraid to call the authorities. Enchanted by the prose of a host of European writers, they dare to tell the story of The Count of Monte Cristo to the village tailor and to read Balzac to his shy and beautiful young daughter. Luo, who adores the Little Seamstress, dreams of transforming her from a simple country girl into a sophisticated lover with his foreign tales. He succeeds beyond his expectations, but the result is not what he might have hoped for, and leads to an unexpected, droll and poignant conclusion. The warmth and humor of Sijie's prose and the clarity of Rilke's translation distinguish this slim first novel, a wonderfully human tale. (Sept. 17)Forecast: Sijie's debut was a best-seller and prize winner in France in 2000, and rights have been sold in 19 countries; it is also scheduled to be made into a film. Its charm translates admirably strong sales can be expected on this side of the Atlantic.Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

AndSonic Adventure, with its light-speed gameplay, is sure to wow even the most jaded gamer.It's amazing that such a small machine (it's about the size of your mouse pad) can deliver such incredible performance. Chalk it up to superior engineering. Dreamcast's only downside is that it comes with only one controller and a demo disc. In order to truly take advantage of Dreamcast's capabilities, we recommend outfitting the controller with a Jump Pack and a Visual Memory Unit. Getting one or more extra controllers is also a good idea, because some of the best Dreamcast games support up to four players at once.Why it's so cool:Ultramodern components:Custom-made video, audio, and processor technology blows away the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation and puts Dreamcast in the same league as PS2 and XBox.Integrated modem:In another video-game first, Dreamcast comes with a 56K modem. Use your regular Internet service provider and the separately sold keyboard to access e-mail, shopping, and the World Wide Web. Not only can you upload high scores, participate in chat discussions, and download updates and enhancements for your games, but, through a membership to the SegaNet Internet service provider, you can playQuake III Arena,NFL 2K1, and other games against Dreamcast owners over the Internet.The Visual Memory Unit (VMU):More than just a memory card, the VMU is a miniature portable game system that fits inside a controller--so its LCD screen is easily seen by you but hidden from your opponent.All-in-one entertainment:It plays games. It plays audio CDs. It connects to the Internet and lets you browse the Web or e-mail friends.

        "0061689246": "Stardustis an utterly charming fairy tale in the tradition ofThe Princess BrideandThe Neverending Story. Neil Gaiman, creator of the darkly elegant Sandman comics and author ofThe Day I Swapped My Dad for Two Goldfish, tells the story of young Tristran Thorn and his adventures in the land of Faerie. One fateful night, Tristran promises his beloved that he will retrieve a fallen star for her from beyond the Wall that stands between their rural English town (called, appropriately, Wall) and the Faerie realm. No one ever ventures beyond the Wall except to attend an enchanted flea market that is held every nine years (and during which, unbeknownst to him, Tristran was conceived). But Tristran bravely sets out to fetch the fallen star and thus win the hand of his love. His adventures in the magical land will keep you turning pages as fast as you can--he and the star escape evil old witches, deadly clutching trees, goblin press-gangs, and the scheming sons of the dead Lord of Stormhold. The story is by turns thrillingly scary and very funny. You'll love goofy, earnest Tristran and the talking animals, gnomes, magic trees, and other irresistible denizens of Faerie that he encounters in his travels.Stardustis a perfect read-aloud book, a brand-new fairy tale you'll want to share with a kid, or maybe hoard for yourself.

Mother and daughter have had a difficult, peripatetic life performing magic shows and conducting s&#xE9;ances, but when they land in New York City, they find a stable home and increasing fame (even Vanderbilts attend their performances). For Marguerite, it&#x2019;s a matter of being a good actress, but for 16-year-old Anna, there&#x2019;s more to it than sleight of hand, as she truly feels and sees things that are inexplicable, adding excitement and danger to their shows and lives. Regardless of whether this ability is a matter of pedigree or coincidence, it makes her a person of interest to suave young men, dangerous kidnappers, and the real-life Society for Psychical Research. Yet despite these promising details, the story&#x2019;s actual point is rather nebulous and blandly executed. Still, the 1920s elements of prohibition, automobiles, and cloche hats are interesting, and the timeless adolescent themes of self-definition, rebellion, and romance infuse the magic with a realism that may be comforting, if predictable.

All that remains is the search for the truth behind his betrayal and the survival of its consequences.The StoryDeceived by the forces of evil into prematurely bringing about the end of the world, War - the first Horseman of the Apocalypse - stands accused of breaking the sacred law by inciting a war between heaven and hell. Dishonored and stripped of his powers, War must return to Earth to search for the truth and punish those responsible. But there is no clear definition of good and evil in this tale. Hunted by a vengeful group of angels, War must take on the forces of Hell, forge uneasy alliances with the very demons he hunts, and journey across the ravaged remains of the Earth on his quest for vindication. But the answers he seeks will reveal a deep conspiracy in which War will find, and have to resign himself to the reality that although once the hand of God, he is just a pawn in the eternal battle between heaven and hell.GameplayA mix of exploration and fast-paced action gameplay,Darksidersis based on nonlinear play situations. That means that as War slowly regains his previous powers of destruction and carnage in order to continue his search for the origins and reasons for his betrayal, players will be able to backtrack to areas and scenarios that they may have left unexplored upon first discovery. Almost all areas of the game can be explored and some of the things players will find as they do so are treasure chests, health chests, and bonus life points, etc. The ability to go back and explore areas is important, especially as the game progresses and War finds himself up against enemies whose defeat require special skills and/or weaponry.As for combat gameplay,Darksidersfeatures a variety of weapons--including blades and firearms--that can be used in combo moves or in single strikes. Some of these can be charged up for quick, but devastating attacks on enemies and all can be arranged on your controller's D-pad for easy and preferred access. Additional gameplay elements include the ability/necessity to fight from the back of your mount, Ruin, and the collection of the souls in the form of glowing orbs that fall to the ground as enemies are dispatched. The latter can be used to level up War with new items and abilities.Varied Characters and EnvironmentsAlthough players take on the imposing role or War,Darksidersalso contains a wide variety of equally intriguing and sometimes frightening characters. These include: an assortment of vengeful angels; demons, such as \"the Jailer\" whose body is made up of the remains of countless cadavers; a bestiary of wicked and vile creatures created to bolster the armies of hell on Earth; and Ruin, the trusty steed of War. Gameplay environments players will experience are equally varied, and include areas both underground and on the surface, that call to mind both familiar, if ruined modern urban environments, as well as ones seemingly pulled from the nightmarish scenes of the biblical apocalypse.Key FeaturesApocalyptic Power of War- Unleash the wrath of War, combining brutal attacks and supernatural abilities to decimate all who stand in your way.Extreme Arsenal- Wield a devastating arsenal of angelic, demonic, and Earthly weapons, and blaze a trail of destruction atop Ruin, War's fiery phantom steed.Epic Quest- Battle across the wastelands and demon-infested dungeons of the decimated Earth in your quest for vengeance and redemption.Character Progression- Uncover powerful ancient relics, upgrade your weapons, unlock new abilities, and customize your gameplay style.Battle Heaven and Hell- Battle against all who stand in your way&mdash;from war-weary angelic forces to hell's hideous demon hordes.Weapons and Gear-Darksidersfeatures an extensive arsenal and inventory of weapons and gear.Varied Play Environments- Players will fight through varied environments, including those above and underground, and modern and nightmarishly mythical in design.PlayStation Network- Although a single player game,Darksidersfeatures PlayStation Network Trophy support and other features to heighten the gameplay experience.",

For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers.

        "0060510609": "Captain James Cook's three epic 18th-century explorations of the Pacific  Ocean were the last of their kind, literally completing the map of the world.  Yet despite his monumental discoveries, principally in the South Pacific, Cook  the man has remained an enigma. In retracing key legs of the circumnavigator's  journey, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Tony Horwitz chronicles the cultural  and environmental havoc wrought by the captain's opening of the unspoiled  Pacific to the West, as well as the alternately indifferent and passionate  reactions Cook's name evokes during the writer's journeys through Polynesia,  Australia, the Aleutians, and the explorer's native England. Horwitz skillfully  weaves a biography and travel narrative with warm humor that is natural and human-scale, and his restless inquisitiveness quickly infects the reader. While  striking dichotomies abound throughout that journey--Maori toughs who adopt Nazi  imagery to symbolize their own fight against white domination, millennia-old  Polynesian sexual mores that would shame the Reeperbahn, a sense that  Christianity decimated native cultures at least as effectively as Western  venereal diseases did--few are more poignant than the ones that abound in Cook's  own life. This fine work is an adventurous reminder that answers to historical  riddles are elusive at best--and seldom as compelling as the myriad new  questions they pose.--Jerry McCulley--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

Citing Plato, Buddha and modern brain science, psychologist Haidt notes the mind is like an \"elephant\" of automatic desires and impulses atop which conscious intention is an ineffectual \"rider.\" Haidt sifts Eastern and Western religious and philosophical traditions for other nuggets of wisdom to substantiate&mdash;and sometimes critique&mdash;with the findings of neurology and cognitive psychology. The Buddhist-Stoic injunction to cast off worldly attachments in pursuit of happiness, for example, is backed up by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's studies into pleasure. And Nietzsche's contention that what doesn't kill us makes us stronger is considered against research into post-traumatic growth. An exponent of the \"positive psychology\" movement, Haidt also offers practical advice on finding happiness and meaning. Riches don't matter much, he observes, but close relationships, quiet surroundings and short commutes help a lot, while meditation, cognitive psychotherapy and Prozac are equally valid remedies for constitutional unhappiness. Haidt sometimes seems reductionist, but his is an erudite, fluently written, stimulating reassessment of age-old issues.(Jan.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0060738170": "Starred Review.In the absence of any original manuscripts of the books of the New Testament, how can we be sure that we're getting the intended words and meaning? Ehrman, professor of religion at UNC&ndash;Chapel Hill, has devoted his life to the study of such questions and here offers an engaging and fascinating look at the way scholars try to answer them. Part memoir, part history and part critical study, he traces the development of the academic discipline called textual criticism, which uses external and internal evidence to evaluate and compare ancient manuscripts in order to find the best readings. Ehrman points out that scribes altered almost all of the manuscripts we now have. In the early days of the Christian movement, scribal error often arose simply from unintentional omissions of words or lines. As Christianity evolved into an official religion under Constantine, however, scribes often added material to existing manuscripts or altered them to provide scriptural support for Christian doctrine or to enforce specific views about women, Jews or pagans. Ehrman's absorbing story, fresh and lively prose and seasoned insights into the challenges of recreating the texts of the New Testament ensure that readers might never read the Gospels or Paul's letters the same way again.(Nov.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Following a botched circumcision, a family is convinced to raise their infant son, Bruce, as a girl. They rename the child Brenda and spend the next 14 years trying to transform him into a her. Brenda's childhood reads as one filled with anxiety and loneliness, and her fear and confusion are present on nearly every page concerning her early childhood. Much of her pain is caused by Dr. Money, who is presented as a villainous medical man attempting to coerce an unwilling child to submit to numerous unpleasant treatments.Reading over interviews and reports of decisions made by this doctor, it's difficult to contain anger at the widespread results of his insistence that natural-born gender can be altered with little more than willpower and hormone treatments. The attempts of his parents, twin brother, and extended family to assist Brenda to be happily female are touching--the sense is overwhelmingly of a family wanting to do \"right\" while being terribly mislead as to what \"right\" is for her. As Brenda makes the decision to live life as a male (at age 14), she takes the name David and begins the process of reversing the effects of estrogen treatments. David's ultimately successful life--a solid marriage, honest and close family relationships, and his bravery in making his childhood public--bring an uplifting end to his story. Equally fascinating is the latest segment of the longtime nature/nurture controversy, and the interviews of various psychological researchers and practitioners form a larger framework around David's struggle to live as the gender he was meant to be.--Jill Lightner",

Setting her sights considerably higher, Hubbard profiles the royal court of Queen Victoria. Instead of opting for an upstairs-downstairs peek, she profiles a half-dozen ladies and gentlemen of the household, midlevel employees who, while not strictly in service, were called upon to provide a variety of services&#x2014;often indefinitely&#x2014;to Her Majesty. Utilizing the diaries and letters of Victoria&#x2019;s maid of honor, two ladies-of-the-bedchamber, her secretary, her physician, and her chaplain, Hubbard has painted a portrait of the duty, dedication, and discretion that were required of the &#xAD;middle-class members of a surprisingly dull and decidedly unglamorous court. Despite a lack of scandal and juicy behind-the-scenes gossip, this is a historically fascinating depiction of Victoria&#x2019;s domestic routine and retinue. --Margaret Flanagan",

        "0062107968": "*Starred Review* Nora Cunningham brings her daughters to Burke&#x2019;s Island in New England to escape the scandal surrounding her politician husband&#x2019;s affair. Her aunt Maire is thrilled, but not all of the residents are so welcoming. The silence surrounding the long-ago disappearance of Maeve, Nora&#x2019;s mother, not to mention the sudden appearance of a shipwrecked man with no memory, is a dark current propelling the story forward. Ella, Nora&#x2019;s 12-year-old, misses her father fiercely, but 7-year-old Annie is drawn to the sea and, especially, a strange young boy named Ronan. The writing elevates this story above the usual wronged-mother-finds-herself story, and the harsh and, in the right hands, productive island is a character in itself. Readers who require strict realism may be turned off by the touch of the paranormal, but Barbieri does such a wonderful job setting up the beauty and mystery of the island and its rich Gaelic roots that it is not a stretch to ask the reader to imagine that the place is also magical. A wonderful, subtle, transporting story. For readers who enjoyed Sarah Addison Allen&#x2019;s Garden Spells (2007) and Brunonia Barry&#x2019;s The Lace Reader (2008). --Susan Maguire",

Armentrout). After five hellish years of being called a lying whore in her small Texas town, 19-year-old Avery Morgansten is more than happy to leave for college in West Virginia. There she meets gorgeous, blue-eyed Cameron Hamilton, a fellow student who seems as attracted to her as she is to him. Haunted by her traumatic past, Avery is torn between protecting herself and finding love. The path to romance is long and rocky, and Cam has dark secrets of his own, but eventually both lovers come clean and all loose ends are neatly wrapped up. While Lynn's peripheral characters are fairly one-dimensional, Avery and Cam are compelling. Fans of stories about characters healed by love will find this one moderately satisfying.

        "B00009WAUK": "You can almost hear the collective drooling of RPG and Game Boy fans worldwide. As the inaugural Nintendo/Square reunion title,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancehas a lot to live up to--and it does, spectacularly!The long heralded Final Fantasy series has enjoyed a number of spin-offs and sequels. Using the familiar character types and classes of the Final Fantasy series, but with a wholly original storyline,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancecreates an immersive world of strategic combat and conquest.Snow JobWhile most fantasy games favor romantic landscapes,Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceslyly starts out in a plain-vanilla suburb. Players assume the role of young Marche Radiuju in the humble burg of St. Ivalice.A snowball fight introduces the characters and sets the groundwork for future battles. After a brief (but chilly) skirmish, Marche heads home to visit his younger brother.Marche MadnessSoon after, Marche's friends drop by to show him an ancient book of mysterious origins. After failing to translate the text properly, Marche's friends leave for the evening. After a wistful slumber, Marche awakens and realizes he isn't in Ivalice anymore... or is he?Alone in a foreign land, Marche quickly comes under the care of a helpful creature known as a Moogle. It doesn't take much to convince Marche to adopt a lucrative career as a mercenary.Gangs of IvaliceA quick stop at the town inn introduces Marche to his new gang. A motley crew at best, your associates include low-level monks, mages, archers, and soldiers. The only hope you have of finding your way home is to turn your ragtag group of misfits into a finely tuned fighting force.Begin your tour of duty by chatting up the local barkeep. He'll clue you in to interesting news bits, rumors, and job opportunities. Due to your severe lack of experience, early quests are little more than errands.As you gain experience and reputation, your job options grow as well as the rewards. You can also send one of your crew members on side missions for extra swag. You cannot use these members in your regular quests until they return from their mission.Rules of EngagementWhether your quest is to fetch rare herbs or escort the local nobleman, you can always expect bad company. The battlefield is set up from an isometric 3D viewpoint, allowing clear view of every character in play.At the start of a match, you must choose which members of your gang you wish to take into battle with you. You have a clear view of the enemies before choosing, so try to match your lineup to your opposition.Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceintroduces an innovative law system to the series. During every battle, an impartial judge decrees specific rules, such as banning poison attacks or physical attacks. The judges' unpredictability requires players to keep a well-rounded group of characters at all times.Technically, you can break the combat laws, but it is generally not recommended. Even if you win the battle, any of your characters who breaks a law is whisked away to prison. They can only be released after paying a hefty fine.Fantasy FightingThe battlefield is set up like a 3D chessboard, with elevations and terrain types. In each turn, a character can move a specific number of spaces and perform a single action, such as attack or using an item.Most strategy games employ either real-time or turn-based action.Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceemploys a speed-based system that is somewhere in-between.Characters still take turns to move and perform actions, but these are based on each character's individual speed ratings. Nimble characters like rogues and ninjas are usually the first characters to go and can usually move farther than other characters. The downside is that faster characters typically lack strong armor and health stats.Subtle details such as terrain type and attack proximity can have a direct affect on your ability to hit an enemy. Attacking an enemy from behind or the side will yield much higher hit percentages than head-on attacks.Job FairWhat you do off the battlefield is arguably more important than what you do on it. Thanks to a stable economy, your characters can usually change job classes once they gain enough experience.Need a little more magic in your life? Try turning one of your grunts into a mage. There are more than 30 different job classes available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.Even in far-off fantasy lands, commercialism is a way of life. You'll be amazed at how quickly you'll end up spending your hard-earned greenbacks on shiny new stuff. Weapons and armor serve not only to boost your stats, but also grant special abilities to specific character types and species.While one sword might grant tremendous attack points, a seemingly lesser sword may give its wielder access to a special attack that can tip the scales in your favor. Thanks to the law system, one should never get too attached to a single piece of equipment.Face ValueGorgeous character illustrations and 2D sprites harken back to Square's 16-bit glory days. Each of the shops, inns, towns, and fields is superbly detailed, with subtle background animations.Final Fantasy Tactics Advancemaintains the series' stellar rep for technically and visually brilliant summon attacks.Uniquely,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancefeatures three separate display settings, depending on whether you're playing on the Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Advance SP, or the Game Boy Player. Each setting offers different levels of brightness, contrast, and saturation to appease even the most fickle of gamers.The only thing that can rival the on-screen wonders is the audio candy. It is no surprise why Square Enix's soundtracks are the most sought-after in the video game community.Lasting PowerNeedless to say, there are hours upon hours of gameplay packed into this tiny little cartridge. Square Enix has done a tremendous job in creating an easily accessible yet incredibly deep gameplay experience.

In it we find our obsessive-compulsive heroine, Catherine Bailey, checking and rechecking her door locks six times, eschewing red clothing, shopping only on certain days--clearly something horrible has happened, and Haynes masterfully teases out the disturbing details, which involve a Jekyll and Hyde boyfriend. As the story unfolds, it provides subtle insight into why, despite red flags and bruises, someone would stay in an abusive relationship, and it makes you root for Catherine all the more to overcome the psychological fallout. If you're a fan of cinematic showdowns, you won't be disappointed. But the quietly powerful moments in Haynes' narrative resonate even more, as she illustrates that one of the bravest things someone can do is lock the door behind her, maybe five or six times, and step out into an uncertain world again.--Erin Kodicek",

When Walter discovers the relationship, he compels Kitty to accompany him to a cholera-infested region of mainland China, where she finds limited happiness working with children at a convent. But when Walter dies, she is forced to leave China and return to England. Generally abandoned, she grasps desperately for the affection of her one remaining relative, her long-ignored father. In the end, in sharp, unexamined contrast to her own behavior patterns, she asserts that her unborn daughter will grow up to be an independent woman. The Painted Veil was first published in 1925 and is usually described as a strong story about a woman's spiritual journey. To more pragmatic, modern eyes, Kitty's emotional growth appears minimal. Still, if not a major feminist work, the book has literary interest. Sophie Ward's uninflected reading is competent if not compelling. Recommended only for large literature collections. I.

It took just an hour and a half to wipe out 3.5 billion people and 10,000 years of civilization, plunging humanity into a hopeless Dark Age. In the aftermath, survivors in Moscow moved underground and slowly organized into small socially and politically independent tribes, clustered around the city's deep, subway stations. The young man, Artyom is among them. A member of the first generation of children raised in the subterranean world following the apocalypse, he has only the vaguest recollections of life above ground, and contact with other humans beyond those that inhabit his local station, \"Exhibition,\" but he will have to face new experiences with both if humanity is to survive. Mutated beasts known as \"Dark Ones\" are spreading throughout the isolated stations of the Metro, and Artyom has been chosen as the messenger to spread the news of the new peril.",

He has been nominated for both the Hugo and the Campbell Award and has won two Parsec Awards for his podcastWriting Excuses. Robison Wells, Dan&rsquo;s younger brother, is the author ofVariant, whichPublishers Weeklycalled &ldquo;a chilling, masterful debut&rdquo; in a starred review, and its sequel,Feedback(available Fall 2012). Here, Robison interviews his brother aboutPartials, Dan&rsquo;s pulse-pounding first book in his post-apocalyptic series that questions the very concept of what it means to be human.Robison:Dan is my brother, exactly 13 months older than me. He and I shared a room our entire childhood, took the same classes, even dated the same girls. Dan got me into writing about twelve years ago, and ever since we&rsquo;ve critiqued each other&rsquo;s work, brainstormed new ideas, and told each other how terrible he is. So, with such a long background together, I&rsquo;m particularly interested to see if I can learn anything new in this interview.I&rsquo;ve read so much of your writing over the years, from your poem about turkeys in the fifth grade to your first epic fantasy to your literary farce to your horror, and now your YA post-apocalyptic Partials. Is there anything you&rsquo;ve written that I&rsquo;d be surprised to hear about?Dan:I wrote someRiftsfan fiction in high school&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know if you knew about that. I actually reused a part of it forPartials.Robison:What part?Dan:I won&rsquo;t say, but it&rsquo;s in the first third.Robison:You&rsquo;ve written in all these different genres: Is it because you&rsquo;re still looking for the perfect fit? Or are you just interested in writing lots of different things?Dan:Almost every book I write is a new genre, or a weird combination of genres, because I like to branch out and try new things. I never would have imagined that I&rsquo;d write a horror series, but that was the first book I published. I never would have found that character, or the audience that loves him, if I&rsquo;d forced myself to stick to one thing.Robison:How was the transition from supernatural to sci-fi?Dan:Not too bad, since I see them as very connected&mdash;the only real difference between fantasy and SF is the explanation of where the weird stuff comes from. SF ended up being a lot harder, in some ways, because I had to make those explanations scientifically sound. In my horror series I could just say, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a monster!&rdquo; With SF I had to do a ton of research into genetics, biology, and the science of decay.Robison:How did you do your research?Dan:A lot of my research started online, including Wikipedia&mdash;people make fun of it as a research tool, and I admit that it&rsquo;s a terrible place to end your research, but it&rsquo;s a fantastic place to start. From there I found more detailed websites, and eventually some great connections to books. One of the most useful books I read wasThe World Without Usby Alan Weisman, about what would happen to the things we leave behind if we suddenly weren&rsquo;t there to take care of them. It&rsquo;s a very detailed combination of scientific research and thought experiment.InPartials, the apocalypse wasn&rsquo;t a bomb or a war or anything physically destructive, just a disease: We died, but all our stuff is still just sitting there. It was a fun situation to study, and a blast to depict in a book.Robison:So, having done all that research, what tips would you give for surviving an apocalyptic pandemic? Let&rsquo;s assume you&rsquo;re immune to the virus.Dan:I don&rsquo;t know how you&rsquo;re going to work that out, but there you go. Once you have that taken care of, you live in a combination of paradise and medieval squalor. You will have no electricity or running water, but almost everything else will be free. Canned food can last for a decade or more before going bad, so you can live at a subsistence level just by scavenging the local stores.Robison:Why do you think your society of survivors ended up being organized and civil and less Mad Max-ish?Dan:A big part of it is the scarcity issue. Mad Max and similar apocalyptic scenarios start with the premise that everything is destroyed. The survivors have to fight tooth and nail for what little resources are left. InPartials, everything you could ever want is just there for the taking.Robison:What books/movies/music/TV influencedPartials?Dan:Some of the influences are obvious, likeBattlestar GalacticaandChildren of Men. Others are harder to spot. I listened to a steady diet of protest songs and revolutionary music while writing, stuff like &ldquo;Uprising&rdquo; by Muse, because they got my blood going and helped me get into the main character&rsquo;s fiery personality. And some of my influences didn&rsquo;t really end up in the book, though I still count them&mdash;things likeMad MaxandA Canticle for Leibowitzthat inspired my love of post-apocalyptic stories, but which didn&rsquo;t really apply in this case.The biggest influence may have been our own history and current events.Partialsis, at times, a very angry book, and that&rsquo;s a reflection of my own feelings about a lot of the stuff I see going on in the world.Robison:Let&rsquo;s talk about that. You&rsquo;ve said before that you think one of the reasons dystopia is so popular right now is because our world is becoming more dystopian. What current events influenced you inPartials?Dan:For example, the story is set eleven years after a devastating catastrophe&mdash;and in 2012, my readers are also eleven years after their own devastating catastrophe. The events of 9/11 changed the way we do almost everything in this country, and to a lesser extent the rest of the world. One of the things I tried to do in the book was show that the adults, who remember what life was like before the end of the world, have a very different attitude about it than the kids who&rsquo;ve never really known any other life.I also tried to throw in a lot of the extreme measures our government and our culture in general have taken in response to terrorism&mdash;reduced privacy, indefinite detention, torture, and so on. I think there are arguments on both sides of all these issues, and I tried to give each side a fair shake. Kira, the main character, has very strong ideas about what&rsquo;s justifiable and what&rsquo;s not, and just because she&rsquo;s the main character doesn&rsquo;t mean she&rsquo;s always right. If anyone&rsquo;s actually &ldquo;right&rdquo; at all.Robison:So, on a happier note, why do you think I&rsquo;m so awesome?Dan:Because you take after your brother.",

In this book, the focus is on his neighbor Tom Hartwig, a man who has lived 82 years in one farmhouse in rural Wisconsin, on a farm that survived the construction of a four-lane interstate in its front yard in 1965. Tom, known for his hobby of building and occasionally firing cannons, offers pearls of wisdom on everything from living with whizzing traffic outside your kitchen window, to repairing tools ranging from massive farm equipment to shovel handles, to raising daughters. Perry relates his own farm life, including realizing that taking his daughter to swim in the local creek is more important than deadlines and appreciating the pleasure of odd tools as he sharpens a scythe (only to be told very matter-of-factly by Tom that a gas-powered weed whacker is better).

Along the way, Serge delivers rough justice in inventive and bizarre fashion (death by garage door, by bridge guitar, etc.) to a mugger, a rude driver, and various others guilty of minor infractions.

        "0060558288": "Secular liberals and religious conservatives will find things to both comfort and alarm them in Jim Wallis'sGod's Politics. That combination is actually reason enough to recommend the book in a time when the national political and theological discourse is dominated by blanket descriptions and shortsightedness. But Wallis, editor ofSojournersmagazine, offers more than just a book that's hard to categorize. What Wallis sees as the true mission of Christianity--righting social ills, working for peace--is in tune with the values of liberals who so often run screaming from the idea of religion. Meanwhile, in his estimation, religious vocabulary is co-opted by conservatives who use it to polarize. Wallis proposes a new sort of politics, the name of which serves as the title of the book, wherein these disparities are reconciled and progressive causes are paired with spiritual guidance for the betterment of society. Wallis is at his most compelling when he puts this theory into action himself, letting his own beliefs guide him through stinging criticisms of the war in Iraq. In his view, George W. Bush's flaw lies in the assumption that the United States was an unprecedented force of goodness in a fight against enemies characterized as \"evil.\" Indeed, although both the right and left are criticized here, the idea is that the liberals, if they would get religion, are the more redeemable lot. Wallis's line between religion and public policy may be drawn a little differently than most liberals might feel comfortable with, and while he pays some lip service to other faiths most of his prescription for America seems to come from the Bible. Still, for a party having just lost a presidential election where \"moral issues\" are said to have factored heavily,God's Politicsis a sermon worth listening to.--John Moe",

With the help of an included key, the Expansion Pak fits into the slot that is below a removable panel on the top of the N64 console. Game developers can take advantage of the increased memory in several ways, including making games that are more visually appealing. Some games will allow players to choose a \"high-resolution\" option, increasing the screen resolution from 320 by 240 pixels to as much as 640 by 480 pixels--creating crisp, high-definition graphics. The Expansion Pak utilizes Nintendo 64's capability for 32-bit, 16.7-million-color display with 256 levels of transparency (alpha)--bringing your games to a new level of realism. Instead of reusing texture data, games can buffer a larger number of textures for a more distinct look.Other ways for developers to utilize the larger memory is by setting a higher frame rate, longer replays, and more animations. Games also can have more sophisticated artificial intelligence, which allows computer-controlled characters to be smarter, literally. Games can offer more characters and vehicles, and contain larger, more complex levels and worlds.

Cooper was 10 years old when his father, Wyatt Cooper, died during heart bypass surgery. He was 20 when his beloved older brother, Carter, committed suicide by jumping off his mother's penthouse balcony (his mother, by the way, being Gloria Vanderbilt). The losses profoundly affected Cooper, who fled home after college to work as a freelance journalist for Channel One, the classroom news service. Covering tragedies in far-flung places like Burma, Vietnam, and Somalia, Cooper quickly learned that \"as a journalist, no matter ... how respectful you are, part of your brain remains focused on how to capture the horror you see, how to package it, present it to others.\" Cooper's description of these horrors, from war-ravaged Baghdad to famine-wracked Niger, is poignant but surprisingly unsentimental. In Niger, Cooper writes, he is chagrined, then resigned, when he catches himself looking for the \"worst cases\" to commit to film. \"They die, I live. It's the way of the world,\" he writes. In the final section ofDispatches, Cooper describes covering Hurricane Katrina, the story that made him famous. The transcript of his showdown with Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu (in which Cooper tells Landrieu people in New Orleans are \"ashamed of what is happening in this country right now\") is worth the price of admission on its own. Cooper's memoir leaves some questions unanswered--there's frustratingly little about his personal life, for example--but remains a vivid, modest self-portrait by a man who is proving himself to be an admirable, courageous leader in a medium that could use more like him. --Erica C.

        "0060594667": "Product DescriptionEdgar Award-winning author Tom Franklin returns with his most accomplished and resonant novel so far&#x2014;an atmospheric drama set in rural Mississippi. In the late 1970s, Larry Ott and Silas \"32\" Jones were boyhood pals. Their worlds were as different as night and day: Larry, the child of lower-middle-class white parents, and Silas, the son of a poor, single black mother. Yet for a few months the boys stepped outside of their circumstances and shared a special bond. But then tragedy struck: Larry took a girl on a date to a drive-in movie, and she was never heard from again. She was never found and Larry never confessed, but all eyes rested on him as the culprit. The incident shook the county&#x2014;and perhaps Silas most of all. His friendship with Larry was broken, and then Silas left town.More than twenty years have passed. Larry, a mechanic, lives a solitary existence, never able to rise above the whispers of suspicion. Silas has returned as a constable. He and Larry have no reason to cross paths until another girl disappears and Larry is blamed again. And now the two men who once called each other friend are forced to confront the past they've buried and ignored for decades.A Q&amp;A with Author Tom FranklinQ:Tell us a bit about your latest bookCrooked Letter, Crooked Letter. How did you come up with the title?Franklin:Title's a pneumonic device used to teach children (mostly southern children) how to spell Mississippi.  M, I, crooked-letter, crooked-letter, I, crooked-letter, crooked-letter, I, humpback, humback, I.Q:Crooked Letter, Crooked Letteris a bit of a departure from your previous two novels&#x2014;SmonkandHell at the Breech&#x2014;in that it is set in contemporary times and the story line is a bit less dark. What inspired the premise for this novel and the departure from a more historical setting?Franklin:I'd been wanting to write about a small town police officer, and I'd long had the image of a loner mechanic in my mind.  When I put the two together, the story began to form.  I used a lot of autobiographical stuff for Larry, the mechanic.Q:A review inUSA Today(forHell at the Breech) stated that, &#x201C;he also makes his characters rise up from the pages as if they were there with you.&#x201D; &#x2026;and this is certainly true in your latest novel. How do you approach the task of developing your characters and bringing them to life? Are the characters inCrooked Letter, Crooked Letterbased on anyone in particular?Franklin:They're both a combination of different facets of different people, a conglomeration of fact and fiction.  I usually try to just let them begin to do what they want to do, just put them in a situation and see what they do.  When they begin to surprise me, do things I hadn't anticipated, that's when it's working.But the character of Silas \"32\" Jones is very loosely based on the sole police officer of the hamlet of Dickinson, Alabama, where I grew up.  This guy was actually the law in a nearby mill town, and my hamlet of Dickinson fell in his tiny jurisdiction.  I've always loved the idea of small town cops, especially one who might be a kind of underdog to the police forces of nearby larger towns.Q:InCrooked Letter, Crooked Letteryour two main characters are anything but stereotypical&#x2014;the young black boy goes off to college to play baseball and comes back to be the town constable and the young white boy is the accused murderer and the town outcast. What, if anything, prompted you to portray these characters this way?Franklin:No real person is a stereotype, and I try to make my characters as real as I can.  We're all a mess of contradictions and secrets, strangenesses and desires, and nobody's all good or all bad.  We're all somewhere in the spectrum between absolute good and absolute evil.  So I just try to find a character who's fairly normal, and put him or her in a fix and see how he or she negotiates it to see, as Kurt Vonnegut says, what he or she is made of. In this case, the story as I came to understand it called for Larry to stay home and Silas to leave.  If it had been the other way around, I'd still work to make the characters unstereotypical.Q:Without giving away too much of the story, what is one thing (emotion, thought) that readers can expect to walk away with after reading this book?Franklin:It's a sad book, but it's full of hope.  Hope is what I want a reader to leave with.Q:Historically the South has not always had a positive image in other parts of the country. How has your experience growing up and living in the rural South shaped your talent as a writer? And have you ever felt the need to justify or redeem the South&#x2019;s past in any of your works?Franklin:I think growing up in the south made me the person I am, and the writer I am comes from that.  So, yes, the south's made me the writer I am.  It taught me to listen to the cadences and rhythms of speech, and to notice the landscape.  It also has this defeated feel, a lingering of old sin, that makes it sweet in a rotting kind of way.  Much of it is poor, much is rural, and that's an interesting combination, a deep well for stories.Q:Did you always know that you wanted to be a writer? Who are some writers, past and present, that you admire or have inspired you?Franklin:I always knew I wanted to tell stories, one way or another.  If I'd had a video camera in the mid 1970s I'm sure I'd be a filmmaker now.  But I just had a portable typewriter, and so the stories I could tell were ones on paper.Q:You are one of the most celebrated writers in the field, and have been compared to the likes ofHarper Lee,William Faulkner, andElmore Leonard.  What do you believe is the one thing that sets you apart from other contemporary writers in your genre?Franklin:What sets me apart?  I honestly don't know that I&#x2019;m more \"apart\" from other writers of my generation.  Landscape plays a large role in what I write, but that's true of many other writers.  My stuff is set in the south, but that's true of others as well.  I don't know, honestly.Q:As a professor of English, what is one piece of advice that you would share with aspiring writers?Franklin:Read, starting with the classics.  Read all the time.  If you don't read, you won't ever be a writer.  Also, write.  This seems obvious, but it's amazing how many \"writers\" don't write very much.",
        "0062291408": "*Starred Review* In her last novel, Maya&#x2019;s Notebook (2013), Allende illuminated a criminal underworld. Now she nimbly joins her detective novelist husband, William C. Gordon, in writing crime fiction. Given her signature combination of bewitching imagination and social gravitas, Allende creates a compassionate and gripping mystery stoked by the paradoxes of family and community and the consequences of abuse. Super-smart high-school senior Amanda Mart&#xED;n is obsessed with an Internet role-playing game, Ripper (as in Jack), and oversees a group comprising four other brilliant misfit teens from around the world as well as her grandfather, who raised her after her very young parents divorced. Amanda&#x2019;s father, Bob, is a deputy chief of homicide in the San Francisco police department. Her mother, Indiana, is a healer too kind for her own good who is romantically entangled with a former navy SEAL and a wealthy dilettante. As Amanda and her cyber-brigade investigate a series of ritualistic murders no one else believes are connected, Allende richly portrays a range of intriguing characters, from Ayani, a famous Ethiopian model and women&#x2019;s rights activist, to Attila, a heroic war dog.

Yet the 320GB system manages to improve on this with its 45nm version of the processor, which although running at the same 60+nm speed as previous PS3 versions, uses less energy. This makes the unit's smaller size and quieter fan possible. Along with the traditional AV and composite connections, the 320GB system also boasts an HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) port, which delivers uncompressed, unconverted digital picture and sound to compatible high-definition TVs and projectors (the system is capable of 128-bit pixel precision and 1080p resolution for a full HD experience). This console also provides for an extreme sound experience by supporting Dolby Digital 5.1, DTS 5.1, as well as Linear PCM 7.1. Finally, it features cross connectivity with your PC network and PlayStation Portable (PSP) and its pre-installed, 320GB hard disc drive allows you to save games as well as download content from the internet. Unlike other models of the PlayStation 3, The 320GB system does not offer backwards compatibility.",
        "0060755784": "A dysfunctional New England family struggles toward normalcy in this poignant novel from PEN/Hemingway-winner Haigh, who follows the children of resentful, controlling, Paulette and distracted, needy Frank. Even during a childhood in idyllic Cape Cod, there are hints of a rocky future. When that future arrives, Billy, the most successful of the children, keeps a secret about his sophisticated New York life from almost everyone. Scott, formerly the uncontrollable brat of the bunch, sees himself in his own troubled son. Meanwhile, Gwen suffers from a genetic condition that prevents her from developing into womanhood. The story starts slowly, and while the setup feels familiar (a fractured New England family), the children take unexpected turns that shake up the narrative, leading to the most surprising twist of all: despite the sobering events chronicled, there's a strong nod to the healing power of love. Haigh allows the reader to sympathize with each of the family members, and, in turn, to see their flaws and better understand them.(June)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "B00007LVJD": "InCommand & Conquer: Generalsgamers choose from three radically different fighting forces, build an army from the ground up, and seek out and destroy opposing players' armies and bases. Your three choices are the USA, the Chinese, and the Global Liberation Army (a group of freedom fighters/terrorists). Each force has unique strengths and weaknesses; Generals does a good job making the three forces differ in more than aesthetics. The USA has costly but technically advanced units along with a stunningly powerful Air Force, the Chinese have weak but cheap ground units that gain advantages when attacking in large groups, and the GLA has a ramshackle army that relies on stealth. Each force caters to a completely different style of play, and playing around to find the group that you'll like the most is a lot of fun.One of the game&#x92;s most important innovations is the Generals point system. This system allows both the player and his units to gain experience points for each enemy kill. Experienced units will become hardier and more dangerous, and the player will gain points to spend on new technologies or special attacks. Each force has its own selection of bonuses you can purchase in this manner, and more experienced generals have access to increasingly powerful items.Generalsis the first title in the Command & Conquer franchise to go fully 3-D, and it looks absolutely gorgeous. All of the models and environments in the game look really good, and it's both cool and useful to rotate the camera around to get different perspectives on the battlefield.  The tradeoff here is thatGeneralshas extremely high system requirements, and you're going to have to go evenhigherthan the posted minimum if you want consistently smooth gaming performance. In fact, you're probably going to have noticeable slowdowns if you're not running approximately the equivalent of a 1.5GHZ processor and a GeForce 3 or better.Ever since the release of the firstCommand & Conquergame in 1995, the C&C; franchise has practically defined real-time strategy gaming.  With a half dozen original titles and a handful of expansion packs released on a multitude of gaming platforms, any new C&C; game has some seriously large boots to fill.  Fortunately for gamers,Command & Conquer: Generalshas not only met those previous expectations, but raised the bar once again.--Jon \"Safety Monkey\" GroverPros:Great looking, fully 3-D graphicsAll 3 races are fun, yet fully distinct from each otherInnovative Generals point systemFun single-player campaigns; exciting multiplayer over Internet or LANCons:Very high system requirements",

        "B00006F7S8": "It's hard to believe that creator Will Wright had trouble selling his originalSimCityconcept to publishers. That first game went on to fame, notoriety, and great praise--from critics, gamers, and even educators--and spawned countless imitators, not the least of which include Wright's own smaller-scaleThe Sims, which went on to become a phenomenon in its own right. Now on its fourth edition,SimCityreturns to our hard drives, and would-be city planners everywhere will be busy for a long, long time.SimCity 4functions much like its predecessors. You've got the power to zone land as residential (green), commercial (blue), and industrial (yellow). You control the budget. You decide where to place crucial services like police, fire, medical, and even utilities like power and water. You place schools, parks, roads, water towers, and scenery as you accede to the many demands of your Sim citizens. Do a good job and your city will grow and the money will flow into your coffers. Do a bad job and the people will pack up and move away, leaving your city treasury in horrific debt and landing you what the game cheekily considers to be a far easier job: senator. The game requires a balancing act that takes both planning and a persnickety nature. There are charts to read, reports to watch, and, above all, needs to juggle. It's rewarding when it all comes together, and frustrating when you fail, once again, to build anything worthwhile.That's why I wish the game came with a better manual. The included book glosses over most major information and then neglects important aspects, such as the RCI indicator (which explains zoning needs) and parts of the budget. At the very least, the manual should include tips on handling debt. There are two tutorials which cover the basics, but again, they won't help you get out of trouble once you get in too deep. You can find this information in thestrategy guide, which is sold separately, but you really shouldn't have to go that route.The graphics are amazing, showing a vibrant metropolis with scurrying traffic, wandering Sims, smoking chimneys, and sparkling lights when night falls. Fireworks reward each year of service. And wait until you see the cool disasters you can unleash if the mood strikes you--fire, lightning, tornado, volcano, and giant robot. Oddly, there's a significant performance hit even on fast systems. Thankfully, the stuttery scrolling and slow-to-respond zoom don't hurt the game too much since you can pause it at will or fast forward if you need to wait for your cash reserves to build. The most significant flaw is that the game only offers one save slot, which discourages experimentation.Despite minor imperfectionsSimCity 4is an awesome game. You can build several cities next to each other on the map and make them dependant on each other. (You can build the greater L.A. area, in other words.) You can even import your Sims fromThe Simsto live in your city. Such familiar characters can tell you a lot about what your city needs. Put simply, city planning has never been this fun, this challenging, or this deep.--Andrew S.

He's shocked to find himself in the stronghold of a widespread \"invisible\" network, organized into cells much like Ivenwald, and populated by elite, politically ambitious fundamentalists; Sharlet is present when a leader tells a dozen men living there, \"You guys are here to learn how to rule the world.\" As it turns out, the Family was established in 1935 to oppose FDR's New Deal and the spread of trade unions; since then, it has organized well-attended weekly prayer meetings for members of Congress and annual National Prayer Breakfasts attended by every president since Eisenhower. Further, the Family's international reach (\"almost impossible to overstate\") has \"forged relationships between the U.S. government and some of the most oppressive regimes in the world.\" In the years since his first encounter, Sharlet has done extensive research, and his thorough account of the Family's life and times is a chilling expose.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Victoria Moore, Daily Mail The Bronze Horseman 'Pulling off the passionate love story embedded in a truly epic narrative is a difficult thing to do. Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind remains the blueprint for the genre, while Tolstoy's War and Peace carries off the literary honours ... it's quickly apparent that the Russian-born author Paullina Simons has the measure of this kind of epic romantic saga. The power of her descriptive writing, the vividness of the historical detail and, most of all, the strength of her central characters mark out her novel as a considerable achievement ... she is able to make some powerful statements about the durability of the human spirit, but never at the expense of descriptive passages refulgent with power and beauty' Barry Forshaw, amazon",

        "B0000TSRA6": "The virus has spread online, and Resident Evil's gameplay has never been so infectious. Fighting for life with three human-controlled characters at your side definitely adds an element of unfamiliarity to the survival horror mix, but make no mistake, this is still Resident Evil. Whether you find yourself jumping out of your seat as a zombie crashes through a window, marveling at the action in the cutscenes, or complaining about the stiffness of control and awkwardly placed camera angles, this is just another trip to Raccoon City. Only this time, you're with friends.I really have to hand it to Capcom for making teamwork the cornerstone of gameplay. In every room that you reach, this game hammers home the message that you have to stick together and work as a group. When jumping from one rooftop to another, you may misjudge the distance and fall short. Thankfully, a teammate can pull you up.Even before the game commences, you'll find yourself coordinating tactics with your soon-to-be companions at the character selection screen. In a similar vein to an RPG, each of the eight playable characters that you can select brings completely different abilities to the table that you must factor in. Do you bring a lock-picker? Someone with extra inventory spots? Or rely on firepower with a weapons expert?Unlike the other games in the series, zombies can pass from room to room and are often found in packs. Taking this newfound hunting prowess into account, Capcom has implemented a handful of new techniques that players can use to survive. You can slide under beds, hide in lockers, and even repel a zombie attack by forcing their head away from your neck with enough breathing room to raise your pistol and shoot them directly between the eyes. You'll even find strategy in the reloading of weapons. For instance, a box of shells takes more time to load than a clip. As annoying as it is to watch your character get munched because he couldn't load the rounds quick enough, I really like this aspect. It makes you keep an eye on every little detail.Where Outbreak excels in engrossing multiplayer and creative gameplay, the overall design of the game is very odd. Rather than creating one lengthy quest that players can really sink their teeth into, Capcom opted to break up the game into five separate scenarios that are roughly 45 minutes each. If you die, you'll turn into a zombie for a brief extent (and yes, you can attack your teammates if you like), then will be dropped out of the game. Sadly, you can't re-spawn. You either have to wait for your friends to finish up, or find another game to enter. While scripted controller commands are offered, it doesn't support voice chat at all or keyboard functionality in-game. Someone's head should roll for this!All told, this is a surprisingly enjoyable online venture that showcases some amazing gameplay concepts, yet a lack of foresight in the delivery of multiplayer.Concept:A highly creative, yet slightly flawed approach to multiplayer survival horrorGraphics:Not as lavish as the recent GameCube releases, yet impressive nonethelessSound:Great ambiance, but it sure would be nice to communicate with other players. Where's the voice chat?!Playability:Familiar RE controls with innovative teammate techniques and newfound environment interactionEntertainment:Entertaining, yet lacking all the elements that would keep you hookedReplay:Moderately LowRated:7.5 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:May 20042nd Opinion:Why isn't there voice chat in Resident Evil: Outbreak? For the love of all that is holy, I want to give this game a good score for its thoughtful level design, nice graphics, intense gameplay, and smart mission structure&nbsp;&#8211; but that missing headset support throws the whole experience out of whack. These levels are fast-paced and frantic, almost like an FPS, and what you want is to make some sort of strategy. This just isn't possible with the canned commands available, as \"You two check out the locker room and we're going to search the owner's office. Meet back here and we'll go up to the 3rd floor,\" weirdly isn't mapped to the right analog stick. So, this game gets the backhanded compliment of being \"high concept\" like Crystal Chronicles and Steel Battalion, for example. My ideal setup is playing this game with four friends, four TVs, and four PS2s all in the same room. Get this setup, and the game is a real gem.Rated:8 out of 10Editor:Lisa MasonSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review",

Eighteen months later only one ship remained and 18 passengers survived. Marco Polo never revealed what happened to these lost ships. Embarking on a quest to find the lost fleet, fortune hunter Nathan Drake soon realizes Marco Polo was hiding a much bigger secret - he had gone on a secret expedition to find the mythical kingdom of Shambhala and to recover the legendary Cintamani Stone, the \"Wish-fulfilling jewel\" of Buddhist mythology.

This quest also pits him against a new, more formidable adversary - a ruthless, rogue paramilitary leader with a private army and a relentless ambition to recover the stone for himself.GameplayAlthough gameplay inAmong Thievesis similar to that of the previous game, there are several major differences.

This autobiographical bildungsroman brings out the creepiest aspects of childhood, conveying the terror and fascination that young Marilyn (then called Brian) felt when looking through his grandfather's pornography, getting his first French kiss, and being taunted by the girls he wanted to \"date.\" Manson has the benefit of having grown up as an outcast and loser and then having become a star without forgetting what he went through. This gives him an incredibly broad perspective, which he brings to bear on his ordinary life in order to convey the more potent and frightening moments that shaped him into the pale-skinned weirdo that the Christian Right loves to hate.  Best of all, Manson is shockingly honest, and portrays himself as occasionally stupid, self-centered, over-sensitive, ignoble, and, mostly, highly fallible and human.

        "0060541431": "Grade 8-10&ndash;This whirlwind adventure begins as Ginny, 17, reads a letter from her free-spirited, unpredictable Aunt Peg, who has recently passed away. She is given several destinations, four rules, and the instruction to open one envelope upon her arrival at each place. Thus begins a rapid tour of Europe as the teen struggles to accomplish the tasks established by her aunt. The motivation: Ginny wants to understand the woman's wanderlust and, possibly, she just wants a connection to her beloved relative. Throughout her adventures in Rome, Paris, Greece, England, and the Netherlands, the teen collects pieces of Peg's past and learns more about her rapid departure. She also learns much about herself. The reason Ginny is sent to meet certain people is not always clear; sometimes she (and readers) wonder about the point of the exercise. Overall, though, the novel drives home the importance of family, love, and the value of connections that you make with people. It is a quick read that will interest high school girls.&ndash;Emily Garrett, Naaman Forest High School, Garland, TXCopyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0062116851": "In this, the fourth book of the Rain Wilds Chronicles, the excitement and intensity continue as Tintaglia, the legendary dragon, has returned, but wounded by the Chalcedeans. These people are still seeking dragon body parts, but especially dragon blood, in an effort to save their despotic duke. To heal the dragon, the new Elderlings must find the elusive silver wells. The younger dragons have matured further, and their dedicated keepers, the new Elderlings, are beginning to gain deeper understanding of their roles. For a reader who has followed the story from the beginning, this episode both fulfills and leaves the reader wanting more. The characters continue to evolve, drawing the reader ever more fully into the world they inhabit. For readers unfamiliar with the ongoing story, this book may be somewhat confusing, because the story and characters are built on the prior tales. However, for those who have read others of Hobb&#x2019;s books set in the same world, dragons, magic, and intrigue combine to make this book a fascinating read. --Rebecca Gerber",
        "B000FQBPCQ": "When an evil darkness enshrouds the land of Hyrule, a young farm boy named Link must awaken the hero and the animal within. When Link travels to the Twilight Realm, he transforms into a wolf and must scour the land with the help of a mysterious girl named Midna. Besides his trusty sword and shield, Link will use his bow and arrows by aiming with the Wii Remote controller, fight while on horseback and use a wealth of other items, both new and old.The most epic Zelda ever launches with the Wii.Link roams an entirely new land of Hyrule.View larger.Take control of your trusty horse as you travel from quest to quest.View larger.Link must solve a number of challenging puzzles to progress to boss battles.View larger.Fishing with the Wii Remote is a fun and worthwhile diversion.View larger.Link's journeys, reinventedHailed by many as the best Zelda game since 1998'sOcarina of Time,Twilight Princessthrusts players into a troubled world ravaged by a dangerous magic. Sporting a new, more realistic visual style than the previous Zelda title, Link looks much more like an adult than in previous installments and fits well into an environment that provides Zelda fans with a much more gritty and grim environment to explore. The entirety of the quest fits this darker mood, as both Link and NPC's alike share the same concern for the changes about in Hyrule.More than just a spiritual successor to previous Zelda installments,Twilight Princessoffers players a new way of controlling Link through dungeons, forests, towns, and the bizarre Twilight Realm: precise weapon controls with the Wii remote! Players can use the remote to control Links' weapons including the sword, arrows, and boomerang. This new control scheme allows for much faster and more accurate control than on previous Nintendo hardware. For example, waving the remote in the air will result in Link performing the same move with the sword. To fire off on arrow, players \"pull back\" on a virtual controller string as the Wii remote's speaker lets players know that the projectile is ready for release. It all works incredibly well and adds to the title's immersion and style- you feel more in the center of the action than in previous Zelda games.As impressive as the new control scheme is, the scope and size of the new land of the Hyrule is equally as impressive- truly the Wii's first epic adventure. Beautifully crafted and four years in the making, the land players travel through is vast and diverse as the dungeons and monsters that lie within. As players collect triforce pieces from the distant sections of the continent, they will get to know many different villages and foes. Thankfully, Link will be able to move over long stretches of land faster thanks to \"Epona,\" your faithful horse. Epona also helps Link become a more effective fighter, as a number of powerful and impressive sword strikes can be launched while galloping through fields of enemies.The Twilight Realm awaitsLike most games in the Zelda franchise, Link begins his adventure with little more than the clothes he has on an an inkling that something has gone awry. After an initial trip to the Twilight Realm, in which Link appears as a wolf, a friendly shadow dweller named Midna will meet up with players and give helpful advice on gameplay. Fortunately for players, this virtual assistant spells out ways to be a more effective adventurer in and out of the shadow world. Early stages of the game have Link spending a lot of time in the Twilight Realm, and outdoor areas of Hyrule, attempting to clear areas of the strange darkness that has seemingly fallen over every village, forest, and field. As the story progresses, players will learn the cause of the shadows, and what they must to do vanquish them for good.Puzzling puzzlesLink once again finds himself in a number of classic Zelda-esque puzzle scenarios in which he must light torches to unlock doors, raise and lower water levels, and fight enemies to collect keys and open chests for valuable rupees. A number of the dungeons present unique puzzle challenges that rely on the player's ability to hone their Wii remote's control, such as an air castle in the sky that can only be accessed by an extremely accurate grappling hook toss.In general,Twilight Princessis more challenging than the average Zelda game, with a number of boss battles having protracted hit sequences with little support potions about, and even less warning. Still, there's never been an adventure experience such as this, wherein players can literally charge at a dungeon boss with their fists and punch the air to defeat an enormous foe. As the finest Zelda experience in almost ten years and the game fans have been waiting for,Twilight Princesswill delight young and old gamers alike.",

        "0061430234": "Cheney, a former L.A. entertainment lawyer, pointedly dispels expectations of a safe ride through this turbulent account of bipolar disorder. With evocative imagery&mdash;time-shuffled recollections meant to mirror her disorienting extremes of mood&mdash;Cheney conjures life at the mercy of a brain chemistry that yanks her from soul-starving despair to raucous exuberance, impetuous pursuits to paralyzing lethargy. Caught in a riptide of febrile impulse, she caroms from seductions to suicide attempts while flirting recklessly with men, danger and death, only to find more hazards in the drastic side effects of treatment. More than a train-wreck tearjerker, the memoir draws strength from salient observations that expose the frustrations of bipolar disorder, from its brutal sabotage of romance and friendship to the challenge it poses to the simplest emotions, such as the terrors of being happy that augur mania's onset. Though she sustains an ominous mood and relays horrifying incidents with icy candor, Cheney lightens up at times, as when she marvels at the ease of masking her condition at an office that brings out everyone's manic side. But the narrative hopscotch frustrates readers' need for grounding and context that might clear up Cheney's muddled history and satisfy readers' urge to learn the fallout of her impulse-driven episodes. Her startlingly lucid descriptions of illness merit a more concise chronology.(Feb.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

        "0060589469": "In his now classicZen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, Robert Pirsig brings us a literary chautauqua, a novel that is meant to both entertain and edify. It scores high on both counts.Phaedrus, our narrator, takes a present-tense cross-country motorcycle trip with his son during which the maintenance of the motorcycle becomes an illustration of how we can unify the cold, rational realm of technology with the warm, imaginative realm of artistry. As in Zen, the trick is to become one with the activity, to engage in it fully, to see and appreciate all details--be it hiking in the woods, penning an essay, or tightening the chain on a motorcycle.In his autobiographical first novel, Pirsig wrestles both with the ghost of his past and with the most important philosophical questions of the 20th century--why has technology alienated us from our world? what are the limits of rational analysis? if we can't define the good, how can we live it? Unfortunately, while exploring the defects of our philosophical heritage from Socrates and the Sophists to Hume and Kant, Pirsig inexplicably stops at the middle of the 19th century. With the exception of Poincar&eacute;, he ignores the more recent philosophers who have tackled his most urgent questions, thinkers such as Peirce, Nietzsche (to whom Phaedrus bears a passing resemblance), Heidegger, Whitehead, Dewey, Sartre, Wittgenstein, and Kuhn. In the end, the narrator's claims to originality turn out to be overstated, his reasoning questionable, and his understanding of the history of Western thought sketchy. His solution to a synthesis of the rational and creative by elevating Quality to a metaphysical level simply repeats the mistakes of the premodern philosophers. But in contrast to most other philosophers, Pirsig writes a compelling story. And he is a true innovator in his attempt to popularize a reconciliation of Eastern mindfulness and nonrationalism with Western subject/object dualism. The magic ofZen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenanceturns out to lie not in the answers it gives, but in the questions it raises and the way it raises them. Like a cross betweenThe Razor's EdgeandSophie's World,Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenancetakes us into \"the high country of the mind\" and opens our eyes to vistas of possibility.--Brian Bruya--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

At a loss, he takes up with a mysterious character called Wednesday, who is much more than he appears. In fact, Wednesday is an old god, once known as Odin the All-father, who is roaming America rounding up his forgotten fellows in preparation for an epic battle against the upstart deities of the Internet, credit cards, television, and all that is wired. Shadow agrees to help Wednesday, and they whirl through a psycho-spiritual storm that becomes all too real in its manifestations. For instance, Shadow's dead wife Laura keeps showing up, and not just as a ghost--the difficulty of their continuing relationship is by turns grim and darkly funny, just like the rest of the book.Armed only with some coin tricks and a sense of purpose, Shadow travels through, around, and underneath the visible surface of things, digging up all the powerful myths Americans brought with them in their journeys to this land as well as the ones that were already here. Shadow's road story is the heart of the novel, and it's here that Gaiman offers up the details that make this such a cinematic book--the distinctly American foods and diversions, the bizarre roadside attractions, the decrepit gods reduced to shell games and prostitution. \"This is a bad land for Gods,\" says Shadow.More than a tourist in America, but not a native, Neil Gaiman offers an outside-in and inside-out perspective on the soul and spirituality of the country--our obsessions with money and power, our jumbled religious heritage and its societal outcomes, and the millennial decisions we face about what's real and what's not.--Therese Littleton--This text refers to theHardcoveredition.",

It doesn't take long for her to fall head over heels, or for Mel's mom to write, \"Get a ring on your finger before you uncross those legs, sweetie.\" When a mysterious e-mail arrives explaining that there is more to her beau than meets the eye, she is duly upset and uses the power of her pen to get even. But when Mrs. Friedlander's attacker returns, will Mel and Max be able to put their differences aside to catch a killer? Full of clever e-mail banter and tongue-in-cheek humor, this cheeky novel should be enjoyed in one sitting.Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.",

After all, when Ellen Grier and  her family return to the rural hamlet of Holly's Field, Wisconsin, it's not exactly a happy homecoming. Her husband, James, has been laid off from  his job in Illinois. And for the moment, the family has moved in with  Ellen's in-laws, Fritz and Mary-Margaret, an unhappy pair who dislike their daughter-in-law almost as much as they despise each other:The first time Ellen sat at this table she was twenty years old, bright-cheeked after a spring afternoon spent walking along the  lakefront with James, planning their upcoming wedding. It was 1959 and she was  eager to make a good impression. She didn't know then that Mary-Margaret  disliked her, that she was consideredJimmy's mistake.Thirteen years later, in 1972, Ellen is back at the table with no  escape in sight. Both she and her husband do find work. Yet James seems to  settle a tad too easily into his old life, and shows no interest in finding a place of their own. Even worse, his job takes him away from home for  weeks at a time, leaving Ellen to cope with her abusive in-laws.InVinegar HillAnsay paints a searing portrait of the Midwest's dark side, of a rural culture infected with despair and ruled over by  an unforgiving God. Yet she does hold out a grain of hope, too. Just as  Ellen seems permanently entangled in familial desperation, she makes a  surprising discovery about James's long-dead grandmother--a woman whose rebellious spirit inspires Ellen to rescue herself and her loved ones from the impinging darkness. This late-breaking redemption doesn't cancel out  the preceding unhappiness:Vinegar Hillremains a tough,  uncompromising tale, one that requires some fortitude to read.

        "006193836X": "Originally serialized in the New York Times Magazine, Lippman's Tess Monaghan novella turns the intrepid Baltimore PI's at-risk late-pregnancy bed rest into a compellingly edgy riff on Hitchcock's Rear Window. Lovingly tucked up on her winterized sun porch, Tess marshals her forces--doting artist boyfriend Crow, best friend Whitney Talbot, middle-aged assistant gumshoe Mrs. Blossom, and researcher Dorie Starnes--to probe the disappearance of a chic blonde green-raincoated dog walker she'd been watching from her comfy prison. Tess also takes in the missing woman's abandoned green-slickered Italian greyhound from hell, a miniature canine terrorist whose anti-housebreaking vendetta offers comic relief from Tess's threatened pre-eclampsia, her obsessive unraveling of a complex scam, and her last-trimester spats with Crow about their future. Though postpartum Tess turns alternately weepy and shrill, that condition won't last, and this entertaining romp leaves plenty of hints of detective-mother exploits to come.

Earl and naval hero Gabriel Fairchild lost his sight, fallen-angel good looks and fianc&eacute;e after the battle of Trafalgar, only to acquire tart-tongued nurse Samantha Wickersham, a young woman with a shadowy past who refuses to let Gabriel sink into self-pity. As she teaches him how to navigate his mansion and regain his independence, he guides her along a journey of shared desire. But while Samantha gives Gabriel her heart, she keeps her secrets, vanishing when it becomes clear that Gabriel can finally survive without her assistance. Here the story staggers, revealing vital information hardly hinted at before. Then Samantha, who's cast as a straight shooter in the first half, inexplicably begins acting out of character, sending the final portion of the book into a spin that grows worse with every page.

        "0062008110": "The main drama in Bronte's novel happens in a long narrative told by an elderly housekeeper to a convalescing new tenant. This story-within-a-story setup makes it well suited for audio adaptation, as Scales takes the housekeeper's part and relates the past, while West performs as the tenant and describes the present. Scales primarily uses a folksy lower-class accent, but she also makes her voice harsh and threatening when speaking as Heathcliff, the surly man at the novel's heart. West, as the bewildered tenant, manages to sound both nervous and pretentious, but his part is fairly small, especially with this abridgment, so he mostly serves to provide transitions for the housekeeper's story. The extensive abridgment generally deletes sentences and phrases rather than entire paragraphs or sections. One drawback for the audio format is the difficulty of clarifying the novel's convoluted plot and family tree, since it's harder to search back through long CD tracks than through earlier chapters of the paperback. While a little of the depth of Bronte's writing is lost in abridgment, the novel's emotional core remains intact and wrenching, and the actors' heartfelt interpretations make it easy to imagine being curled up by a warm fire listening to an absorbing tale.

By the time she reaches Oklahoma, this strong-willed young Kentucky native with a quick tongue and an open mind is catapulted into a surprising new life. Taylor leaves home in a beat-up '55 Volkswagen bug, on her way to nowhere in particular, savoring her freedom. But when a forlorn Cherokee woman drops a baby in Taylor's passenger seat and asks her to take it, she does. A first novel, The Bean Trees is an overwhelming delight, as random and unexpected as real life. The unmistakable voice of its irresistible heroine is whimsical, yet deeply insightful. Taylor playfully names her little foundling \"Turtle,\" because she clings with an unrelenting, reptilian grip; at the same time, Taylor aches at the thought of the silent, staring child's past suffering. With Turtle in tow, Taylor lands in Tucson, Ariz., with two flat tires and decides to stay. The desert climate, landscape and vegetation are completely foreign to Taylor, and in learning to love Arizona, she also comes face to face with its rattlesnakes and tarantulas. Similarly, Taylor finds that motherhood, responsibility and independence are thorny, if welcome, gifts.

        "0062120999": "Jim Collins on the Writing ProcessWhen I first embarked on a career that required writing, I devoured dozens of books about the process of writing.  I soon realized that each writer has weird tricks and idiosyncratic methods.  Some wrote late at night, in the tranquil bubble of solitude created by a sleeping world, while others preferred first morning light.  Some cranked out three pages a day, workmanlike, whereas others worked in extended bursts followed by catatonic exhaustion.  Some preferred the monastic discipline of facing cinder-block walls, while others preferred soaring views.I quickly learned that I had to discover my own methods.  Most useful, I realized that I have different brains at different times of day.  In the morning, I have a creative brain; in the evening, I have a critical brain.  If I try to edit in the morning, I&rsquo;m too creative, and if I try to create in the evening, I&rsquo;m too critical.  So, I go at writing like a two piston machine: create in the morning, edit in the evening, create in the morning, edit in the evening&hellip;Yet all writers seem to agree on one point: writing well is desperately difficult, and it never gets easier.  It&rsquo;s like running: if you push your limits, you can become a faster runner, but you will always suffer.  In nonfiction, writing is thinking; if I can&rsquo;t make the words work, that means I don&rsquo;t know yet what I think.  Sometimes after toiling in a quagmire for dozens (or hundreds) of hours I throw the whole effort into the wastebasket and start with a blank page.  When I sheepishly shared this wastebasket strategy with the great management writer Peter Drucker, he made me feel much better when he exclaimed, &ldquo;Ah, that is immense progress!&rdquo;The final months of completingGreat by Choicerequired seven days a week effort, with numerous all-nighters.  I had naively hoped after writingGood to Greatthat perhaps I had learned enough about writing that this work might not require descending deep into the dark cave of despair.  Alas, the cave of darkness is the only path to producing the best work; there is no easy path, no shorter path, no path of less suffering.  Winston Churchill once said that writing a book goes through five phases.  In phase one, it is a novelty or a toy; by phase five, it is a tyrant ruling your life, and just as you are about to be reconciled to your servitude, you kill the monster and fling him to the public.  And so, exiting the caving blinking in the sunlight, we&rsquo;ve killed the monster and hereby fling.  We love this book, and have great passion about sharing it with the world&mdash;making all the suffering worthwhile.A Q&amp;A with Morten T. HansenQ:How did you and Jim develop ideas together during the research?Hansen:During our hundreds of research meetings&mdash;what we called &ldquo;chimposiums&rdquo; (as when two curious chimps get together), Jim and I probed the data, exchanged views, and debated vigorously. We didn't always agree, in which case we did some more analysis to get to the main findings we report in Great by Choice.Q:Why didGreat by Choicetake nine years of effort?Hansen:When Jim and I started out some nine years ago, we did not anticipate that it would take us this long, nor did we know what the results would be.  We followed a simple principle&mdash;carry out the absolutely best research we could possibly do, no matter how long.Q:Did you find what you expected, or surprises?Hansen:The way we did the research was to explore why some companies attained great performance over the long-run while others did not. We did not start with any preconceived ideas and hypotheses about what made the difference. We let the data speak. What we found, and what we report in the book, surprised us a great deal. A few times we scratched our heads because we were so surprised, but that's what the data revealed.Q:Did you have fun?Hansen:Analyzing the data, debating, and arriving at some really interesting insights was a great deal of fun. It created joy in my life. It may not be everyone's idea of having a good time, but Jim and I always looked forward to our chimposiums.  I hope you will enjoyGreat by Choiceas much as Jim and I enjoyed the research process!",
        "0061551821": "Wright, one of the greatest, and certainly most prolific, Bible scholars in the world, will touch a nerve with this book. What happens when we die? How should we think about heaven, hell, purgatory and eternal life? Wright critiques the views of heaven that have become regnant in Western culture, especially the assumption of the continuance of the soul after death in a sort of blissful non-bodily existence. This is simply not Christian teaching, Wright insists. The New Testament's clear witness is to the resurrection of the body, not the migration of the soul. And not right away, but only when Jesus returns in judgment and glory. The \"paradise,\" the experience of being \"with Christ\" spoken of occasionally in the scriptures, is a period of waiting for this return. But Christian teaching of life after death should really be an emphasis on \"life after life after death\"-the resurrection of the body, which is also the ground for all faithful political action, as the last part of this book argues. Wright's prose is as accessible as it is learned-an increasingly rare combination. No one can doubt his erudition or the greatness of the churchmanship of the Anglican Bishop of Durham. One wonders, however, at the regular citation of his own previous work. And no other scholar can get away so cleanly with continuing to propagate the \"hellenization thesis,\" by which the early church is eventually polluted by contaminating Greek philosophical influence.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0061374199": "Cheese Olamon, \"a six-foot-two, four-hundred-and-thirty-pound  yellow-haired Scandinavian who'd somehow arrived at the misconception he was black,\" is telling his old grammar school friends Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro why they have to convince another mutual chum, the gun dealer Bubba Rugowski, that Cheese didn't try to have him killed. \"You let Bubba know I'm clean when it comes to what happened to him. You want me alive. Okay? Without me, that girl will be gone. Gone-gone. You understand? Gone, baby, gone.\" Of all the chilling, completely credible scenes of sadness, destruction, and betrayal in Dennis Lehane's fourth and very possibly best book about Kenzie and Gennaro, this moment stands out because it captures in a few pages the essence of Lehane's success.Private detectives Kenzie and Gennaro, who live in the same working-class Dorchester neighborhood of Boston where they grew up, have gone to visit drug dealer Cheese in prison because they think he's involved in the kidnapping of 4-year-old Amanda McCready. Without sentimentalizing the grotesque figure of Cheese, Lehane tells us enough about his past to make us understand why he and the two detectives might share enough trust to possibly save a child's life when all the best efforts of traditional law enforcement have failed. By putting Kenzie and Gennaro just to one side of the law (but not totally outside; they have several cop friends, a very important part of the story), Lehane adds depth and edge to traditional genre relationships. The lifelong love affair between Kenzie and Gennaro--interrupted by her marriage to his best friend--is another perfectly controlled element that grows and changes as we watch. Surrounded by dead, abused, and missing children, Kenzie mourns and rages while Gennaro longs for one of her own. So the choices made by both of them in the final pages of this absolutely gripping story have the inevitability of life and the dazzling beauty of art.Other Kenzie/Gennaro books available in paperback:Darkness, Take My Hand,A Drink Before the War,Sacred.--Dick Adler--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",
        "B0000DJX7I": "Praised for brilliant scripts and open-ended gameplay, vilified for unapologetic violence and mature themes,Grand Theft Autohas deservedly become one of the most popular game franchises in history. This double pack contains the full versions of bothGrand Theft Auto IIIandGrand Theft Auto III: Vice City, enhanced for Xbox. Xbox gamers can rejoice that the grand king of video games--The Sopranoswith a gamepad--is finally available on the big black box.Grand Theft AutoWithGrand Theft Auto IIIRockstar proves that not all developers are concerned with toning down the violence in their games. This sequel is even more bloody, violent, and sadistic than its popular predecessors, offering up an enormous 3-D city in which nearly any criminal act is possible. Players are free to steal cars, beat up the local population for their money (or weapons), make time with prostitutes, or simply roam to their heart's content. Those seeking more structure can embark on dozens of missions driven by a genuinely interesting crime-story plot or steal cars that let them play minigames. Nab a cop car and you can go on vigilante missions. Grab a cab and you can play a deadly version ofCrazy Taxi. Take a fire truck and you can earn money putting out fires. The minigames are a good way to unwind after a particularly difficult mission. With so much to do, the game just never gets boring.As you'd expect, there are consequences for criminality. As your random acts of mayhem mount up the police start hounding you, eventually calling in SWAT trucks, the FBI, and even the army if you continue down the path of destruction. Shaking these pursuers is easily the most fun part of the game, especially when a bunch of friends are packed in the room to witness your narrow escapes.Grand Theft Auto IIIis fine-tuned to near perfection in every category. All the vehicles, from slick sports cars to lumbering dump trucks, handle exactly as you'd expect and smash apart realistically when abused. The three islands in the game are rendered in terrific detail considering their size, and are packed with traffic, pedestrians, and hidden jumps. The audio is equally amazing. Pedestrians talk, cops scream at you, and you can tune in nine different radio stations whenever you are in a car. It all adds up to a monumental achievement: the rare console game for adults that manages to get everything right.--T. Byrl BakerGrand Theft Auto III: Vice CityHow big is this game? Even publicists for other games end up talking aboutVice Citywhen they call our office, babbling in the same helplessly intoxicated way that afflicts everyone who plays it. The achievement ofVice City(which, as everyone knows by now, is set in the 1980s and offers an all-new, Miami Vice-inspired story) is not only that it manages to live up to an absurd level of expectation, but that it takes the game places that fans of its predecessorGrand Theft Auto IIInever dreamed of, and that it achieves this astonishing level of innovation without losing anything that madeGTA3the bestselling PS2 game of all time.After a brilliant homage to the era of the Commodore 64 in the opening credits, the first thing you'll notice is the improved graphics, which are smoother and more detailed, and--with effects like neon lights reflected on rain-slick streets, and intense Florida sunlight--have a lush, tropical look that immediately gives you a strong sense of place. The architecture is more fabulous by tenfold, with art deco buildings, high-rise hotels, and believably seedy back alleys. The control scheme is essentially the same as inGTA3, but the cars handle much better, and in pedestrian mode there is a new crouch move. You will have access to fast, great-handling cars right away, as opposed toGTA3which made you unlock the second island before you could get your hands on any respectable wheels. This game has such riches to offer that there is no need to be chintzy with the vehicles.Cops are more vigilant this time--minor offenses like whacking innocent bystanders will more often than not get you a two-star wanted level--and are harder to elude (though they still can't seem to climb stairs or negotiate sharp turns). So while free-roaming exploration is as fun as ever, there is more incentive to perform the missions instead of randomly raising hell. Not that that's a bad thing: even lazy criminals like myself (inGTA3, I would rather toss hand grenades into traffic than follow orders from some rude Mafia boss) will be quickly caught up in the vivid characters and hilarious, fascinating story, in which you play an acid-washed-jeans-wearing thug named Tommy Vercetti. Where inGTA3missions were blocky, schematic affairs only nominally connected to the story, this time tasks move the story briskly along and deftly blend cinematics and game action. For example, there is a scene of a character throwing Tommy a gun, at which point you are suddenly thrown back into the action and must make an instant decision about whom to trust and what to do.There are more, and more detailed, indoor environments, including a hotel, police station, and mall (a slight downside to this is that some of the more elaborate indoor environments require load times). The layout of the city, with tons of backyards, narrow alleys, and fire escapes, encourages creativity when eluding pursuit, as does greater access to rooftops. Get your motorcycle up the fire escape and a whole new world of action is possible, including... well, use your imagination.This overview barely scratches the surface of theVice Cityexperience, its colorful explosion of music, clothes, combat, and brilliant voice acting, not to mention the plot twist midway through the game that changes the very nature of the game itself. Though it was the outrageous, amoral violence that got all the press, the essential genius ofGTA3was its intoxicating blend of script and open-ended action. InVice Citythis is--to use a clich&#xE9; that is for once apropos--taken to a whole new level.--David StoeszPros:Open-ended gameplay; player can chose to be relatively law-abiding or engage in wanton virtual destructionVaried missionsBrilliant scripts with Hollywood voice actingRocking sound track (also available in our Music store)Xbox-enhanced graphicsCons:As theThe Sopranosof games,GTA 3draws unwanted attention from overzealous legislatorsNo multiplayer",

        "0061978086": "Gr 4-6-Patrick has always been a sweet, lovable child, but one morning Liza notices that her younger brother seems remote and somehow empty. Their parents are too preoccupied to notice, but Liza remembers eerie stories her beloved babysitter used to tell. She realizes that this not-Patrick is a changeling. Her real brother has been taken by the spindlers-spiderlike creatures that haunt the world below. These evil beings gather their power from the souls of those they steal, while the counterfeits they leave behind spawn more spindlers to prey on the human sphere. When Liza resolves to brave the danger and retrieve Patrick's soul, she meets Mirabella, a talking rat who claims to know the way to the spindler queen's nesting place. Together, they set off on their quest. The underground realm is filled with unusual residents-some amusing, some quietly beautiful, and some truly terrifying. Mirabella seems friendly and helpful, but the rat's cheerful demeanor hides a shocking secret. Ultimately, Liza and Mirabella must face their own tests of courage and sacrifice with not only Patrick's fate, but all of Below at stake. This imaginative fantasy emphasizes individual initiative and the power of hope and friendship. Below is a fully realized alternate world with echoes of both classic literature and mythology. This is particularly notable in its variety of inhabitants. Although the creatures are Oliver's own creations, such beings as the winged, dream-bearing nocturni and the shape-shifting, cannibalistic scawgs have the feel of true folklore. With strong, self-reliant female characters and well-defined action, this is a strong addition to fantasy collections.-Elaine E. Knight, Lincoln Elementary Schools, IL&#x3B1;(c) Copyright 2011.

As Laskin (Partisans) writes in this gripping chronicle of meteorological chance and human folly and error, the School Children's Blizzard, as it came to be known, was \"a clean, fine blade through the history of the prairie,\" a turning point in the minds of the most steadfast settlers: by the turn of the 20th century, 60% of pioneer families had left the plains. Laskin shows how portions of Minnesota, Nebraska and the Dakotas, heavily promoted by railroads and speculators, represented \"land, freedom, hope\" for thousands of impoverished European immigrants&mdash;particularly Germans and Scandinavians&mdash;who instead found an unpredictable, sometimes brutal environment, a \"land they loved but didn't really understand.\" Their stories of bitter struggle in the blizzard, which Laskin relates via survivors' accounts and a novelistic imagination, are consistently affecting. And Laskin's careful consideration of the inefficiencies of the army's inexpert weather service and his chronicle of the storm's aftermath in the papers (differences in death counts provoked a national \"unseemly brawl\") add to this rewarding read.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

What she finds is far from pretty, revealing parallels to her own awful past. There are others, none without tragedy. But their morbid, often unrepentantly violent stories are balanced with moments of emotional escape--poetic beauty from outside the prison and strange explanations from within. These magical aspects, or \"enchanted things,\" are the sensational imaginings of an unhinged, unnamed inmate--York's prison neighbor and our narrator. His is a unique perspective--one that is at once irrational and insightful, driving the plot and providing context and description beyond the walls of the prison and beyond the realms of reality. The result is captivating and perplexing. Given such dark subjects, \"enjoying\"The Enchantedmay feel uncomfortable, but there&#x2019;s no crime in embracing Denfeld's ability to evoke empathy for seemingly undeserving characters and inspire wonder within an unlikely place. --Robin A.

Their tyranny is opposed by retired god Sam, who mocks the Celestial City, introduces Buddhism to subvert Hindu dogma, allies himself with the planet's native \"demons\" against Heaven, fights pyrotechnic battles with bizarre troops and weapons, plays dirty with politics and poison, and dies horribly but won't stay dead. It's a huge, lumbering, magical story, told largely in flashback, full of wonderfully ornate language (and one unforgivable pun) that builds up the luminous myth of trickster Sam, Lord of Light.

One manuscript, The Crosswicks Horror, was left unfinished, and Oates has now resurrected it as a lush, arch, and blistering fusion of historical fact, supernatural mystery, and devilish social commentary. High-strung and ambitious Woodrow Wilson is the president of Princeton. Anxious over festering conflicts and appalled by what he learns about his distant relative and prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; after the nearby lynching of an African American man and his pregnant sister, Wilson seeks advice from retired Reverend Winslow Slade, who would rather think about the upcoming wedding of his granddaughter, Annabel. But this fair maiden is in danger of falling under the spell of a handsome stranger with otherworldly eyes. As an elite WASP enclave finds itself caught in the grip of inexplicable terror, readers will be bewitched by a fantastically dramatic, supremely imaginative plot rife with ghosts, vampires, demons, and human folly. Oates brings her nightshade humor and extraordinary fluency in eroticism and violence, American history and literature (her magnetizing characters include Mark Twain, Jack London, and Upton Sinclair) to this piercing novel of the devastating toll of repression and prejudice, sexism and class warfare. A diabolically enthralling and subversive literary mash-up.

For his cousin, Roman, it is the vision that together they can find fortune in Liberty City, gateway to the land of opportunity. As they slip into debt and are dragged into a criminal underworld by a series of shysters, thieves and sociopaths, they discover that the reality is very different from the dream in a city that worships money and status, and is heaven for those who have them and a living nightmare for those who don&#146;t.Beginning with the 1997 release of the originalGrand Theft Auto, theGTAseries has been one of the most prolific, controversial and down right entertaining franchises in video games history. This pedigree of success guarantees that the highly anticipated eleventh game in the series,Grand Theft Auto IV, will garner at least as much attention if not more.Return to Liberty City.The dream as Niko expected it.View larger.There's always a catch.View larger.But some skills are international.View larger.The PlotGrand Theft Auto IVis a brand new adventure in theGTAuniverse following the experiences of Nikolai \"Niko\" Bellic, a new immigrant from an undisclosed eastern European country whose troubled pa  st and the persuasion of his cousin Roman have brought him to the fictional Liberty City. Unfortunately, Niko&#146;s search for the American Dream and a much needed fresh start, hits an immediate snag when the rags to riches story Roman spun to pique Niko's interest is exposed as not only a complete fabrication, but a ploy to enlist Niko&#146;s well-known skills as a tough guy against the ample list of enemies clamoring for Roman&#146;s debt-ridden blood.Because Roman is the only person Niko knows in Liberty City he begrudgingly accepts his role as Roman&#146;s protector despite the deception. But as time goes on Niko comes into his own, and his experience on the wrong side of the tracks proves more valuable than he could have ever imagined as he fights for survival and later supremacy on the crime ridden streets of Liberty City.Game EnvironmentsBased on several of the boroughs of New York City and parts of New Jersey, Liberty City, familiar to players of previous games in  the series, has been entirely redesigned forGTA IV. Players can expect visible detail down to the weeds growing in the cracks in the sidewalk, cars and buildings of visibly different ages and a much greater level if verticality in the buildings and bridges that they are able to explore as Niko moves through the city streets. In addition, pedestrians inGTA IVare much more realistic. No longer simply moving cardboard cutouts, these NPCs are intelligent, modern, human representations that laugh, cry, eat, drink, use cell phones and ATMs, and talking amongst themselves regardless of Niko&#146;s interaction with them.GameplayHistoricallyGTAgames have focused heavily on mission-based play, requiring successful completion of fixed tasks in order for players to progress through the game, but this has changed to a great extent inGTA IV. Players will experience an entirely new and exciting emphasis centered on the blending of on-mission and off-mission play, resulting not only in an increased sense of realism, but more interesting and unrestricted gameplay.FeaturesAside from the car jacking and a detailed city environment here are the new features forGTA IV:Improved combat system - Now you can use cover and also a target lock system, which allows you to take out targets with greater ease and accuracy. Plus, you can engage in some hand-to-hand combat if you can't get your hands on a piece quick enough.Cell phone - Not just for basic phone calls anymore.  Use your in-game cell phone to receive missions via SMS, snap photos, and ZiT (tag) songs that can be downloaded exclusively on Amazon.com/mp3.Free time - In between missions you can take advantage of \"me\" time.  There are gentleman's clubs, comedy clubs, bowling alleys, and bars, which all house unique activities.Take a break from the storyline - A variety of side missions allow you to help run a car service, \"borrow\" cop cars, assassinate targets, help solve problems for those on the street, or take to the air with stunt jumps that are scattered all over the city.Control your own fate - Throughout the game choice moments will arrive causing you to make a decision that will affect relationships and money.MultiplayerGive Niko a rest and create your own multiplayer \"hero.\"GTAhas added multiplayer modes allowing you to take your creation out to play online in competitive, co-op, and free form modes. Competitive mode has you fighting against the cops, jacking cars, or racing to finish odd jobs.  Co-op challenges you and your friends with various tasks including Hangman's NOOSE where you are responsible for escorting a wanted kingpin to a safe extraction point.  Freeform lets you and 15 others lose on Liberty City.  Use this mode to hit up the bar and play virtual darts versus each other or head out to the streets and set up your own drag races.

Establishing a garrison and naval base at Penobscot Bay, in the eastern province of Massachusetts that would become Maine, the Scots&#x2014;the only British troops between Canada and New York&#x2014;harry rebel privateers and give shelter to American loyalists.In response, Massachusetts sends a fleet of more than forty vessels and some one thousand infantrymen to &#x201C;captivate, kill or destroy&#x201D; the foreign invaders. Second in command is Peleg Wadsworth, a veteran of the battles at Lexington and Long Island, once aide to General Washington, and a man who sees clearly what must be done to expel the invaders.But ineptitude and irresolution lead to a mortifying defeat&#x2014;and have stunning repercussions for two men on opposite sides: an untested eighteen-year-old Scottish lieutenant named John Moore, who will begin an illustrious military career; and a Boston silversmith and patriot named Paul Revere, who will face court-martial for disobedience and cowardice.Grounded firmly in history, inimitably told in Cornwell's thrilling narrative style,The Fortis the extraordinary novel of this fascinating clash between a superpower and a nation in the making.A Q&amp;A with Author Bernard CornwellQ:While you&#x2019;ve written numerous historical novels, including a series set during the American Civil War, this is only your second book set during the American Revolution. What spurred your interest in this period at this time? Will you return to this period again?Cornwell:The original spark was reading a life of Lieutenant-General Sir John Moore, who was the man who, more than any other, forged the magnificent army that defeated Napoleon.  If he had not died beating Marshal Soult at Corunna in 1809 then Moore might well have been the hero of Waterloo instead of Wellington, but what intrigued me was to discover that, as a very young man, he had experienced his first taste of battle at Penobscot Bay in 1779. I had never heard of the Penobscot Expedition, so I read more, and discovered this amazing story!  The Penobscot Expedition was an attempt by the militia and navy of Massachusetts to evict a small British garrison from Fort George in what is now Castine, in Maine. Massachusetts assembled the largest rebel fleet of the revolution . . . and lost it all. It's a story of incompetence and lost opportunities, which leads to the worst naval disaster in American history prior to Pearl Harbor. Will I ever write about the revolution again?  I don't know...Q:Of all the battles waged during the Revolution why did you choose to write about the Penobscot expedition? What lessons does this battle offer us today?Cornwell:Choosing the Penobscot Expedition does seem perverse . . . after all, the fighting at Castine has been called 'the forgotten battle', and many people would probably prefer to leave it that way.  But there was the lure of the very young John Moore whose later career would be so eminent, and there was another man in Penobscot Bay who, if anything, would become even more famous. That was Lieutenant-Colonel Paul Revere, the commander of the Massachusetts Artillery Regiment.  I knew very little about Revere when I began to read about the expedition. I knew the famous poem, of course, but beyond that he was simply a shining hero of the revolution, so I was astonished to discover that the only time Revere ever fought the British was at Penobscot, and his record there was shameful.  This was simply too intriguing to ignore, and as the relationship of myth to reality has always fascinated me, I set out to tell the story. Does it have lessons for today? I don't write to teach such lessons . . . maybe you can conclude that war is best left to professionals who know what they're doing.Q:Given the obstacles the Americans faced&#x2014;the colonists were not unified in the desire to break with the crown, the lack of a dedicated, well-trained, and disciplined standing military, perpetual lack of funding, among others&#x2014;are you surprised that we actually succeeded in winning independence?Cornwell:And again there's a gap between myth and reality. It suits America to draw a picture of amateur patriots defeating the well drilled redcoats, but that picture is nonsense. As a result of the Seven Years War there was a firm tradition of militia training in the Thirteen Colonies, and most of the revolution's leaders had served in that war.  Then, early on, the rebels took steps to make a well-drilled and well-trained army. And, of course, they had France and Spain as allies. The largest army at Yorktown was the French army, the smallest was the British.  So no, I'm not surprised. The British government played into the rebel's hands with their stupidity, and the rebels had the inestimable advantage of being able to surrender vast amounts of territory and survive, while the British never had the forces to control that large territory. In 1779, when the novel is set, New England is virtually independent already--there are no British forces in Massachusetts which has its own judiciary, legislature, and administration.Q:While you have written several stand-alone thrillers, most of your fiction centers on war. What draws you to write military fiction? What is the most fascinating aspect of battle for you?Cornwell:Warfare offer something unique; a loosening of the moral laws that govern our lives.  Men and women are released to do things we abhor in peaceful times, and what interests me is how they react. Some react very badly, others attempt to hold onto their humanity through the horror. InThe Fortthere are no monsters, no horrors, but men struggling to understand what is happening to them.  The hero, Peleg Wadsworth, second in command of the American army, emerges as a real hero! A man of moral substance and great strength.  That intrigues me, that he can survive the loosening of moral bonds and emerge more resolute.",

        "0060529709": "The simplest thing would be to describeEverything Is Illuminated, Jonathan Safran Foer's accomplished debut, as a novel about the Holocaust. It is, but that really fails to do justice to the sheer ambition of this book. The main story is a grimly familiar one. A young Jewish American--who just happens to be called Jonathan Safran Foer--travels to the Ukraine in the hope of finding the woman who saved his grandfather from the Nazis. He is aided in his search by Alex Perchov, a na&#xEF;ve Ukrainian translator, Alex's grandfather (also called Alex), and a flatulent mongrel dog named Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. On their journey through Eastern Europe's obliterated landscape they unearth facts about the Nazi atrocities and the extent of Ukrainian complicity that have implications for Perchov as well as Safran Foer. This narrative is not, however, recounted from (the character) Jonathan Safran Foer's perspective. It is relayed through a series of letters that Alex sends to Foer. These are written in the kind of broken Russo-English normally reserved for Bond villains or Latka fromTaxi. Interspersed between these letters are fragments of a novel by Safran Foer--a wonderfully imagined, almost magical realist, account of life in the shtetl before the Nazis destroyed it. These are in turn commented on by Alex,  creating an additional metafictional angle to the tale.If all this sounds a little daunting, don't be put off; Safran Foer is an extremely funny as well as intelligent writer who combines some of the best Jewish folk yarns since Isaac Bashevis Singer with a quite heartbreaking meditation on love, friendship, and loss.--Travis Elborough, Amazon.co.uk--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

She \"rodated\" desperately, searching for someone to repair her wounded ego. She even found a reasonably suitable boyfriend-only she broke it off when he suggested living together. At one point she faced the truth she'd avoided from the beginning, that she had to learn to appreciate herself for her own accomplishments before she could have a healthy relationship with a man. While there's nothing new about that story line-indeed, it's curiously proto-feminist for a recent Barnard grad-Klein's sense of humor is downright wicked. Her ex-mother-in-law was a \"shrub of a woman\" who \"sounded like she'd swallowed a southerner\" and looked \"like a transvestite who had a one-night stand with a disco ball.\" Then there's \"Mr. Madras Pants,\" who \"carried a degree in poplin with a minor in seersucker... the type of man who was at complete ease when sending his order back to the kitchen.\" In the end, Klein's is a great, fun read.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0060887184": "Bestseller Cornwell leaps back a millennium from his Richard Sharpe series to tell of the consolidation of England in the late ninth century and the role played by a young (fictional) warrior-in-training who's at the center of the war between Christian Englishmen and the pagan Danes. (Most of the other principal characters&mdash;Ubba, Guthrum, Ivar the Boneless and the like&mdash;are real historical figures.) Young Uhtred, who's English, falls under the control of Viking &uuml;ber-warrior Ragnar the Fearless when the Dane wipes out Uhtred's Northumberland family. Cornwell liberally feeds readers history and nuggets of battle data and customs, with Uhtred's first-person wonderment spinning all into a colorful journey of (self-)discovery. In a series of episodes, Ragnar conquers three of England's four kingdoms. The juiciest segment has King Edmund of East Anglia rebuking the Viking pagans and demanding that they convert to Christianity if they intend to remain in England. After Edmund cites the example of St. Sebastian, the Danes oblige him by turning him into a latter-day Sebastian and sending him off to heaven. Uhtred's affection for Ragnar as a surrogate father grows, and he surpasses the conqueror's blood sons in valor. When father and adopted son arrive at the fourth and last kingdom, however, the Danes meet unexpected resistance and Uhtred faces personal and familial challenges, as well as a crisis of national allegiance.

In Maguire's Oz, Elphaba, better known as the Wicked Witch of the West, is not wicked; nor is she a formally schooled witch. Instead, she's an insecure, unfortunately green Munchkinlander who's willing to take radical steps to unseat the tyrannical Wizard of Oz. Using an appropriately brusque voice for the always blunt Elphaba, McDonough relates her tumultuous childhood (spent with an alcoholic mother and a minister father) and eye-opening school years (when she befriends her roommate, Glinda). McDonough's pacing remains frustratingly slow even after the plot picks up, and Elphaba's protracted ruminations on the nature of evil will have some listeners longing for an abridgement.

        "0060510862": "In the 1970s Joe Haldeman approached more than a dozen different publishers before he finally found one interested inThe Forever War.  The book went on to win both the Hugo and Nebula Awards, although a large chunk of the story had been cut out before it saw publication.  Now Haldeman and Avon Books have released the definitive version ofThe Forever War, published for the first time as Haldeman originally intended.  The book tells the timeless story of war, in this case a conflict between humanity and the alien Taurans.  Humans first bumped heads with the Taurans when we began using collapsars to travel the stars. Although the collapsars provide nearly instantaneous travel across vast distances, the relativistic speeds associated with the process means that time passes slower for those aboard ship.  For William Mandella, a physics student drafted as a soldier, that means more than 27 years will have passed between his first encounter with the Taurans and his homecoming, though he himself will have aged only a year. When Mandella finds that he can't adjust to Earth after being gone so long from home, he reenlists, only to find himself shuttled endlessly from battle to battle as the centuries pass.--Craig E.

        "0061998885": "Prayers for Rainis Dennis Lehane's fifth installment in his intricately plotted, beautifully written, and much underacknowledged Boston mystery series. Lehane's books reflect our morally complex times, when the borders between right and wrong are somewhat blurry.Private investigator Patrick Kenzie is in the middle of a personal crisis--he's lost his passion for the profession, and is tired of people with their \"predictable vices, their predictable needs and wants and dormant desires.\" Angie Gennaro, his occasional sweetheart, lifelong friend, and fellow investigator has quit the business. She's still deeply resentful about Patrick's handling of the Amanda McCready case, the focus ofGone, Baby, Gone. Without Angie, private investigating has lost its fizz.The suicide of a former client, Karen Nichols, gives Kenzie his investigative itch back. Six months earlier, Kenzie tracked down a stalker who had been harassing Nichols, and put an end to his heinous hobby. But Nichols needed more help than this PI could ever have imagined. \"She'd been drowning, and I'd been busy.\" The successful, middle-class young woman had been sinking into a sea of drugs, alcohol, and prostitution, hitting the bottom when she jumped from the Boston Custom House. Her death consumes Kenzie--he is convinced that someone pulled her into the vortex, although her nearest and dearest simply call her weak.Kenzie teams up with his explosive, loving, gun-toting friend Bubba Rogowski, and, after a boozy reunion, Angie Gennaro joins them. This fearless threesome must surely be the most original team in contemporary crime fiction. Good at the core--but seriously screwed up by various demons from their pasts--tact and decorum is hardly their style. They work their way across Boston, doing whatever it takes to question Nichols's family and acquaintances. By unveiling the real Nichols, tragic family secrets, betrayals, and conspiracies are also unmasked.If you haven't experienced Dennis Lehane's world before, be prepared for an invigorating new reading experience.--Naomi Gesinger--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",
        "0060852577": "Starred Review. Kingsolver's ambitious new novel, her first in nine years (after theThe Poisonwood Bible), focuses on Harrison William Shepherd, the product of a divorced American father and a Mexican mother. After getting kicked out of his American military academy, Harrison spends his formative years in Mexico in the 1930s in the household of Diego Rivera; his wife, Frida Kahlo; and their houseguest, Leon Trotsky, who is hiding from Soviet assassins. After Trotsky is assassinated, Harrison returns to the U.S., settling down in Asheville, N.C., where he becomes an author of historical potboilers (e.g.,Vassals of Majesty) and is later investigated as a possible subversive. Narrated in the form of letters, diary entries and newspaper clippings, the novel takes a while to get going, but once it does, it achieves a rare dramatic power that reaches its emotional peak when Harrison wittily and eloquently defends himself before the House Un-American Activities Committee (on the panel is a young Dick Nixon). Employed by the American imagination, is how one character describes Harrison, a term that could apply equally to Kingsolver as she masterfully resurrects a dark period in American history with the assured hand of a true literary artist.(Nov.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0060817089": "Labrador retrievers are generally considered even-tempered, calm and reliable;and then there's Marley, the subject of this delightful tribute to one Lab who doesn't fit the mold. Grogan, a columnist for thePhiladelphia Inquirer, and his wife, Jenny, were newly married and living in West Palm Beach when they decided that owning a dog would give them a foretaste of the parenthood they anticipated. Marley was a sweet, affectionate puppy who grew into a lovably naughty, hyperactive dog. With a light touch, the author details how Marley was kicked out of obedience school after humiliating his instructor (whom Grogan calls Miss Dominatrix) and swallowed an 18-karat solid gold necklace (Grogan describes his gross but hilarious \"recovery operation\"). With the arrival of children in the family, Marley became so incorrigible that Jenny, stressed out by a new baby, ordered her husband to get rid of him; she eventually recovered her equilibrium and relented. Grogan's chronicle of the adventures parents and children (eventually three) enjoyed with the overly energetic but endearing dog is delivered with great humor. Dog lovers will love this account of Grogan's much loved canine.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",
        "0061173975": "In this sometimes provocative, often pedantic memoir of his own attempts to answer the great theological question about the persistence of evil in the world, Ehrman, a UNC&ndash;Chapel Hill religion professor, refuses to accept the standard theological answers. Through close readings of every section of the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament, he discovers that the Bible offers numerous answers that are often contradictory. The prophets think God sends pain and suffering as a punishment for sin and also that human beings who oppress others create such misery; the writers who tell the Jesus story and the Joseph stories think God works through suffering to achieve redemptive purposes; the writers of Job view pain as God's test; and the writers of Job and Ecclesiastes conclude that we simply cannot know why we suffer. In the end, frustrated that the Bible offers such a range of opposing answers, Ehrman gives up on his Christian faith and fashions a peculiarly utilitarian solution to suffering and evil in the world: first, make this life as pleasing to ourselves as we can and then make it pleasing to others. Although Ehrman's readings of the biblical texts are instructive, he fails to convince readers that these are indeed God's problems, and he fails to advance the conversation any further than it's already come.(Mar.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0060541644": "During the three years (1993-1996) Samantha Power spent covering the grisly events in Bosnia and Srebrenica, she became increasingly frustrated with how little the United States was willing to do to counteract the genocide occurring there. After much research, she discovered a pattern: \"The United States had never in its history intervened to stop genocide and had in fact rarely even made a point of condemning it as it occurred,\" she writes in this impressive book. Debunking the notion that U.S. leaders were unaware of the horrors as they were occurring against Armenians, Jews, Cambodians, Iraqi Kurds, Rwandan Tutsis, and Bosnians during the past century, Power discusses how much was known and when, and argues that much human suffering could have been alleviated through a greater effort by the U.S. She does not claim that the U.S. alone could have prevented such horrors, but does make a convincing case that even a modest effort would have had significant impact. Based on declassified information, private papers, and interviews with more than 300 American policymakers, Power makes it clear that a lack of political will was the most significant factor for this failure to intervene. Some courageous U.S. leaders did work to combat and call attention to ethnic cleansing as it occurred, but the vast majority of politicians and diplomats ignored the issue, as did the American public, leading Power to note that \"no U.S. president has ever suffered politically for his indifference to its occurrence. It is thus no coincidence that genocide rages on.\" This powerful book is a call to make such indifference a thing of the past.--Shawn Carkonen--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

Childhood friends Tara, Katherine, and Fintan muddle along, dealing with  the indignities and inconveniences we all face--and then some. Tara's perfectly  horrible, freeloading boyfriend Thomas watches her diet like a hawk and remarks  cruelly on the size of her posterior, comparing her unfavorably to younger,  thinner women. Katherine is a professional success, but her personal life is  nonexistent. Every one of her prior relationships--six in all--has ended  disastrously, with Katherine getting dumped. Each time, she retreats further and  further into her shell, until her most intimate relationship is with her remote  control. Fashion industry insider Fintan has found true love with his Italian  boyfriend, Sandro, but a health crisis threatens their happiness. Tara,  Katherine, and Fintan, as well as their quirky cast of friends (people with  names like Lorcan and Mandii), live, love, and learn the hard way, the only way  they can. Not quite as obsessive as Bridget Jones and that damn diary of hers,  Keyes manages to convey a painfully accurate portrayal of what it means to be  single today, tempered by a few of life's less humiliating and more important  lessons, like the value of true friendship.

In this new twist on the Trojan War story, Patroclus and Achilles are the quintessential mismatched pair--a mortal underdog exiled in shame and a glorious demigod revered by all--but what would a novel of ancient Greece be without star-crossed love? Miller includes other good tragic bits--foreknowledge of death, ruthless choices that pit pride and reputation against the lives of innocents, the folly of men and gods--and through her beautiful writing my spine chilled in the presence of Achilles&#x2019; mother, the sea goddess Thetis, and I became a bystander in the battlefield of Troy awash with blood, exaltation, and despair.The Song of Achillesinfuses the essence of Homer with modern storytelling in a combination that is utterly absorbing and gratifying--I can&#x2019;t wait to see what Miller tackles next.--Seira WilsonGregory Maguire Interviews Madeline MillerGregory Maguire is the best-selling author ofConfessions of an Ugly Stepsister,Lost,Mirror Mirror,the Wicked Years, a series that includesWicked,Son of a Witch,A Lion Among Men, and most recently,Out of Oz.Gregory Maguire:Ms. Miller, you write with the confidence of the zealously inspired, taking as your material one of the great foundation texts of world literature. In three millennia,The Iliadhas garnered somewhat wider attention thanThe Wizard of Oz, with which I have played, so I have to ask: where do you get the noive? How did you come to dare to take on such a daunting task, and for your first book?Madeline Miller:A little knowledge is a dangerous thing, and in my case it was just dangerous enough to get me started. If I had stopped to ponder, I think I might have been too intimidated. But it helped that Patroclus is such an underdog&mdash;giving him voice felt like standing up for him. I had been intensely frustrated by a number of articles that kept side-stepping the love between him and Achilles, which to me felt so obviously at the story&rsquo;s heart. So I wanted to set the record straight, as I saw it.Maguire:The novel tells the story of the rise, fall and immortalization of the golden Achilles. You approach his famous story from a sideline, that of Patroclus, his bosom companion and lover. Was it hard to keep the mighty arc of legend from overwhelming shadowy Patroclus, and did you write more of him than you ended up using, just to be sure you had him firmly grounded in your mind?Miller:Definitely yes to the second. I actually spent five years writing a first draft of the novel, took a good long look at it, then threw it out and started from scratch. Even though not a word survived, that draft was an essential first step. It helped me understand the story and characters, especially Patroclus, from the inside out.As for the overwhelming legends, I actually think they worked in my favor&mdash;because Patroclus is overwhelmed by them himself.  He is this ordinary person who is pulled into a terrifying world of angry deities and destiny because of his love for Achilles.Maguire:Having glancingly heard of this legend before, I knew more or less how it would end. I had no idea how you might handle the loss of perspective and point of view when tragedy would inevitably strike. You managed to narrate an almost impossible transition from life into myth in part, I think, by your instinctual use of a combination of present and past tense, to say nothing of a masterly combining of authorial and first person observations. How many slaughtered bulls did you sacrifice, and on whose altar, to deserve the talent to risk such dangerous technique?Miller:It was a lot of bulls. And whatever ended up working, I give all the credit to my background in theater. When I first started writing, I had this idea that I should be in control of the story, forcing it forward. It never worked. What I needed to do was learn how to get in character, and write from there.It took me a long time to find just the right tone for the ending&mdash;I kept writing and throwing away, writing and throwing away. Then, in the middle of apartment-hunting, inspiration struck. All the other ideas had started out well, but would gum up before they got anywhere near the finish line. But this one kept humming right along. And it was the simplest, so there you go.Maguire:Oscar Wilde said something like, &ldquo;The Odyssey was written by Homer, or another Greek of the same name.&rdquo; But Oscar Wilde had clearly not met you. This is not a question. It is a salute.",

At 15, Mia gets involved in a dangerous drug and Wicca scene, stunning her successful, controlling mother, Claire, and stepfather, Paul. But the signs were in place earlier, after Mia's history of being sexually abused by her biological father, a violent, vindictive drug user whom Claire left with difficulty. Sent to Indiana to live with Claire's sister, Mia starts using cocaine heavily and even gets arrested. When the destructive behavior (including self-mutilation) accelerates, Claire and Paul send Mia to the unlikely Morava Academy, in the Czech Republic, a kind of Spartan military institution where 50 teens are rigorously monitored and reprogrammed. Meanwhile, back in L.A., the parents undergo an intensive group therapy called Discovery to learn to shed guilt for their daughter's behavior, and also forgive her. Oddly, Morava is soon shut down after allegations of staff abuse, but Mia goes through a brilliant turnaround at Spring Creek Lodge in Montana.

Angela begins to fall in love with the idea of Maine life just as much as she finds herself falling for Rich, and when her career suddenly goes up in flames, she moves to Mount Desert Island. Once she arrives, however, she learns that her vision of perfect New England life&mdash;and her perfect New England man&mdash;is far removed from reality.

Worlds are destroyed and cultures collide when a tsunami hits islands in a vast ocean much like the Pacific. Mau, a boy on his way back home from his initiation period and ready for the ritual that will make him a man, is the only one of his people, the Nation, to survive. Ermintrude, a girl from somewhere like Britain in a time like the 19th century, is on her way to meet her father, the governor of the Mothering Sunday islands. She is the sole survivor of her ship (or so she thinks), which is wrecked on Mau's island. She reinvents herself as Daphne, and uses her wits and practical sense to help the straggling refugees from nearby islands who start arriving. When raiders land on the island, they are led by a mutineer from the wrecked ship, and Mau must use all of his ingenuity to outsmart him. Then, just as readers are settling in to thinking that all will be well in the new world that Daphne and Mau are helping to build, Pratchett turns the story on its head. The main characters are engaging and interesting, and are the perfect medium for the author's sly humor.

A scary face-off between Jane and Lynne is both hilarious and exciting. And though the frantic and elaborate finale may leave the future of fledgling witch Jane in question, first-time author Pierce neatly leaves open a creaky, spooky door for a slew of sequels for fans of gothic social climbing and the supernatural.

SitcomSkip and Scooterco-stars Georgie York, who like her character exudes spunky charm, and Bram Shepard, whose upbringing couldn't be more different from the nice boy he plays, hate each other even before Bram's offscreen sexual escapades lead to the sitcom's cancellation. Flash forward eight years: his career has cratered, and her biggest accomplishment has been briefly marrying hunky star Lance Marks, who abandons her for sex-goddess-turned-international-do-gooder Jade Gentry. So when Bram and Georgie wake up from a Vegas bender and find themselves married to each other, they make the most of it: Georgie aims to undo the damage Lance has done to her heart and her public image, while Bram is gunning for a second chance at life, love and stardom. It's a blast to watch the hate-each-other-yet-made-for-each-other couple as they duck paparazzi or spar before falling into bed. In this massively entertaining romp, redemption is always possible, and even a fake Hollywood couple trapped in a pretend marriage might find true love.(Feb.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired. This game is clearly at its best when  there are two or more players with controllers in their hands.--Mark  BrooksPros:Fantastic graphics and sound keep the action upbeatMany new characters and other goodies to unlockCons:Single-player experience is comparatively weakToo cute for a few folksAdventure mode is boring",

The format can aptly be described asSuper Mario KartmeetsMortal Kombat, which makes for an odd, yet addictive game. The object is to throw, punch, smash, or blast your opponents off the edge of the beautifully rendered, themed arenas. Numerous power-ups, weapons, and surprises help or hinder the melee. Your eventual goal is to fight your way through to a bizarre final boss character. Victory in this battle rewards you with another character to play, such as the scene-stealing Pok&eacute;mon, Jigglypuff.From Star Fox's laser pistol to Link's hook shot, each character's trademark special abilities are utilized to knock one another off the screen. The game does a great job balancing the characters' widely differing powers so that no one character has an insurmountable advantage. The sound and animations are also dead-on: Donkey Kong is a huge, cartoonish ape, while Link is much more detailed and realistic. And Pikachu's famous thunder shock attack is accompanied by a fearsome yell of \"PIKA!\"Unlike most fighting games,Super Smash Bros.allows you to team up with a computer partner and take on other teams in both single and multiplayer modes.

        "0060528370": "According to this classic of revisionist American history, narratives of national unity and progress are a smoke screen disguising the ceaseless conflict between elites and the masses whom they oppress and exploit. Historian Zinn sides with the latter group in chronicling Indians' struggle against Europeans, blacks' struggle against racism, women's struggle against patriarchy, and workers' struggle against capitalists. First published in 1980, the volume sums up decades of post-war scholarship into a definitive statement of leftist, multicultural, anti-imperialist historiography. This edition updates that project with new chapters on the Clinton and Bush presidencies, which deplore Clinton's pro-business agenda, celebrate the 1999 Seattle anti-globalization protests and apologize for previous editions' slighting of the struggles of Latinos and gays. Zinn's work is an vital corrective to triumphalist accounts, but his uncompromising radicalism shades, at times, into cynicism. Zinn views the Bill of Rights, universal suffrage, affirmative action and collective bargaining not as fundamental (albeit imperfect) extensions of freedom, but as tactical concessions by monied elites to defuse and contain more revolutionary impulses; voting, in fact, is but the most insidious of the \"controls.\" It's too bad that Zinn dismisses two centuries of talk about \"patriotism, democracy, national interest\" as mere \"slogans\" and \"pretense,\" because the history he recounts is in large part the effort of downtrodden people to claim these ideals for their own.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.",

There are practical problems aplenty, of course, including a shortage of money and an 11-year-old son to raise. But Sam's sense of emotional bereavement is far worse, despite the fact that her husband had been giving her the conjugal cold shoulder for years:I miss David so much, yes I do, I miss the presence of another person in my bed at night, even if he doesn't touch me; the reliability of someone else being there in the morning, even if they only shave and stare straight ahead into the mirror while you lean against the bathroom doorjamb with your cup of coffee, chatting hopefully.The loneliness in her \"as constant and as irrefutable\" as circulating blood, Sam begins to rebuild her life.

Only the assistance of classmate Hallie Costa, daughter of widower Dr. Nick, pulls Gus from depression. Years later, after star football player Gus has become known as &#x201C;Voodoo&#x201D; for his winning charm, he and Hallie finally yield to what seems a lifelong love, until an incident at a beach party after the senior prom leaves Hallie seriously injured and causes Gus to join the priesthood. But even Father Gus can&#x2019;t shake a reputation for violence, leading to his wrongful conviction for murdering Ava Cilento, an abused woman who sought Gus&#x2019; counsel to protect her young daughter, then accused him of assault when she ended their alleged affair. As this epic spans decades, the third-person narration yields to the first-person account of teenager Mila Cilento, Ava&#x2019;s daughter, who uncovers the truth of what happened years earlier. By the author of The Liar&#x2019;s Diary (2007), this beautifully wrought novel is a sometimes wrenching but ultimately uplifting story of murder and betrayal in the face of faith, family in its truest sense, and&#x2014;most of all&#x2014;love. --Michele Leber",

Annabel Hayer leads a solitary life with her cat, her only activity outside work being to help out her widowed, housebound mum. Meanwhile, virtually friendless Colin Friedland combines his obsessions with sex and death with a growing interest in neurolinguistic programming (NLP), forging an all-consuming avocation. Annabel also is a crack police analyst who spots an alarming increase in the number of bodies found in their homes in various states of decomposition in the town of Briarstone, causing police to start looking for connections between the recently dead (but not murdered) and the local newspaper to launch a Love Your Neighbour campaign, urging residents to check on those living nearby. Inevitably, the two narrators connect after an unexpected event plunges Annabel into a depressed state, and Colin&#x2019;s methods&#x2014;and his keen interest in putrefaction&#x2014;are spelled out in greater detail.

        "0061727679": "Amazon Exclusive: Lee Child Interviews Jacqueline WinspearJacqueline Winspear, like her interviewer, the iconic, bestselling authorLee Child, originally hails from the United Kingdom.A Lesson in Secretsis her eighth novel featuring psychologist-investigator and former WW1 nurse, Maisie Dobbs.  Here she talks with Child about her work on the series, and her enduring interest in the aftermath of WW1.Lee Child:People are often surprised that I'm a huge Maisie Dobbs fan, because Jack Reacher is all about a kind of Spartan American masculinity, and Maisie Dobbs is all about a kind of feminine English refinement.  But they're both strong, unconventional people.  Perhaps that's the cross-genre appeal?  Do you find that Maisie attracts an unusual mix of readers?Jacqueline Winspear:I&rsquo;m thrilled you&rsquo;re such a Maisie Dobbs fan--and you can count me among those millions of Jack Reacher fans.  Maisie and Reacher are both unconventional, but I believe another factor in their cross-genre appeal is that both have endured life-changing challenges.  Maisie attracts diverse readers: men and women, all age groups, veterans, nurses, college students, people who have faced troubles, and people interested in the era.LC:And in fact your novels are driven by violence far worse than mine--off the page, granted, but there&rsquo;s no getting around the fact that at the heart of your books is the aftermath of a horrendous war, with its attendant violence and death.  How do you see the role of violence in your novels?JW:I think you hit the theme there with &ldquo;aftermath.&rdquo;  The violence in my books is that searing, painful residue left by the passing of a terrible time, when people were also crushed emotionally by the deep losses over a four-year period.  In addition, there&rsquo;s that element of violence that lingers--inAmong the Mad, for example--when war&rsquo;s tentacles will not let go.  We see that again today in the stories of veterans who are still fighting their wars, but the conflict is raging inside them.LC:As a kid in England I remember seeing hundreds of maimed old men, and hundreds of lonely old women.  My grandfather was an example of the first, and two great-aunts examples of the second - sad reminders of a terrible time.  Was it something similar that drew you to the First World War and the &ldquo;Between the Wars&rdquo; era that followed?JW:I have the same memories--my grandfather was wounded at the Battle of the Somme, and my grandmother was partially blinded at the Woolwich Arsenal, in an explosion that wounded her sister and killed several girls working alongside her. There were the elderly spinsters in my neighborhood, and for each there was that old sepia photograph on the mantelpiece, of a sweetheart or brother lost to war. Those childhood memories led me to think a lot about what happens after war is done.  As a character says inBirds of a Feather, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the trouble with war; it lives on inside the living.&rdquo;LC:I was introduced to Maisie Dobbs by my wife, who passed through an airport and picked up the first in the series.  She loved it, and urged me to read it, and I'm glad I did.  It's one of the very, very few series we both love equally--in fact, perhaps the only one.  Is this typical of your readers?JW:I receive so many emails from fans who tell me that the books are read by all members of the family. And many women tell me that it was their husband who first discovered Maisie.  The books are as accessible to readers aged about fourteen as they are to seniors. There are few things today that all age groups within a family can engage in, discuss and get excited about, so it&rsquo;s lovely when I hear that family members are awaiting the next book so they can all read it.LC:Maisie is definitively feminine, but she's running a business, and poking around in a \"man's world,\" which is true to the times, and indicative of the early stages of feminism in the West.  Was that something you wanted to explore?JW:It would have been difficult to introduce a character such as Maisie and not explore the fact that the Great War left so many women to forge a life alone.  If there was one thing I wanted to do, it was to bring the spirit of that generation to the character of Maisie Dobbs.  Of course, some women floundered and lived lonely lives, but there were a great many who blazed a trail.  I believe an archetype was born at that time--the stoic British woman who is independent and more than a little opinionated, with a heart of gold under a tough exterior, and who knows what it is to endure.  Dame Maggie Smith has played that character in several films.LC:Maisie understands human psychology in a way that seems to be an early and experimental pre-echo of what we'd now call criminal profiling.  It's a huge part of both her process and her appeal.  Where did that come from?JW:That developed in a very organic way.  Having established her as a &ldquo;sensitive,&rdquo; I wanted to give her real expertise--and there are historical underpinnings to this aspect of her character.  Maisie studied the Moral Sciences curriculum at Girton College when psychology was in its infancy.  I have the prospectus from 1913, and about one third of the course was the study of modern psychology. It was a time of great experimentation, so Maisie&rsquo;s processes have their roots in real practices considered innovative at the time.LC:One of your decisions I admire is the way you have moved the series forward in time so firmly. Most writers would have continued mining the same immediate post-war seam forever.  What was your thinking behind that?  And how do you keep the character fresh as the series itself develops?JW:I once heard you say at a conference, &ldquo;The reader comes back to a series, not to find out what the sleuth does with the case, but what the case does to the sleuth.&rdquo;  I agree.  We are all impacted not only by our past, but by our current circumstances and those around us.  You always put Reacher in a new area, be it small town or big city; and through his wandering we learn a lot about him. I work with the geography of time. Not everyone likes change and many readers would like Maisie Dobbs to stay as she is in a given book.  But life&rsquo;s not like that--the goalposts tend to move when we are at our most comfortable, and I want to keep the series fresh.LC:I&rsquo;m often asked if I have a favorite book within my series, so now I&rsquo;m turning the tables:  Do you have favorites among your novels?JW:That&rsquo;s such a difficult question, because each book not only represents a different place on my journey as a writer, but has been inspired by something that touched me.  I thinkMaisie Dobbswill always be very tightly held in my affections, because it was my first book and was written at a difficult time in my life, when I was recovering from a horrible accident.  The other choice would be TheMapping of Love and Death, because it was inspired by the true story of a soldier whose remains lay under Belgian soil for some 90 years until unearthed by a farmer. I learned more about him when I became involved in the quest to discover his origins.  When I look at that book, I think of a young man lost to war who was never identified and who was eventually laid to rest as &ldquo;A Soldier of The Great War, Known Unto God.&rdquo; I ache for the parents who never knew where their son died, for he had probably been listed as &ldquo;Missing, Presumed Dead.&rdquo;",

        "0060794410": "Five years ago, Jim Collins asked the question, \"Can a good company become a great company and if so, how?\" InGood to GreatCollins, the author ofBuilt to Last, concludes that it is possible, but finds there are no silver bullets. Collins and his team of researchers began their quest by sorting through a list of 1,435 companies, looking for those that made substantial improvements in their performance over time. They finally settled on 11--including Fannie Mae, Gillette, Walgreens, and Wells Fargo--and discovered common traits that challenged many of the conventional notions of corporate success. Making the transition from good to great doesn't require a high-profile CEO, the latest technology, innovative change management, or even a fine-tuned business strategy. At the heart of those rare and truly great companies was a corporate culture that rigorously found and promoted disciplined people to think and act in a disciplined manner. Peppered with dozens of stories and examples from the great and not so great, the book offers a well-reasoned road map to excellence that any organization would do well to consider.

        "0060577304": "Journalist Bergreen, who has penned biographies of James Agee, Louis Armstrong, Irving Berlin and Al Capone, superbly recreates Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan's obsessive 16th-century quest, an ill-fated journey that altered Europe's perception of the planet: \"It was a dream as old as the imagination: a voyage to the ends of the earth.... Mariners feared they could literally sail over the edge of the world.\" In 2001, Bergreen traveled the South American strait that bears Magellan's name, and he adds to that firsthand knowledge satellite images of Magellan's route plus international archival research. His day-by-day account incorporates the testimony of sailors, Francisco Albo's pilot's log and the eyewitness accounts of Venetian scholar Antonio Pigafetta, who was on the journey. Magellan's mission for Spain was to find a water route to the fabled Spice Islands, and in 1519, the Armada de Molucca (five ships and some 260 sailors) sailed into the pages of history. Many misfortunes befell the expedition, including the brutal killing of Magellan in the Philippines. Three years later, one weather-beaten ship, \"a vessel of desolation and anguish,\" returned to Spain with a skeleton crew of 18, yet \"what a story those few survivors had to tell-a tale of mutiny, of orgies on distant shores, and of the exploration of the entire globe,\" providing proof that the world was round.

Her febrile prose is especially appropriate to a story as turbulent as the tumultuous waters that have claimed many lives over the years. Widowed on her wedding night when her new husband, a young minister and latent homosexual, throws himself into the falls, Ariah Littrell, the plain, awkward daughter of a minister, henceforth considers herself damned. Her bleak future becomes miraculously bright when Dirk Burnaby, a handsome, wealthy bon vivant with an altruistic heart, falls in love with the media-dubbed Widow-Bride. Their rapturous happiness is shadowed only by Ariah's illogical conviction over the years that Dirk will leave her and their three children someday. Her unreasonable fear becomes self-fulfilling when her increasingly unstable behavior, combined with Dirk's obsessed but chaste involvement with Nina Olshaker, a young mother who enlists his help in alerting the city fathers to the pestilential conditions in the area later to be known as Love Canal, opens a chasm in their marriage. His gentle heart inspired by a need for justice, Dirk takes on the powerful, corrupt politicians, his former peers and pals, in a disastrous lawsuit that ruins him socially and financially and results in his death. Oates adroitly addresses the material of this \"first\" class action lawsuit and makes the story fresh and immediate. \"In the end, all drama is about family,\" a character muses, and while the narrative occasionally lapses into melodrama in elucidating this theme, Oates spins a haunting story in which nature and humans are equally rapacious and self-destructive.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Her dialogue sparkles with sassy wit and earthy poetry; her  descriptions are rooted in daily life but are also on familiar terms with the  eternal. WithProdigal Summer, she returns fromthe Congoto a \"wrinkle on the map  that lies between farms and wildness.\" And there, in an isolated pocket of  southern Appalachia, she recounts not one but three intricate stories.Exuberant, lush, riotous--the summer of the novel is \"the season of extravagant  procreation\" in which bullfrogs carelessly lay their jellied masses of eggs in  the grass, \"apparently confident that their tadpoles would be able to swim  through the lawn like little sperms,\" and in which a woman may learn to \"tell  time with her skin.\" It is also the summer in which a family of coyotes moves  into the mountains above Zebulon Valley:The ghost of a creature long extinct was coming in on silent footprints,  returning to the place it had once held in the complex anatomy of this forest  like a beating heart returned to its body. This is what she believed she would  see, if she watched, at this magical juncture: a restoration.The \"she\" is Deanna Wolfe, a wildlife biologist observing the coyotes from her  isolated aerie--isolated, that is, until the arrival of a young hunter who makes  her even more aware of the truth that humans are only an infinitesimal portion  in the ecological balance. This truth forms the axis around which the other two  narratives revolve: the story of a city girl, entomologist, and new widow and  her efforts to find a place for herself; and the story of Garnett Walker and  Nannie Rawley, who seem bent on thrashing out the countless intimate lessons of  biology as only an irascible traditional farmer and a devotee of organic  agriculture can. As Nannie lectures Garnett, \"Everything alive is connected to  every other by fine, invisible threads. Things you don't see can help you  plenty, and things you try to control will often rear back and bite you, and  that's the moral of the story.\"Structurally, that gossamer webisthe story: images, phrases, and events  link the narratives, and these echoes are rarely obvious, always serendipitous.  Kingsolver is one of those authors for whom the terrifying elegance of nature is  both aesthetic wonder and source of a fierce and abiding moral vision. She may  have inherited Thoreau's mantle, but she piles up riches of her own making,  blending her extravagant narrative gift with benevolent concise humor. She  treads the line between the sentimental and the glorious like nobody else in  American literature.--Kelly Flynn--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",
        "0061728918": "Grade 9 Up&mdash;In the 1980s, Carrie Bradshaw is the oldest of three girls who live with their widowed father. She is on the swim team, wants to attend a summer writing program in New York, has applied to Brown, and is the last of her girlfriends to still have her virginity. When the rakish Sebastian Kydd returns to town, all the girls in the school become distracted, but he seems to have his eye on Carrie, at least until her best friend begins to take notice of him. The action is lightweight: senior pranks are played, dates are prevalent, friendships are tested, and Carrie keeps letting boys run rampant over her. It takes most of the book for her to stand up for herself. This protagonist is clearly written to resemble her older self as portrayed in the TV seriesSex and the City. She spends the novel questioning relationships; worrying about friendships; developing a funky, independent sense of fashion; flirting with boys while dating two at once; and having a gay male friend. The author is known for writing frivolous, adult chick-lit books and she does not stray from that style here. While toning down the antics that take place in her adult books, she still writes about partying, drinking, smoking (cigarettes and dope), sex, and shoplifting, making this book best suited to older teens looking for a diversion.&mdash;Geri Diorio, The Ridgefield Library, CTCopyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Echoes of Yossarian, the wise-ass bombardier who was too smart to die but not smart enough to find a way out of his predicament, could be heard throughout the counterculture. As a result, it's impossible not to considerCatch-22to be something of a period piece. But 40 years on, the  novel's undiminished strength is its looking-glass logic. Again and again, Heller's characters demonstrate that what is commonly held to be good, is bad; what is sensible, is nonsense.Yossarian says, &quot;You're talking about winning the war, and I am talking about winning the war and keeping alive.&quot;&quot;Exactly,&quot; Clevinger snapped smugly. &quot;And which do you think is more important?&quot;&quot;To whom?&quot; Yossarian shot back. &quot;It doesn't make a damn bit of difference who wins the war to someone who's dead.&quot;&quot;I can't think of another attitude that could be depended upon to give greater comfort to the enemy.&quot;&quot;The enemy,&quot; retorted Yossarian with weighted precision, &quot;is anybody who's going to get you killed, no matter which side he's on.&quot;Mirabile dictu, the book holds up post-Reagan, post-Gulf War. It's a good thing, too. As long as there's a military, that engine of lethal authority,Catch-22will shine as a handbook for smart-alecky pacifists.

This goth-girl is obsessed with vampires and when a new family moves into the old town mansion, she is convinced that the son, Alexander, is a vampire. The story swirls around and through sibling rivalry, peer relationships, friendships, and love. Raven is a feisty protagonist with a quick wit and a real sense of self. She defends herself and her friends, often besting her peers with humor and a quick tongue. As her connection with Alexander deepens, she comes to understand her family better. It is through his shadowy character that readers are kept off balance. Schreiber weaves a tale that is more about acceptance and friendship than about vampire behavior and culture, and sustains a tone that draws readers to the characters rather than to horrific plot developments that would keep them reading. There is far less intensity than in Annette Curtis Klause's Silver Kiss (Laurel-Leaf, 1992) and less moodiness than that found in Amelia Atwater-Rhodes's Midnight Predator (2002) and Shattered Mirror (2001, both Delacorte).

        "B0000696CZ": "How big is this game? Even publicists forother gamesend up talking aboutVice Citywhen they call our office, babbling in the same helplessly intoxicated way that afflicts everyone who plays it. The achievement ofVice City(which, as everyone knows by now, is set in the 1980s and offers an all-new,Miami Vice-inspired story) is not only that it manages to live up to an absurd level of expectation, but that it takes the game places that fans of its predecessorGrand Theft Auto 3never dreamed of, and that it achieves this astonishing level of innovation without losing anything that madeGTA3the bestselling PS2 game of all time.After a brilliant homage to the era of the Commodore 64 in the opening credits, the first thing you'll notice is the improved graphics, which are smoother and more detailed, and--with effects like neon lights reflected on rain-slick streets, and intense Florida sunlight--have a lush, tropical look that immediately gives you a strong sense of place. The architecture is more fabulous by tenfold, with art deco buildings, high-rise hotels, and believably seedy back alleys. The control scheme is essentially the same as inGTA3, but the cars handle much better, and in pedestrian mode there is a new crouch move. You will have access to fast, great-handling cars right away, as opposed toGTA3which made you unlock the second island before you could get your hands on any respectable wheels. This game has such riches to offer that there is no need to be chintzy with the vehicles.Cops are more vigilant this time--minor offenses like whacking innocent bystanders will more often than not get you a two-star wanted level--and are harder to elude (though they still can't seem to climb stairs or negotiate sharp turns). So while free-roaming exploration is as fun as ever, there is more incentive to perform the missions instead of randomly raising hell. Not that that's a bad thing: even lazy criminals like myself (inGTA3, I would rather toss hand grenades into traffic than follow orders from some rude Mafia boss) will be quickly caught up in the vivid characters and hilarious, fascinating story, in which you play an acid-washed-jeans-wearing thug named Tommy Vercetti. Where inGTA3missions were blocky, schematic affairs only nominally connected to the story, this time tasks move the story briskly along and deftly blend cinematics and game action. For example, there is a scene of a character throwing Tommy a gun, at which point you are suddenly thrown back into the action and must make an instant decision about whom to trust and what to do.There are more, and more detailed, indoor environments, including a hotel, police station, and mall (a slight downside to this is that some of the more elaborate indoor environments require load times). The layout of the city, with tons of backyards, narrow alleys, and fire escapes, encourages creativity when eluding pursuit, as does greater access to rooftops. Get your motorcycle up the fire escape and a whole new world of action is possible, including... well, use your imagination.This overview barely scratches the surface of theVice Cityexperience, its colorful explosion of music, clothes, combat, and brilliant voice acting, not to mention the plot twist midway through the game that changes the very nature of the game itself. Though it was the outrageous, amoral violence that got all the press, the essential genius ofGTA3was its intoxicating blend of script and open-ended action.

As the  world's smallest video-game platform, the Game Boy Advance SP is also the first to use a built-in rechargeable battery.Many decried the original Game Boy Advance's reflective LCD screen and its reliance on external light sources. The Game Boy Advance SP's main feature--optional backlighting--fixes this complaint nicely, but it's the wealth of other features that makes this system so surprisingly good.At first look, you might think the SP is a sleek travel alarm clock. When closed, it's just as tall and deep as the original GBA, but only half as wide. Due to its clamshell design, the screen is always protected from everyday scratches. A small button in the center of the console turns on the backlighting element for use in low-light situations, like in a moving car.The SP comes with a well-designed power adapter that recharges a built-in battery; its prongs fold in for easier storage. Our informal tests found that it takes about four hours to fully charge (you can even play it while it's plugged in and charging), and the battery lasts about 11 hours with the backlighting constantly on--your results may vary. Using the backlighting less often will conserve battery power.Withseparately sold  cables, you can connect the Game Boy Advance SP to other GBAs  for multiplayer gaming (above) or to theNintendo GameCube(below) to access secret levels, exchange data, or use other special  features that vary from game to game.The quality of the backlighting is very good. It's bright and clear when looking directly at it, but degraded from other angles. This is only a problem for friends who are watching the screen from over your shoulder.But size, power, and affordability do not come without trade offs. There's no headphone jack here, though Nintendo promises an adapter. The system isn't very loud at its highest volume, and the sound can be turned down to socially acceptable levels. The L and R shoulder buttons are a fraction of the size they were on the GBA, and thus are harder to hit. Also, the reduced size of the SP is slightly less comfortable for adult hands than the GBA, but perhaps more comfortable for smaller hands. The cartridge port placement on the lower part of the console is fine for GBA games, since they are flush with the console body, but older Game Boy Color carts will stick out in a way that takes some getting used to.Open it up and the hinge will seek out a preferred, pre-set angle (about 150 degrees), though you can open it a bit wider or narrower for your own comfort. The hinge stands up well to lateral pressure, and over all, the SP seems just as rugged as its predecessor--which has proven to be very rugged, indeed.--Porter B.

Scott Fitzgerald announced his decision to write &quot;somethingnew--something extraordinary and beautiful and simple + intricately patterned.&quot; That extraordinary, beautiful, intricately patterned, and above all, simple novel becameThe Great Gatsby, arguably Fitzgerald's finest work and certainly the book for which he is best known. A portrait of the Jazz Age in all of its decadence and excess,Gatsbycaptured the spirit of the author's generation and earned itself a permanent place in American mythology. Self-made, self-invented millionaire Jay Gatsby embodies some of Fitzgerald's--and his country's--most abiding obsessions: money, ambition, greed, and the promise of new beginnings. &quot;Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther.... And one fine morning--&quot; Gatsby's rise to glory and eventual fall from grace becomes a kind of cautionary tale about the American Dream.It's also a love story, of sorts, the narrative of Gatsby's quixotic passion for Daisy Buchanan. The pair meet five years before the novel begins, when Daisy is a legendary young Louisville beauty and Gatsby an impoverished officer. They fall in love, but while Gatsby serves overseas, Daisy marries the brutal, bullying, but extremely rich Tom Buchanan. After the war, Gatsby devotes himself blindly to the pursuit of wealth by whatever means--and to the pursuit of Daisy, which amounts to the same thing. &quot;Her voice is full of money,&quot; Gatsby says admiringly, in one of the novel's more famous descriptions. His millions made, Gatsby buys a mansion across Long Island Sound from Daisy's patrician East Egg address, throws lavish parties, and waits for her to appear. When she does, events unfold with all the tragic inevitability of a Greek drama, with detached, cynical neighbor Nick Carraway acting as chorus throughout.

        "0061962163": "Product DescriptionA mysterious jewel holds the key to a life-changing secret, in this breathtaking tale of love and art, betrayal and redemption.When she decides to auction her remarkable jewelry collection, Nina Revskaya, once a great star of the Bolshoi Ballet, believes she has finally drawn a curtain on her past. Instead, the former ballerina finds herself overwhelmed by memories of her homeland and of the events, both glorious and heartbreaking, that changed the course of her life half a century ago.It was in Russia that she discovered the magic of the theater; that she fell in love with the poet Viktor Elsin; that she and her dearest companions&mdash;Gersh, a brilliant composer, and the exquisite Vera, Nina&rsquo;s closest friend&mdash;became victims of Stalinist aggression. And it was in Russia that a terrible discovery incited a deadly act of betrayal&mdash;and an ingenious escape that led Nina to the West and eventually to Boston.Nina has kept her secrets for half a lifetime. But two people will not let the past rest: Drew Brooks, an inquisitive young associate at a Boston auction house, and Grigori Solodin, a professor of Russian who believes that a unique set of jewels may hold the key to his own ambiguous past. Together these unlikely partners begin to unravel a mystery surrounding a love letter, a poem, and a necklace of unknown provenance, setting in motion a series of revelations that will have life-altering consequences for them all.A Q&amp;A with Author Daphne KalotayQ:Russian Winterincludes a cast of fascinating characters. Were any of these diverse characters modeled after anyone specific?Kalotay:The central protagonist, Nina Revskaya (a ballerina) and her mother-in-law (the former aristocrat) are both modeled on relatives of mine.Nina is in some ways based on my Hungarian grandmother.  Now 93 years old, she too has a very strong personality, and I see in her the same fiery strength Nina exhibits.  My grandmother is a more joyous and loving person than Nina, but once she decides she doesn&rsquo;t like someone, that&rsquo;s it; she is very headstrong, and I&rsquo;ve glimpsed the way that she decides that certain people are her enemies.  It&rsquo;s a quality that has long intrigued me.Q:Your family were Holocaust survivors and escaped from behind the Iron Curtain&mdash;Hungary&mdash;in 1956. How did that background influence the story?Kalotay:I suppose the most profound way my family&rsquo;s history influenced my novel is&mdash;ironically&mdash;that I tried to avoid that history and transfer it to another place and time, rather than address it directly.  Just as my father never speaks of his experience of the Holocaust, I&rsquo;ve chosen not to write in a direct way about that topic or about my father&rsquo;s childhood in post-war Hungary, though that experience has of course informed so much of my family&rsquo;s trajectory and personality.  I&rsquo;ve long heard recollections of my grandmother, aunt, and father&rsquo;s life in Soviet-occupied Hungary, and in the 1980&rsquo;s I saw for myself what life under communism was like there.  But, perhaps because that experience still isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;mine,&rdquo; I felt more comfortable transporting those realities to the harsher world of Soviet Russia.Q:You worked onRussian Winterfor six years.  What was the most difficult aspect of writing the novel?  What kind of research did you do?Kalotay:The most difficult part of writing this book was figuring out how to allow my imagination to run free when in fact the constraints of Stalinist society meant fewer possibilities for what characters might say or do, or where they might go, than in an open society.  I felt very restrained by the basic logistics of a world where everyone is fearful and being reported on and can&rsquo;t just go off and do whatever they like.In order to get a better sense of this, I did a lot of reading, mostly memoirs and biographies by artists and intellectuals who had experienced that era, or by Westerners who had travelled behind the Iron Curtain during that time (though of course their experience was quite different.) I also made a visit to Russia, but that was after I&rsquo;d finished writing.Q:Russian Winteris an evocative portrait of life in the Soviet Union under Stalin, a time and place where politics and art were inextricably intertwined.  How did Stalin use art to further his goals, and do you see any similarities here in the West of today?Kalotay:Stalin understood, on the most basic level, that a beautiful ballet can be uplifting even when the realities of life are very harsh, and that a well-choreographed parade with dance and acrobatics really can instill national pride and dispel doubts.In a way it&rsquo;s amazing to think that in America most artists and writers like myself never have to give a thought to whether or not their work is going get them in trouble.  Our censors are the hoops we have to jump through to get published or have a show produced or a painting shown.  Our gatekeepers aren&rsquo;t politicians; they&rsquo;re editors or producers, and the tyranny isn&rsquo;t politics but what&rsquo;s in vogue, or what&rsquo;s cheapest to produce, or what the marketing folks think will make money.  And yet it&rsquo;s a capitalist society that allows us the privilege to make any sort of art we want, whether or not anyone notices it or pays attention.Q:When you began the novel did you have the ending in mind, or did the story lead you?Kalotay:I knew what Nina&rsquo;s general trajectory would be, and that the professor&rsquo;s original assumptions would turn out to be somehow incorrect, because I&rsquo;d already written a short story that ended that way.  But I didn&rsquo;t know exactly how it would all come together, plot-wise, or what kind of rapprochement would be possible for my characters.  There were also a lot of logistics I had to figure out&mdash;such as how, specifically, my dancer would manage to get out of the Soviet Union.Q:What does artistic freedom mean to you?Kalotay:For me it means being able to write what I want.  Here our freedom is tied not so much to political realities as financial ones, and I think people like myself worry more that we won&rsquo;t necessarily be &ldquo;allowed&rdquo; to write what we want (in my case smaller, understated novels rather than flashy, sensational or trendy ones) without losing the support of the publishing world.(Photo by Jeremy Saladyga)",
        "0060724226": "Before Elmore Leonard abandoned westerns to blaze across the pantheon of bestsellerdom with his hip, stylish thrillers, punctuated with dead-pan humor and dialogue worthy of a David Mamet play, he might have writtenThe Hot Kid; it has some of the same crisp pacing and well-defined, if not especially complex, characters that marked his earlier novels. A show-down between Tulsa oil wildcatter and millionaire Oris Belmont and his 18-year-old son, who's attempting to shake him down, says all there is to say about both men:\"I don&#x92;t know what's wrong with you. You're a nice-looking boy, wear a clean shirt every day, keep your hair combed ... where'd you get your ugly disposition? Your mama blames me for not being around, so then I give you things .. you get in trouble, I get you out. Well, now you've moved on to extortion in your life of crime ... I pay you what you want or you're telling everybody I have a girlfriend?\"Jack Belmont's blackmail scheme doesn't work, but after destroying his father's property, forging checks in his name, kidnapping his mistress, and joining a gang of notorious bank robbers after his release from prison, he encounters another man trying to get out from under his father's large shadow and create his own, bigger one.  Deputy U.S. Marshal Carl Webster, who at age 15 shot a man trying to steal his cows and six years later dispenses equal justice to Emmet Long, the leader of Belmont's gang, now has Jack Belmont in his sights. Webster's exploits have earned him even more celebrity than Jack, who dreams of rivaling Pretty Boy Floyd as public enemy number one.We&#x92;re in the early 30's here, just as a dust cloud is rolling across the Oklahoma plains--the days of Bonnie and Clyde, when gangsters captured the public attention, and Leonard makes good use of place and time. His minor characters are much more interesting than his protagonists, especially the women, and the writing shows occasional flashes of his trademarked ironic humor. But it's not as cool--or as hot--as even his most dedicated readers are used to, and there's barely a trace of the bizarre plot twists and unlikely coincidences that define his most recent caper novels in this one.--Jane Adams",

As Maya&#x2019;s grandmother, Nidia, sends her into protective custody on Chilo&#xE9;, an island off Chile&#x2019;s southern coast, she hands her a notebook in which this imperiled and irascible 19-year-old records her wrenching story. Fair and tall, Maya does not resemble her Chilean side, neither her absentee pilot father nor tough-love Berkeley activist Nidia, but, rather, her Danish flight-attendant mother, who left her newborn with her in-laws. To further complicate matters, Maya&#x2019;s guiding light was her grandfather, Nidia&#x2019;s second husband, a wise and loving African American astronomer. It is his death that precipitates the &#x201C;voyage to the underworld&#x201D; of addiction, crime, and homelessness that nearly kills her. Maya alternates between recounting her past and reporting on her gradual acclimation to Chilo&#xE9;, a microcosm of Chile&#x2019;s cultural and spiritual splendor and traumatic and tragic history.

You see, there was a bit of a mixup when the Antichrist was born, due in part to the machinations of Crowley, who did not so much fall as saunter  downwards, and in part to the mysterious ways as manifested in the form of a part-time rare book dealer, an angel named Aziraphale.  Like top agents everywhere, they've long had more in common with each other than the sides they represent, or the conflict they are nominally engaged in.  The only person  who knows how it will all end is Agnes Nutter, a witch whose  prophecies all come true, if one can only manage to decipher them. The minor characters along the way (Famine makes an appearance as diet crazes, no-calorie food and anorexia epidemics) are as much fun as the story as a whole, which adds up to one of those rare books which is enormous fun to read  the first time, and the second time, and the third time...--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

When debonair starting quarterback Dean Robillard, on a soul-searching road trip after a serious shoulder injury, happens across Blue Bailey, walking alongside the road wearing a beaver costume, he stops to help her. Blue is far from a Barbie-esque football groupie, but broke and stranded, she needs both a ride and a job, and the football all-star (driving a sexy Aston Martin) poses an interesting opportunity. As the two travel from Colorado to Dean's new farmhouse in east Tennessee, Blue resists his advances, and both athlete and vagabond struggle with deeply rooted trust and familial issues that are soon exacerbated by the unexpected presence of Dean's mother at the farm. While the verbal sparring in this textbook case of opposites attracting feels stagy at first, the rough edges come together in an alluring way.(Feb.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

When the cops learn that a murdered man with a sordid personal history has links to one of Arizona's most prominent judges, Joanna's investigation turns up a connection to an early case of her late father's, an honored sheriff. Next, the brutal beating of Jeannine Phillips, an Animal Control officer, leads the sheriff's department, its staff already stretched thin, to a confrontation with a notorious ranching family and suspected illegal immigrants. Then Joanna's obnoxious in-laws arrive for the imminent birth. In a heart-stopping climax, Joanna shoots a suspect as he tries to kidnap two children.

Erdrich's 13th novel, a multigenerational tour de force of sin, redemption, murder and vengeance, finds its roots in the 1911 slaughter of a farming family near Pluto, N.Dak. The family's infant daughter is spared, and a posse forms, incorrectly blames three Indians and lynches them. One, Mooshum Milk, miraculously survives. Over the next century, descendants of both the hanged men and the lynch mob develop relationships that become deeply entangled, and their disparate stories are held together via principal narrator Evelina, Mooshum Milk's granddaughter, who comes of age on an Indian reservation near Pluto in the 1960s and '70s and forms two fateful adolescent crushes: one on bad-boy schoolmate Corwin Peace and one on a nun. Though Evelina doesn't know it, both are descendants of lynch mob members. The plot splinters as Evelina enrolls in college and finds work at a mental asylum; Corwin spirals into a life of crime; and a long-lost violin (its backstory is another beautiful piece of the mosaic) takes on massive significance. Erdrich plays individual narratives off one another, dropping apparently insignificant clues that build to head-slapping revelations as fates intertwine and the person responsible for the 1911 killing is identified.(May)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "006073132X": "Economics is not widely considered to be one of the sexier sciences. The annual Nobel Prize winner in that field never receives as much publicity as his or her compatriots in peace, literature, or physics. But if such slights are based on the notion that economics is dull, or that economists are concerned only with finance itself, Steven D. Levitt will change some minds. InFreakonomics(written with Stephen J. Dubner), Levitt argues that many apparent mysteries of everyday life don't need to be so mysterious: they could be illuminated and made even more fascinating by asking the right questions and drawing connections. For example, Levitt traces the drop in violent crime rates to a drop in violent criminals and, digging further, to the Roe v. Wade decision that preempted the existence of some people who would be born to poverty and hardship. Elsewhere, by analyzing data gathered from inner-city Chicago drug-dealing gangs, Levitt outlines a corporate structure much like McDonald's, where the top bosses make great money while scores of underlings make something below minimum wage. And in a section that may alarm or relieve worried parents, Levitt argues that parenting methods don't really matter much and that a backyard swimming pool is much more dangerous than a gun. These enlightening chapters are separated by effusive passages from Dubner's 2003 profile of Levitt inThe New York Times Magazine, which led to the book being written. In a book filled with bold logic, such back-patting veersFreakonomics, however briefly, away from what Levitt actually has to say. Although maybe there's a good economic reason for that too, and we're just not getting it yet.--John Moe",

He is the creator of the Sandman series of graphic novels and author of the short-fiction collectionsSmoke and Mirrors and Fragile Things.Neil Gaiman:Where did the idea forSnufforiginate?Terry Pratchett:I haven&rsquo;t a clue, but I think I started out by considering the character of Sir Samuel Vimes, as he now is, and since I find his inner monologue interesting I decided to use the old and well-tried plot device of sending a policeman on holiday somewhere he can relax, because we all know the way this one is supposed to go. And then I realised that moving Vimes out of his city element and away from his comfort zone was going to be a sheer treat to write.Gaiman:The Watch fascinate me. You get to do hardboiled police procedurals while still writing funny smart books set in a fantastic world.Pratchett:On a point of order, Mister Gaiman, the world in which Sam Vimes finds himself is hardly fantastic. Okay, there are goblins, but the overall ambience is that of the shires of Middle England. It&rsquo;s all about the commonality of humankind. Shove Sam Vimes into a situation that has gone toxic and away he goes, as realistic as any other policeman and thinking in the very same ways and being Sam Vimes, questioning his motives and procedures all the way through.Gaiman:Did you really say in a previous interview that you&rsquo;d like to be like Sam Vines? Why?Pratchett:I don&rsquo;t think I actually said that, but you know how it is and &lsquo;how it is&rsquo; changes as you get older. The author can always delve into his own personality and find aspects of himself with which he can dress his characters. If you pushed me I would say that ever since I stood up and talked about my Alzheimer&rsquo;s I have been a public figure; I visited Downing Street twice, wrote angry letters to theTimes, got into debates in the House of Commons, and generally became a geezer to the extent that I sit here sometimes bewildered and think to myself, &ldquo;Actually, your job is to sit here writing another book.  Changing the world is forotherpeople...&rdquo; and then I come back to myself with, &ldquo;No it isn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; And so, bearing in mind that these days, people call a kid from the council houses &ldquo;Sir&rdquo; allows me to create a mindset for Vimes.Gaiman:On a piece about writing in theNew York Times, Carl Hiaasen (a writer you started me reading on theGood Omenstour), wrote, &ldquo;Every writer scrounges for inspiration in different places, and there's no shame in raiding the headlines. It's necessary, in fact, when attempting contemporary satire. Sharp-edged humor relies on topical reference points... Unfortunately for novelists, real life is getting way too funny and far-fetched.&rdquo;  Does the Discworld as a setting allow you to escape from that? Or is it a tool that lets you raid the headlines in ways people might not expect?Pratchett:I think that&rsquo;s the commonality of humankind again. I hope that everyone in Discworld is a recognisable and understandable character and so sometimes I can present them with modern and contemporary problems, such as Mustrum Ridcully getting his head around homosexuality.In truth, I never have to go looking for this stuff; I turn to find it smacking me in the face. I was very pleased whenMaking Moneycame out just before the banking crisis and everyone said I had predicted it. It was hardly difficult.Gaiman:How has the Discworld changed over the years?Pratchett:I suppose the simple answer is that there is still humour, but the gags are no longer set up; they are derived from characters&rsquo; personalities and situations. These days the humour seems to arrive of its own accord.Gaiman:How has writing the Discworld novels changed how you see the world?Pratchett:I think it more true that getting older changes how you see the world. There is stuff inSnuff, for example, that I couldn&rsquo;t have written at 25. Although I had written things before Discworld, I really leaned writing, on the job as it were, on Discworld. I think that the books are, if not serious, dealing with more serious subjects. These days it&rsquo;s not just for laughs. My world view had changed; sometimes I feel that the world is made up of sensible people who know that plot and bloody idiots who don&rsquo;t. Of course, all Discworld fans know the plot by heart!Gaiman:How has writing the Discworld novels changed how the world sees you?Pratchett:Has it? My agent pointed out one day that I had been quoted by a columnist in some American newspaper, and he noted with some glee that they simply identified me by name without reminding people who I was, apparently in the clear expectation that their readers would know who I am. I have quite a large number of honorary doctorates; I am a professor of English at Trinity College Dublin and a fellow of King&rsquo;s College London, on top of all the other stuff, including the knighthood. However, when it gets to the sub-editors I am always going to be that writer of wacky fantasy, though I have to say that dismissiveness is getting rarer and rarer.Gaiman:Are you respectable?Pratchett:Is this a trick question? If so, then I shall say yes. Generally speaking I try to obey the law, pay my taxes (of which there are an enormous lot), give to charity, and write letters to theTimesthat they print.It&rsquo;s a weird term, respectable; isn&rsquo;t &lsquo;respek&rsquo; what every street kid wants and might possibly expect at the point of a knife?

If the originalCall of Dutyleft you wanting more, this sequel will more than satisfy your hunger.Fight off waves of invading German troops and Panzer tanks in Moscow.View larger.Race around in your own tank with others at your side in North Africa.View larger.Scale the cliffs of Pointe du Hoc with the Army Rangers.View larger.Just as in the original,Call of Duty 2has you working your way through WWII across three interwoven campaigns. As a private in the Russian army, you will fight off waves of invading German troops and Panzer tanks in Moscow and Stalingrad. Once you finish the Russian campaign, you'll go up against Field Marshal Rommel's troops in the deserts of North Africa. As part of this campaign, you'll race around in your own tank with others at your side, and later you'll be tasked with calling in air strikes against enemy tanks. The final campaign has you in the role of an American corporal in Europe, but unlike most WWII games, you won't perform a D-Day landing on Omaha or Utah Beach. InCall of Duty 2, you have to scale the cliffs of Pointe du Hoc with the Army Rangers amidst a hail of artillery and machine gun fire, giving you a true appreciation of the time-honored saying, \"War is Hell!\"Call of Duty 2is a thinking-gamer's first-person shooter of medium difficulty. While there are many reflexive elements, the game quite often requires you to consider the tactics of the situation in order to survive. While you can probably blow through the game in 10 hours on the regular setting, the more difficult settings require you to be much more thoughtful about your approach to the different scenarios. Your teammates in battle neither finish your fight, nor simply provide enemy fodder, while the enemy AI (artificial intelligence) is quite clever. If you are too meek, you will find yourself pinned down by aggressive fire while the enemy lobs grenades at you until you're decimated.Unlike the its predecessor,Call of Duty 2doesn't give you a health bar. Instead, as you are hit by more and more fire, your screen grows increasingly red around the border, and your character begins to grunt and pant. This is your signal that it's time to find some cover in order to recuperate before you continue. Another major improvement is the enhanced smoke grenades, which not only look great but can be used effectively in battle to obscure your path from tanks or machine-gun nests as you make your way to an objective.WhileCall of Duty 2has received an ESRB T (teen) rating -- meaning there are no gratuitous blood and guts splashing all over the screen -- this is still war, and there are enemies that will try to drag themselves to safety after being hit, only to be bludgeoned to a screaming death by your fellow men-at-arms. And like its older brother,Call of Duty 2offers the standard deathmatch, team deathmatch, capture-the-flag, and search-and-destroy multiplayer modes. However, this version offers a new option called \"headquarters,\" which most closely resembles the \"crazy king\" version of king-of-the-hill in Halo 2. Shifting headquarter points appear and must be captured in order to start building points, only to be overrun by the other side in order to halt that point gain. This version of the multiplayer mode is not only extremely fun, but it requires teams to adapt on the fly.Unlike the original, in this sequel you can skip forward from one mission to the next once you've cleared a campaign. The game also auto-detects 16:9 and 16:10 wide-screen ratios, as well as the sometimes tricky 5:4 ratio for LCD monitors. As the user, you can make use of a good set of performance tweaking functions, or you can allow the game to determine the optimal ratio, based on your system. With the addition of actual war footage as introductions to each campaign, and famous war quotes at the end of the scenes,Call of Duty 2has everything you need to lose yourself in the middle of the biggest war in history of the world.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

        "B0002TB4CW": "Early Adopters Pick: March 2003. As the  world's smallest video-game platform, the Game Boy Advance SP is also the first to use a built-in rechargeable battery.Many decried the original Game Boy Advance's reflective LCD screen and its reliance on external light sources. The Game Boy Advance SP's main feature--optional backlighting--fixes this complaint nicely, but it's the wealth of other features that makes this system so surprisingly good.At first look, you might think the SP is a sleek travel alarm clock. When closed, it's just as tall and deep as the original GBA, but only half as wide. Due to its clamshell design, the screen is always protected from everyday scratches. A small button in the center of the console turns on the backlighting element for use in low-light situations, like in a moving car.The SP comes with a well-designed power adapter that recharges a built-in battery; its prongs fold in for easier storage. Our informal tests found that it takes about four hours to fully charge (you can even play it while it's plugged in and charging), and the battery lasts about 11 hours with the backlighting constantly on--your results may vary. Using the backlighting less often will conserve battery power.With  separately sold  cables, you can connect the Game Boy Advance SP to other GBAs  for multiplayer gaming (above) or to the  Nintendo GameCube  (below) to access secret levels, exchange data, or use other special  features that vary from game to game.The quality of the backlighting is very good. It's bright and clear when looking directly at it, but degraded from other angles. This is only a problem for friends who are watching the screen from over your shoulder.But size, power, and affordability do not come without trade offs. There's no headphone jack here, though Nintendo promises an adapter. The system isn't very loud at its highest volume, and the sound can be turned down to socially acceptable levels. The L and R shoulder buttons are a fraction of the size they were on the GBA, and thus are harder to hit. Also, the reduced size of the SP is slightly less comfortable for adult hands than the GBA, but perhaps more comfortable for smaller hands. The cartridge port placement on the lower part of the console is fine for GBA games, since they are flush with the console body, but older Game Boy Color carts will stick out in a way that takes some getting used to.Open it up and the hinge will seek out a preferred, pre-set angle (about 150 degrees), though you can open it a bit wider or narrower for your own comfort.

        "0091883768": "Change can be a blessing or a curse, depending on your perspective. The message ofWho Moved My Cheese?is that all can come to see it as a blessing, if they understand the nature of cheese and the role it plays in their lives.Who Moved My Cheese?is a parable that takes place in a maze. Four beings live in that maze: Sniff and Scurry are mice--nonanalytical and nonjudgmental, they just want cheese and are willing to do whatever it takes to get it. Hem and Haw are \"littlepeople,\" mouse-size humans who have an entirely different relationship with cheese. It's not just sustenance to them; it's their self-image. Their lives and belief systems are built around the cheese they've found. Most of us reading the story will see the cheese as something related to our livelihoods--our jobs, our career paths, the industries we work in--although it can stand for anything, from health to relationships. The point of the story is that we have to be alert to changes in the cheese, and be prepared to go running off in search of new sources of cheese when the cheese we have runs out.Dr.&nbsp;Johnson, coauthor ofThe One Minute Managerand many other books, presents this parable to business, church groups, schools, military organizations--anyplace where you find people who may fear or resist change. And although more analytical and skeptical readers may find the tale a little too simplistic, its beauty is that it sums up all natural history in just 94 pages: Things change. They always have changed and always will change. And while there's no single way to deal with change, the consequence of pretending change won't happen is always the same: The cheese runs out.--Lou Schuler--This text refers to an alternateHardcoveredition.",
        "0060889659": "Dan Ariely onSurvival of the SickestMIT professor Dan Ariely has become one of the leaders in the growing field of behavioral economics, and his bestselling book debut,Predictably Irrational, has brought his ideas--and his ingenious experiments and charming sense of humor--to a much wider audience. With the simplest of tests (often an auction or a quiz given under a few conditions) he shows again and again not only that we are wired to make irrational decisions in many situations, but that we do so in remarkably predictable ways.I have always been puzzled by the way in which genetic diseases have managed to survive throughout the ages. How could it be that these diseases were able to withstand the evolutionary process, where only the most fit survive, and continue to be transferred from one generation to the next?Survival of the Sickestprovides a thought provoking yet entertaining explanation to this puzzle.In this insightful book Dr. Sharon Moalem demonstrates how conditions that are considered unhealthy (such as hemochromatosis, diabetes, and high cholesterol), or even deadly in extreme cases, might actually put their carriers at an advantage in combating other life-threatening illnesses. For example, he explains that hemochromatosis, a disease that, if left untreated, will kill you, may have actually been a defense against the deadliest pandemic in history--the bubonic plague during the 14th century. It turns out that this genetic mutation, which continues to be passed down through generations, actually helped spare many lives at one point.Throughout the book, Dr. Moalem draws many connections between seemingly disparate subjects, such as the accidental invention of ice wine and cold diuresis, in order to illustrate the basic mechanisms of genetics and medicine in charming and intuitive ways. He skillfully interweaves his knowledge of history, genetics, and medicine not only as they relate to specific medical conditions but also in a way that addresses important challenges of modern society and our future evolution.In the most general terms, Dr. Moalem's description of the human body and its complexity left me in awe of how far we have come in our understanding of biology and medicine, while also being reminded that the road to understanding ourselves is still wide open with much more to learn in the decades, and even centuries, to come. It is a fantastic journey on which he leads us and Dr. Moalem is a kind, knowledgeable, humorous, and helpful guide.",

This time the lord of legal thrillers dives deep into the world of the homeless, particularly their barely audible legal voice in a world dominated by large, all-powerful law firms. Our hero, Michael Brock, is on the fast track to partnership at D.C.'s premier law firm, Sweeny & Drake. His dream of someday raking in a million-plus a year is finally within reach. Nothing can stop him, not even 90-hour workweeks and a failing marriage--until he meets DeVon Hardy, a.k.a.  &quot;Mister,&quot; a Vietnam vet with a grudge against his landlord--and a few lawyers to fry. Hardy, with no clear motive, takes Brock and eight of his colleagues hostage in a boardroom, demanding their tax returns and interrogating them with a conviction that would have put perpetrators of the Spanish Inquisition to shame. Hardy, a man of few words and a lot of ammunition, mumbles cryptically, &quot;Who are the evictors?&quot; as he points a .44 automatic within inches of Brock's face. The violent outcome of the hostage situation triggers an abrupt soul-searching for the young lawyer, and Hardy's mysterious question continues to haunt him. Brock learns that Hardy had been in and out of homeless shelters most of his life, but he had recently begun paying rent in a rundown building; that means he has legal recourse when a big money-making outfit such as Sweeny & Drake boots him with no warning. When Brock realizes that his profession caters to the morally challenged, he sets out on an aimless search through the dicier side of D.C., ending up at the 14th Street Legal Clinic. The clinic's director, a gargantuan man named Mordecai Green, woos Brock to the clinic with a $90,000 cut in pay and the chance to redeem his soul. Brock takes it--and some of the story's credibility along with it; it's hard to believe that a Yale graduate who sacrificed everything--including his marriage--to succeed in the legal profession would quickly jump at the opportunity for low-paying, charitable work. However, Brock's search for corruption in the swanky upper echelons of Sweeny & Drake (via the toughest streets of D.C.) is filled with colorful characters and realistic, gritty descriptions. In theThe Street Lawyer, Grisham once again defends the voiceless and powerless. In the words of Mordecai Green, &quot;That's justice, Michael. That's what street law is all about.

Tiberium, the mysterious, alien crystalline structure that infested Earth for decades and caused years of relentless conflict between the Global Defense Initiative and the Brotherhood of Nod, was close to rendering the planet uninhabitable. In the midst of this crisis, Kane, Nod's prophetic leader, emerged from seclusion to deliver GDI the message that he had developed a system that could control Tiberium and harness its power. But he could not build this \"Tiberium Control Network\" without GDI's cooperation. Thus, the two opposing factions&mdash;GDI and Nod&mdash;found themselves in a desperate and unlikely alliance to stop Tiberium from extinguishing mankind.Now, after 15 years, the network is nearly complete. Tiberium is under strict control and the revitalized Earth is on the cusp of a new age of prosperity and progress. It is only now that the world's citizens begin to seriously ponder why Kane chose to help, and what he will want in return. Kane. GDI. Nod. Tiberium. How will it end? These questions and more lead to the dramatic final act of the 15-year Tiberium saga inCommand &amp; Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight.GameplayCommand &amp; Conqueris a real-time strategy gaming franchise, andCommand &amp; Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilightis no exception. Players assume color-coated versions of the GDI or Nod factions and uncover segments of the map, where they must manage Tiberium and other resources in their possession or that they they mine or commandeer in the field. Other factions occur in the game, but are not playable, and different single player campaigns are available to players depending on which of the two factions are chosen. The energy that Tiberium crystals possess is used in the manufacture and upgrading of mining and combat units, weapons and support infrastructure in preparation for impending conflicts with other players on the same map that are doing the same. Each faction has its own distinct unit types, both land and air based, which although unique, are overall more or less balanced against those of opposing faction. In addition, certain units can be captured on the battlefield and used to supplement your arsenal. The overarching task though is to combine the right number and type of units with the right battlefield strategy for the conflict and terrain at hand.Historically,C&amp;Cmatches have been won by completely eliminating all enemy units that stand against you. Although there is certainly plenty of this withinTiberian Twilight, the game also is different in that players need not eliminate all enemy units, instead capturing control nodes throughout the game and holding them for a minimum amount of time. Doing so leads to earning enough points to win the match.Tiberian Twilightalso differs from earlier games in the series with the addition of certain RPG game elements. Players overall orientation within their chosen faction is class based, with units falling generally in offensive, defensive or support classes depending on your play style. These units can be upgraded with experience points, which are gained through success against enemy units, with more advanced enemy units earning the conquering player more points, and thus potential unit upgrade opportunity.5-on-5 Online MultiplayerCommand &amp; Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilightallows PC gamers to team up and battle like never before.

At the same time, a woman in Pine Cove hangs herself; the local psychiatrist (who has been prescribing antidepressants to everyone in town with gay abandon) decides the suicide was her fault and yanks everyone's medication; and an elderly black blues singer named Catfish Jefferson arrives to perform at the Head of the Slug saloon.

Though the pace sometimes slows to allow Mishkin, Crosetti and Bracegirdle to divulge interesting aspects of their personal lives, these digressions only make the story more engaging.

        "0060010800": "Neverwhere's protagonist, Richard Mayhew, learns the hard way  that no good deed goes unpunished. He ceases to exist in the ordinary world of London Above, and joins a quest through the dark and dangerous London Below, a shadow city of lost and forgotten people, places, and times. His companions are Door, who is trying to find out who hired the assassins who murdered her family and why; the Marquis of Carabas, a trickster who trades services for very big favors; and Hunter, a mysterious lady who guards bodies and hunts only the biggest game. London Below is a wonderfully realized shadow world, and the story plunges through it like an express passing local stations, with plenty of action and a satisfying conclusion. The story is reminiscent of Douglas Adams'sThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, but Neil Gaiman's humor is much darker and his images sometimes truly horrific. Puns and allusions to everything fromParadise LosttoThe Wonderful Wizard of Ozabound, but you can enjoy the book without getting all of them.

        "0064408639": "As the three Baudelaire orphans warily approach their new home--Prufrock  Preparatory School--they can't help but notice the enormous stone arch bearing  the school's mottoMemento Mori, or \"Remember you will die.\" This is not  a cheerful greeting, and certainly marks an inauspicious beginning to a very  bleak story. Of course, this is what we have come to expect from Lemony  Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events, the deliciously morbid set of books that  began withThe Bad  Beginningand only got worse.InThe Austere Academy, Violet, Klaus, and Sunny are at first  optimistic--attending school is a welcome change for the book-loving trio, and  the academy is allegedly safe from the dreaded Count Olaf, who is after their  fortune. Hope dissipates quickly, however, when they meet Vice Principal Nero, a  self-professed genius violinist who sneeringly imitates their every word. More  dreadful still, he houses them in the tin Orphans Shack, crawling with  toe-biting crabs and dripping with a mysterious tan fungus. A beam of light  shines through the despair when the Baudelaires meet the Quagmires, two of three  orphaned triplets who are no strangers to disaster and sympathize with their  predicament. When Count Olaf appears on the scene disguised as Coach Genghis  (covering his monobrow with a turban and his ankle tattoo with expensive running  shoes), the Quagmires resolve to come to the aid of their new friends. Sadly,  this proves to be a hideous mistake.Snicket disarms us again with his playful juxtapositions--only he can compare  bombs with strawberry shortcake (both are as dangerous to make as assumptions),  muse on how babies adjust developmentally to the idea of curtains, or ponder why  the Baudelaire orphans would not want to be stalks of celery despite their  incessant bad luck as humans. We can't get enough of this splendid series of  misadventures, and can only wager that swarms of young readers will be right  next to us in line for the next installment.

In between, he recounts such wonders as an entire town struck  with insomnia, a woman who ascends to heaven while hanging laundry, and a suicide that defies the laws of physics:A trickle of blood came out under the door, crossed the living room,  went out into the street, continued on in a straight line across the uneven terraces, went down steps and climbed over curbs, passed along the  Street of the Turks, turned a corner to the right and another to the left,  made a right angle at the Buend&iacute;a house, went in under the closed door,  crossed through the parlor, hugging the walls so as not to stain the rugs, went  on to the other living room, made a wide curve to avoid the dining-room  table, went along the porch with the begonias, and passed without being seen  under Amaranta's chair as she gave an arithmetic lesson to Aureliano  Jos&eacute;, and went through the pantry and came out in the kitchen, where  &Uacute;rsula was getting ready to crack thirty-six eggs to make bread.\"Holy Mother of God!\" &Uacute;rsula shouted.The story follows 100 years in the life of Macondo, a village founded  by Jos&eacute; Arcadio Buend&iacute;a and occupied by descendants all  sporting variations on their progenitor's name: his sons, Jos&eacute; Arcadio and Aureliano,  and grandsons, Aureliano Jos&eacute;, Aureliano Segundo, and Jos&eacute;  Arcadio Segundo. Then there are the women--the two &Uacute;rsulas, a handful of  Remedios, Fernanda, and Pilar--who struggle to remain grounded even as their menfolk build castles in the air.  If it is possible for a novel to be highly comic  and deeply tragic at the same time, thenOne Hundred Years of  Solitudedoes the trick. Civil war rages throughout, hearts break, dreams  shatter, and lives are lost, yet the effect is literary pentimento, with  sorrow's outlines bleeding through the vibrant colors of Garc&#xED;a M&aacute;rquez's  magical realism. Consider, for example, the ghost of Prudencio Aguilar, whom  Jos&eacute; Arcadio Buend&iacute;a has killed in a fight.

Amid the chaos, Eph Goodweather&mdash;head of the Center for Disease Control&rsquo;s team&mdash;leads a small band out to stop these bloodthirsty monsters. But it may be too late.Ignited by the Master&rsquo;s horrific plan, a war erupts between Old and New World vampires, each vying for total control. Caught between these warring forces, humans&mdash;powerless and vulnerable&mdash;are no longer the consumers, but the consumed.Though Eph understands the vampiric plague better than anyone, even he cannot protect those he loves from the invading evil. His ex-wife, Kelly, has been turned by the Master, and now she stalks the city, in the darkness, looking for her chance to reclaim Zack, Eph&rsquo;s young son.With the future of the world in the balance, Eph and his courageous team, guided by the brilliant former professor and Holocaust survivor Abraham Setrakian and exterminator Vasiliy Fet, must combat a terror whose ultimate plan is more terrible than anyone first imagined&mdash;a fate worse than annihilation.A Q&amp;A with Academy Award&reg;-winner Guillermo Del ToroQ:You&rsquo;ve written screenplays and directed numerous movies, to name a few of your many accomplishments. What motivated you to write a novel?Del Toro:Well, it&rsquo;s a different challenge, but I've always written short stories and then, in my film work, storylines for movies (the storyline is a slightly \"freer\" form than screenplay writing) I have published some of my short stories in the past and it is my secret dream to write shivery tales for young readers. My favorite author in that sense isRoald Dahlwho mixed it free-style between the grotesque and the magical. I love the short story form as a reader but if a novel has a terse structure I find it far more immersive and fulfilling. Nevertheless some of my favorite authors, Borges,Quiroga,Saki, etc. are masters of the short story form. The novel grew out of appetite and scope.Q:You are one of the most extraordinarily imaginative and creative thinkers working in the arts today. What were some of the influences that have contributed to your success? Do you have any kind of a muse?Del Toro:Curiously enough I regularly draw more inspiration from painters and books than I do from other films.  Painters like Carlos Schwabe, Odilon Redon, Fliecien Rops, Bocklin, Freud, Bacon, Thomas Cole and many others, never fail to excite me and in the book front there are just as many authors...Dickens, does the trick every time as doesWilde,Rulfo,Quiroga, etc.Q:Many of your movies have centered on fantastical characters. Why did you choose to write your first novel about vampires?Del Toro:All of my life I&rsquo;ve been fascinated by them but always from a Naturalist's point of view.Cronos, my first movie, wanted to be a rephrasing of the genre&mdash;I love the rephrasing of an old myth.  When I tackledBlade II, I approached it with a myriad of ideas about Vampire Biology but only a few of those made it into the film. Tonally, the movie needed to be an action film and some of the biological stuff was too disturbing already...  I love the idea of the biological, the divine and the evolutionary angles to explain the origin and function of the Vampire genus. Some of my favorite books about Vampirism are treatises on Vampiric \"fact&rdquo;--books by Bernard J Hurwood,Augustin Camet, andMontague Summers.Q:There are many stories, movies, and even a television show involving vampires. The Strain Trilogy uses the idea that vampires are a plague, and that the lead hunter is a scientist from the Centers for Disease Control. What was your inspiration for this twist?Del Toro:When I was a kid I lovedThe Night Stalkerand I fell in love with the idea Matheson and Rice posited, of exploring a creature of such powerful stature through the point of view of a common worker, a man used to deal with things in a procedural way. \"Just another day at the job...\".Q:How did you and Chuck Hogan come together to write The Strain Trilogy? How does your collaboration work?Del Toro:It was a true collaboration. I had created a \"bible\" for the book. It contained most of the structural ideas and characters and Chuck then took his pass on it and invented new characters and ideas. Fet (one of my favorite characters) was completely invented by him. And then I did my pass, writing new chapters or heavily editing his pass, and then he did a pass on my pass and so on and so forth. This is the way I have co-written in the past.  I loved Chuck's style and ideas from reading his books and I specifically wanted him as a partner because he had a strong sense of reality and had NEVER written a horror book. I knew we would complete each other in the creation of this book. What surprised me is that he came up with some gruesome moments all on his own! He revealed himself to be a rather disturbed man!A Q&amp;A with Hammett Award-winner Chuck HoganQ:What most surprised you about working with Guillermo Del Toro? Has working with him impacted your own work? In your former career as a video store clerk, did you ever in your wildest dreams imagine working on a project like this&mdash;with a legend like Del Toro?Hogan:I'd never co-authored anything, nor had I published a true work of horror before, and here I was embarking on an epic trilogy with a master of the genre.  I probably should have been more intimidated--yet I felt an immediate kinship with the material, as well as true excitement at the challenge of bringing the story to life, both of which carried me through.   Guillermo is a daunting first audience, and yet an incredibly generous collaborator.  Not to mention an amazing resource:  it's just fun to have to ask him a question&mdash;say, about why the vampires run hot instead of cold&mdash;know that, not only will he take me through their intricate biology, but he will embroider the account with corroborating examples from the field of entomology, marine life, and some arcane fact about the function of human blood platelets.Q:The Town,Devils in Exile, andThe Killing Moon, probe the dark side of human nature. What draws you to this theme, and to the genre of suspense?Hogan:Crime and horror are both genres of existentialism, and I am drawn to stories of man at his extremes, of people who find themselves tested, haunted, threatened.  I believe a writer should challenge himself in his work just as he challenges the characters in his story&mdash;that anything less would be inauthentic and dishonest.  What I love aboutThe Strainis that the journey of the story takes this maxim and multiplies it by one thousand.",

Michael keeps Patrick from freaking out by keeping score after each attack and relating his instructions from the Game Master each morning. Maintaining this facade becomes more difficult, however, as they meet other survivors and become involved with the mercurial Captain Jopek. Though the story is told in the third person, Michael's thoughts are in a distinctive, stream-of-consciousness voice that takes some getting used to but effectively brings readers deep inside the character's head. This freewheeling style, combined with Patrick's fondness for butt jokes, might appeal to younger readers, but the story is not all zombie fun and games; it is brutal bordering on horrific, and it packs an emotional wallop, particularly when it comes to Michael's determination to protect his sibling.-Eliza Langhans, Hatfield Public Library, MA&#x3B1;(c) Copyright 2013.

All do, however, have motives for murder: the smarmy fellow has personally humiliated successful Felicia Redmon, professionally backstabbed not-so-successful Tallie Blankenship and plagiarized the plot of a book that means the world to ambitious Jan Glass. So confessing that they were the last to see their tormentor alive is likely to make them prime suspects, even in the eyes of Tallie's protective new cop boyfriend. But if they stay silent, they may wind up being the real murderer's next victims. While whodunit isn't revealed till the book's surprise ending, the suspense isn't the kind that kills you. As is typical of Bond's books (Party Crashers,etc.), the overall tone is deliciously frothy, and small comedic details abound: high-powered Felicia is a secret super housewife who cleans, cooks and lies about it, and Jan has changed her name from plain \"Jane\" to appear more glamorously French. And though romance is not the book's main focus, there's enough love between the laughs to keep relationship-minded readers happy.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0060931418": "At the height of the Harlem Renaissance during the 1930s, Zora Neale Hurston was the preeminent black woman writer in the United States. She was a sometime-collaborator withLangston Hughesand a fierce rival ofRichard Wright. Her stories appeared in major magazines, she consulted on Hollywood screenplays, and she penned four novels, an autobiography, countless essays, and two books on black mythology. Yet by the late 1950s, Hurston was living in obscurity, working as a maid in a Florida hotel. She died in 1960 in a Welfare home, was buried in an unmarked grave, and quickly faded from literary consciousness until 1975 whenAlice Walkeralmost single-handedly revived interest in her work.Of Hurston's fiction,Their Eyes Were Watching Godis arguably the best-known and perhaps the most controversial. The novel follows the fortunes of Janie Crawford, a woman living in the black town of Eaton, Florida. Hurston sets up her characters and her locale in the first chapter, which, along with the last, acts as a framing device for the story of Janie's life. Unlike Wright andRalph Ellison, Hurston does not write explicitly about black people in the context of a white world--a fact that earned her scathing criticism from the social realists--but she doesn't ignore the impact of black-white relations either:It was the time for sitting on porches beside the road. It was the time to hear things and talk. These sitters had been tongueless, earless, eyeless conveniences all day long. Mules and other brutes had occupied their skins. But now, the sun and the bossman were gone, so the skins felt powerful and human. They became lords of sounds and lesser things. They passed nations through their mouths. They sat in judgment.One person the citizens of Eaton are inclined to judge is Janie Crawford, who has married three men and been tried for the murder of one of them. Janie feels no compulsion to justify herself to the town, but shedoesexplain herself to her friend, Phoeby, with the implicit understanding that Phoeby can \"tell 'em what Ah say if you wants to. Dat's just de same as me 'cause mah tongue is in mah friend's mouf.\"Hurston's use of dialect enraged other African American writers such as Wright, who accused her of pandering to white readers by giving them the black stereotypes they expected. Decades later, however, outrage has been replaced by admiration for her depictions of black life, and especially the lives of black women. InTheir Eyes Were Watching GodZora Neale Hurston breathes humanity into both her men and women, and allows them to speak in their own voices.--Alix Wilber",

But what distinguishes this book from a multitude of similar stories are Kleypas's characters. One can imagine the mouthy Lillian as a regular onSex and the Cityand, with his contemporary sensibilities and hunky good looks, Marcus could easily win the heart of a modern woman.

        "006079156X": "The Space Between Us, Thrity Umrigar's poignant novel about a wealthy woman and her downtrodden servant, offers a revealing look at class and gender roles in modern day Bombay. Alternatively told through the eyes of Sera, a Parsi widow whose pregnant daughter and son-in-law share her elegant home, and Bhima, the elderly housekeeper who must support her orphaned granddaughter, Umrigar does an admirable job of creating two sympathetic characters whose bond goes far deeper than that of employer and employee.When we first meet Bhima, she is sharing a thin mattress with Maya, the granddaughter upon whom high hopes and dreams were placed, only to be shattered by an unexpected pregnancy and its disastrous consequences. As time goes on, we learn that Sera and her family have used their power and money time and time again to influence the lives of Bhima and Maya, from caring for Bhima's estranged husband after a workplace accident, to providing the funds for Maya's college education. We also learn that Sera's seemingly privileged life is not as it appears; after enduring years of cruelty under her mother-in-law's roof, she faced physical and emotional abuse at the hands of her husband, pain that only Bhima could see and alleviate. Yet through the triumphs and tragedies, Sera and Bhima always shared a bond that transcended class and race; a bond shared by two women whose fate always seemed to rest in the hands of others, just outside their control.Told in a series of flashbacks and present day encounters,The Space Between Usgains strength from both plot and prose. A beautiful tale of tragedy and hope, Umrigar's second novel is sure to linger in readers' minds.--Gisele Toueg--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

        "0060957867": "Books by politicians are not often worth reading, but John McCain'sFaith of My Fathersis an astonishing exception to the rule. The Republican senator from Arizona has a remarkable story to tell--better than just about any of his peers--and he tells it well, with crisp prose and an unexpected sense for narrative pacing. The first half of the book concerns his naval forbears: his grandfather commanded an aircraft carrier in the Second World War, while his father presided over all naval forces in the Pacific during the Vietnam War. They were the first father-son admirals in American history. Young John McCain knew he had enormous shoes to fill and rebelled against many of the expectations set for him. At the Naval Academy, he was nearly expelled, graduating fifth from the bottom of his class. He never became an admiral, but achieved fame another way: as a naval aviator in 1967, he was shot down over North Vietnam and spent several years in POW camps, where he was beaten, tortured, and nearly allowed to die. McCain describes the awful details of his imprisonment and tells how he stayed mentally strong during seemingly endless months of solitary confinement and how he communicated in code with fellow captives.Faith of My Fathersconcludes with McCain's release and contains no information about his subsequent political career. It is, nonetheless, a complete and compelling memoir of individual heroism--one that will interest both political and military history buffs.--John J.

Fifteen years after Lisa goes missing, her younger brother, Sam, gets a strange phone call that leads him and his girlfriend, Phoebe, to discover a book, supposedly written by the King of the Fairies, that Lisa used as her bible to cross over, and which prompts Sam and Phoebe to meet up with Sam's cousin, Evie, to see if they can figure out what happened to Lisa.

So, when a distraught mother reports that her 16-year-old son didn&#x2019;t return from school, Avi assures her that the boy will turn up. But he doesn&#x2019;t, and Avi, a man filled with self-doubt and perhaps numbed by his town&#x2019;s lack of unusual crime, agonizes as the investigation lurches on.

Vampires from all over the globe have gathered around Lestat, who lies prostrate on the floor of a cathedral. Dead? In a coma? As Armand reflects on Lestat's condition, he is drawn by David Talbot to tell the story of his own life. The narrative abruptly rushes back to 15th-century Constantinople, and the Armand of the present recounts the fragmented memories of his childhood abduction from Kiev. Eventually, he is sold to a Venetian artist (and vampire), Marius. Rice revels in descriptions of the sensual relationship between the young and still-mortal Armand and his vampiric mentor. But when Armand is finally transformed, the tone of the book dramatically shifts. Raw and sexually explicit scenes are displaced by Armand's introspective quest for a union of his Russian Orthodox childhood, his hedonistic life with Marius, and his newly acquired immortality. These final chapters remind one of the archetypal significance of Rice's vampires; at their best, Armand, Lestat, and Marius offer keen insights into the most human of concerns.The Vampire Armandis richly intertextual; readers will relish the retelling of critical events from Lestat and Louis's narratives. Nevertheless, the novel is very much Armand's own tragic tale.

        "0061233781": "Amazon Best Books of the Month, October 2010: It's April 1865 and General Lee's troops have officially surrendered. Abraham Lincoln, looking forward to rebuilding the nation, celebrates with an evening&mdash;his last alive&mdash;at the theater. On the other side of the Mason-Dixon Line Jefferson Davis plans to move the Confederate government to North Carolina, away from Union troops that have captured Richmond. Under much different circumstances, both men embark on a dramatic final journey depicted by James. L. Swanson inBloody Crimes, a gripping account of the weeks following Lincoln&rsquo;s death and the end of the Civil War. While arguments erupted about where and how Lincoln&rsquo;s burial should take place, Jefferson Davis&mdash;refusing to let the South succumb&mdash;attempted to rally his people despite being hunted by Northern troops who suspected his involvement in Lincoln&rsquo;s assassination. Using relics and key documents of the day, Swanson juxtaposes the travels of Davis and Lincoln, weaving a fast-paced narrative that lures readers in from the get-go. We know that eventually Lincoln makes it to his final resting place and Davis is captured, but along the way it&rsquo;s hard not to wonder if these two heroic leaders were more similar than perhaps anyone would have guessed. Whether read as a companion toManhunt&mdash;Swanson&rsquo;s account of the 12-day search for John Wilkes Booth&mdash;or on its own,Bloody Crimesis the next great Civil War-era read worthy of the recognition that Lincoln once said we should all strive for.  --Jessica ScheinAmazon Exclusive: James L. Swanson on WritingBloody CrimesI wroteBloody Crimesas a way of answering a question manyManhuntreaders asked:  &ldquo;What happened next?&rdquo;  InManhuntI told just one of the three incredible stories that unfolded at the climax of the Civil War.  I could only hint at the strange and amazing things that happened to Lincoln&rsquo;s body after he died, and I could do no more than allude to Jefferson Davis&rsquo;s dramatic flight from Richmond and his six week odyssey to save the Confederacy. So it would be correct to say thatBloody Crimesis a sequel toManhunt.Since I was a child, I&rsquo;ve been fascinated by the Lincoln funeral train, and I debated whether to write a book about that story alone.  It is hard for a modern reader to comprehend how much Lincoln&rsquo;s death, the White House funeral, the Pennsylvania Avenue procession, and the president&rsquo;s sojourn home to Illinois influenced America.  Imagine the death of President Kennedy and intensify by several degrees the emotions it released.  As I researched the Lincoln funeral pageant, I began thinking about another president on his great journey.  As I studied Davis, I realized that he is one of the &ldquo;Lost Men&rdquo; of American history.  Today we know so little about him.  To my great surprise, he and Lincoln had much in common.  Some of their shared experiences were stunning, even profound.  And in April 1865, both presidents left their White Houses, took to the field, and sought to rally their armies at the climax of the war.Combining the final journeys of Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis into one book presented several challenges.  I needed to return to the assassination, but I did not want to repeat material fromManhunt. I solved that problem by, like a film director, shifting the camera and pointing it in a different direction.  InManhunt, my camera captured every moment of action inside Ford&rsquo;s Theatre. InBloody Crimes, that camera never sets foot inside Ford&rsquo;s, but instead takes position inside the Petersen House, capturing the assassination through fresh eyes, those of the boarders who lived there and the visitors who descended upon it.  InManhunt, once Lincoln was dead, he ceased to be a principal character in the book.  InBloody Crimes, though Lincoln is dead, he remains a vital character until the end.  One of the pleasures of writing the book was meeting the splendid cast of characters who played significant roles in the death pageant, including the larger-than-life Commissioner of Public Buildings in Washington, D.C., Benjamin Brown French, who kept an amazing diary.Another great pleasure was experiencing the final journey of Jefferson Davis through the firsthand accounts of his inner circle, cabinet members, young female loyalists, and his family, especially Davis&rsquo;s wife Varina.  The love letters they exchanged during his darkest days go unread today, but they are as moving as the correspondence of John and Abigail Adams.I cannot write a book without holding in my hand the original sources&mdash;Civil War newspapers, documents, photos, and artifacts&mdash;and I must visit the sites where history happened.  Through these objects and places, I travel back in time and, I hope, take my readers with me.  Many of the places I visited while writingBloody Crimesstill haunt me: The Confederate White House, where toys still lie upon the floor, as if the Davis children will return momentarily to continue their play;  the East Room of Lincoln&rsquo;s White House, site of his majestic funeral;  the cemetery vault in Georgetown, where Abraham Lincoln&rsquo;s dead son Willie waited for his father to claim him and bring him home to Illinois;  and the graves of Jefferson Davis and his family at Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond.  Indeed, shortly before the publication ofBloody Crimes, I visited the grave of Jefferson Davis.  A powerful storm had twisted and torn from the ground a mighty oak tree that had, for the past century, offered shade to Davis&rsquo;s grave and bronze statue.  Had the massive tree fallen in a slightly different direction, it would have smashed the gravestone and toppled Jefferson Davis from his pedestal.The final journeys of Lincoln and Davis, each a martyr to his cause, tell the stories of two men, two peoples, and two nations during the most thrilling days in American history.  Their dual stories form an American epic, a kind of AmericanIliad, that made our history, and that continues to influence it to this day.",

Beaumont and Cochise County, Ariz., sheriff Joanna Brady, for a gripping tale that's easily one of her best. While their first dual outing, 2002'sPartner in Crime, stagnated with clich&eacute;d professional and sexual tension, this time the combination excels with a focus on parallel investigations that naturally&mdash;and chillingly&mdash;intersect. In Seattle, Beaumont looks into the burned bodies of six unidentified women. In Arizona, Brady handles the murder of an ATV park caretaker. Beaumont and Brady pool their information when a murdered woman links back to the missing sister of Jaime Carbajal, one of Brady's detectives. While Brady stays in Arizona, Carbajal's arrival in Washington sets off a chain of events with fatal consequences.

While convalescing in England, Bess is tormented because she's put off delivering a message from Arthur Graham, a dying soldier under her care for whom she'd developed strong feelings, to his family. Her own brush with death prompts her to travel to Kent and transmit Arthur's cryptic last words to one of his three brothers. Bess becomes further enmeshed in the family's affairs after she learns the obscure message may relate to Graham's half-brother, Peregrine, who was committed to a local asylum for a girl's murder years before.

A major franchise in the RPG genre, MegaTen games take place in the contemporary or near-future Japan, mixing occult and cyberpunk elements. The games feature mythological references from multiple mythologies, and the player is often asked to make moral or philosophical choices that affect the game's storyline and ending.The silent male protagonist who represents the player in Persona 4 attends Yasogami High School with Chie, Yosuke, and Yukiko. His entire personality and name is decided and portrayed by the player's in-game actions and decisions. He wields two-handed sword type weapons, but unlike Persona 3, he doesn't use alternative weapons.Mysterious Murders AboundPersona 4 takes place in a rural town named Inaba where mysterious murders occur whenever there is fog after heavy rain. The town has a television channel that airs only at midnight called Mayonaka TV, during which it is said that one can see their \"other half\" while staring at the screen. After hearing about a recent unsolved murder, some characters realize that they had witnessed the murder victim while watching Mayonaka TV.The protagonist discovers that during midnight when the channel is on, his body can phase into his television set, using the set as a gateway to another world infested with shadows. Mayonaka TV and the town murders seem so connected that it's possible that the victims may in fact victims of Mayonaka TV itself. The characters decide to solve the mysterious murders by exploring the hidden world of Mayonaka TV.Brand-New Yet Familiar game playPersona 4's game play and style are similar to the popular Persona 3. Players familiar with Persona 3 will quickly recognize the social links and dungeon crawling game play, as well as the engine itself. The battles also have some similarities, such as the One More system, All-out attack, and the AI controlled support characters.However, unlike Persona 3, characters can be set to take commands from the player, new glasses allow characters to see through the heavy mist inside Mayonaka TV, and tarot cards can be shattered to summon the characters' respective Persona. Other changes include an increase in player stats from three to five, and the removal of health status, allowing players to explore dungeons continuously.Let the Action BeginBattle-wise, Persona 4 lets you directly control the actions of other party members and continually exploit an enemy's weakness. Post-battle card shuffles have added Arcana Chance, which bring you good or bad status depending on the Arcana. Battles now occur after school instead of at midnight, like in Persona 3, giving the player less time in which to do social activities. This turns out to be significant because Social Links now have a greater effect on battle.At higher levels, the player's allies progress from occasionally protecting the protagonist from a deathblow, through occasionally offering follow-up attacks, to eventually allow the persona of the corresponding ally to evolve into another persona. And persona can retain or even lose weaknesses and can be immune to certain kind of magic attacks. All allies who have their corresponding Social Link levels maxed out now have a chance to survive an otherwise fatal attack, leaving them with one remaining HP.",

In 1951, when Ronan O'Mara is nine, he meets the aging itinerant Storyteller, who emerges out a \"silver veil\" of Irish mist, hoping to trade a yarn for a hot meal. Welcomed inside, the Storyteller lights his pipe and begins, telling of the architect of Newgrange, who built \"a marvelous, immortal structure... before Stonehenge in England, before the pyramids of Egypt,\" and the dentally challenged King Conor of Ulster, who tried, and failed, to outsmart his wife. The stories utterly captivate the young Ronan (\"This is the best thing that ever, ever happened\"), and they'll draw readers in, too, with their warriors and kings, drinkers and devils, all rendered cleanly and without undue sentimentality. When Ronan's mother banishes the Storyteller for telling a blasphemous tale, Ronan vows to find him. He also becomes fascinated by Irish myth and legend, and, as the years pass, he discovers his own gift for storytelling. Eventually, he sets off, traversing Ireland on foot to find his mentor.

In fact, the ability to focus, more than IQ or social background, is the key to performance and success. Neuroscience, case studies, and personal experience contribute to Goleman&#x2019;s exploration of focus, which includes concentration, selective attention, open awareness, self-awareness, empathy, and systems awareness. He breaks them down to inner, other, and outer focus. Among examples of the significance of focus: a doctor&#x2019;s ability to shut down emotions to focus on gory medical procedures; an epidemiologist&#x2019;s attention to patterns and systems to track the human connections that lead to global pandemics; and a gamer&#x2019;s focus on spatial perception, decision making, and ability to track objects. In commerce, education, sports, and personal life, Goleman offers concepts and techniques, including mindfulness and meditation, to train ourselves to be more focused, exercising those areas of the brain involved in focusing attention.

        "0006551807": "Any talk ofThe Namesake--Jhumpa Lahiri's follow-up to her Pulitzer Prize-winning debut,Interpreter of Maladies--must begin with a name: Gogol Ganguli. Born to an Indian academic and his wife, Gogol is afflicted from birth with a name that is neither Indian nor American nor even really a first name at all. He is given the name by his father who, before he came to America to study at MIT, was almost killed in a train wreck in India. Rescuers caught sight of the volume of Nikolai Gogol's short stories that he held, and hauled him from the train. Ashoke gives his American-born son the name as a kind of placeholder, and the awkward thing sticks.Awkwardness is Gogol's birthright. He grows up a bright American boy, goes to Yale, has pretty girlfriends, becomes a successful architect, but like many second-generation immigrants, he can never quite find his place in the world. There's a lovely section where he dates a wealthy, cultured young Manhattan woman who lives with her charming parents. They fold Gogol into their easy, elegant life, but even here he can find no peace and he breaks off the relationship.  His mother finally sets him up on a blind date with the daughter of a Bengali friend, and Gogol thinks he has found his match. Moushumi, like Gogol, is at odds with the Indian-American world she inhabits. She has found, however, a circuitous escape: \"At Brown, her rebellion had been academic ... she'd pursued a double major in French. Immersing herself in a third language, a third culture, had been her refuge--she approached French, unlike things American or Indian, without guilt, or misgiving, or expectation of any kind.\" Lahiri documents these quiet rebellions and random longings with great sensitivity. There's no  cleverness or showing-off inThe Namesake, just beautifully confident storytelling. Gogol's story is neither comedy nor tragedy; it's simply that ordinary, hard-to-get-down-on-paper commodity: real life.--Claire Dederer--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

        "0062079603": "*Starred Review* The ratification of the U.S. Constitution in 1788 provided a common legal and political framework to bind 13 supposedly sovereign states to a stronger federal government. But the U.S. was still more of a theoretical nation than an actual one. The War of 1812 and the Mexican War engendered surges of nationalism, but it required a Civil War to administer the death blow to the most extreme forms of sectionalism. Winchester, the widely acclaimed author, is a native of Great Britain who recently became an American citizen. His focus here is on the more subtle aspects of nation building. He examines the accomplishments of a variety of characters, some famous and some obscure, whose visions and mastery of emerging technologies drew Americans closer together as our geographic size expanded. Thomas Jefferson&#x2019;s vision of an &#x201C;empire of liberty&#x201D; led to the acquisition of the Louisiana Territory and the Lewis and Clark expedition. William Maclure, a hyperactive Scottish immigrant, provided a geological survey of vast areas of the eastern U.S. and then promoted the value of a practical education for ordinary citizens. Winchester provides a fascinating portrayal of Samuel Morse, the &#x201C;man who tamed the lightning,&#x201D; and the vital role of the telegraph in bridging distances. This is a finely crafted and valuable reminder that the evolution of our united nation was a process often accelerated by unlikely, sometimes eccentric men who operated outside the political sphere.

Free markets are great, the 20/20 correspondent repeatedly tells readers, while government regulation stifles innovation and keeps consumers from gaining access to the best, safest products possible. Stossel calls out the federal government in particular, citing its \"incompetence\" and comparing the FDA to a \"malignant tumor\" (he also claims September 11 happened because \"the FAA never asked for tighter security\"). While Stossel describes himself as a libertarian, his comments on the liberal media establishment are reminiscent of those of outspoken conservative Bernard Goldberg. Many readers who nod in agreement when Stossel complains about the \"totalitarian left,\" however, may find it harder to share his enthusiasm for extending personal liberty to include assisted suicide, legalized prostitution and dwarf-tossing. Stossel may be effective in small doses on 20/20, but his rhetorical strength diminishes when the print format requires him to go on at length. 16-page b&amp;w photo insert not seen by PW.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "B000VJRU44": "The active-play phenomenon started byWii Sportsnow spreads to your whole body thanks toWii Fitand the pressure-sensitive Wii Balance Board, which comes bundled with it. Used together players will experience an extensive array of fun, dynamic and surprisingly challenging activities, including aerobics, yoga, muscle stretches and balance oriented games. The focus of these activities is towards providing a \"core\" workout, a popular exercise method that emphasizes slower, controlled motions, but it's the fun approach to fitness ofWii Fitthat will keep players hooked on fitness for years to come.Have fun while you get fitThe Wii Balance Board.View larger.Calculate your BMI and Wii Fit age.View larger.Enjoy a wide variety of mini-games.View larger.Follow your own personal trainer.View larger.Track your progress against friends.View larger.TheWii FitBalance BoardThe primary tenet ofWii Fitis balance. Your center of balance, the point between your left and right sides when you stand upright, has a lot to do with your health. Those without an even center of balance will be unnaturally compensating for this imbalance, which causes their posture to become misaligned, increasing the possibility of putting unnecessary strain on their bodies. This is where the Wii Balance Board comes in.Similar in appearance to a step aerobics board, the Wii Balance Board is much, much more. Easily capable of supporting weights up to a maximum of 300 pounds, it is sturdy and precise, able to measure weight and register pressure accurately when placed on a variety of flat surfaces. This advanced level of sensitivity allows for both the wide range of activities found in theWii Fitsoftware as well as the board's amazing ability recognize individual players by their weight alone.Getting Started: Create a ProfileBefore you jump into doing exercises and activities, you&#146;ll start by creating a profile.

        "B0001VGFK2": "It may not be a splashy leap forward, but Rockstar Games'Grand Theft Auto: San Andreasin its own deep, dark way does just as much to move and revolutionize video games as its two predecessors,Grand Theft Auto IIIandGrand Theft Auto: Vice City. As in previous installments, here you play as a thug with problems you must steal and shoot your way out of, but the problems this time are disconcertingly more realistic. You play as Carl Johnson, known on the street as CJ, a likeable criminal type who has just returned to his hometown, Los Santos (a fictionalized Los Angeles), to find that his mother has been murdered and that the police have framed him for another murder. Reunions with his friends and a troubled relationship with his brother set off a sprawling, complex plot line, taking place at first in the immediate Los Santos area but eventually spilling into San Fierro (based on San Francisco) and Las Venturas (Las Vegas).You play as Carl Johnson, known on the street as CJ.This is an honest effort to create an engaging story about sympathetic characters caught up in a brutal environment that is on par with a movie or novel.Gaming GangstersWhereVice Citytook its cues, with tongue firmly in cheek, from the 1980s television seriesMiami Vice,San Andreasis a sincere homage to early 1990s innercity gangster films likeMenace 2 SocietyandBoyz &#x91;N the Hood. This is an honest effort to create an engaging story about sympathetic characters caught up in a brutal environment that is on par with a movie or novel. If that effort hits a few flat notes (you would have to be totally desensitized not to wonder if it's OK to make entertainment out of driveby shootings), it may also mark the first step toward video games growing up.  The first thing that fans of earlierGTAgames will notice is the range of action is much wider now: Along with shooting, running, and driving, there's now swimming, eating, working out, shopping, and, yes, getting a haircut. All this means the game has a fairly steep learning curve. But, though the pick-up-and-play appeal ofGrand Theft Auto IIImay be long gone, your access to the action becomes fairly transparent after a little practice. My only serious complaint is that, with the controller now crowded with such previously unheard-of functions like \"Gang Active\" and \"Talk Positive,\" you can drive only with the left analog stick. A minor point, but it makes cars a lot more difficult to handle.Bicycles take on a surprisingly central role.Vehicular VarietyIt would be hard to surpass the variety of automobiles available in earlier games, andSan Andreaswisely does not for the most part try to compete on that score. Instead, it's bicycles of all things that steal the show. The bikes' speed and flexibility are perfect for many of the missions, and there is something about cruising through the streets and basketball courts on a BMX that just feels right. If you play far enough into the game, you will also be rewarded with the chance to fly a number of aircraft, and flying is something Rockstar makes a greater effort to get right this time (welcome news for anyone who struggled with the planes and &#x91;copters of the earlier games).Lackluster Graphics--but a Real FeelGraphics--never a huge priority for Rockstar--actually take a step backward from the luscious, tropical look ofVice City. Textures are rendered with only a cursory attention to detail, and contours are often blocky. It scarcely matters, though, because no matter howSan Andreaslooks, itfeelsreal. This is due in no small part to voice work by an all-star cast including Samuel L. Jackson, Ice T, James Woods, Peter Fonda, and Outkast's Big Boy and a stellar soundtrack with tunes by Soundgarden, 2Pac, Public Enemy, and even a few country classics from the likes of Willie Nelson. But it's not just realistic,San Andreasis also vast, encompassing three big urban centers and huge swaths of rural land (complete with shotgun-toting farmers) between them. This vastness does mean, however, that there can be a lot of tedious driving to get to the missions, which, along with some awkward sequencing of the cut scenes (they are in places stacked one on top of the other), means that there is a bit too much downtime.  But never mind the quibbles.

        "0061791784": "Starred Review. Set in the summer of 1917, Todd's excellent second mystery featuring British nurse Bess Crawford (after 2009's A Duty to the Dead) smoothly blends realistic characters with an intricate plot. When Bess accompanies Lt. Meriwether Evanson, a severe burn victim, from the Continent to England, she's surprised to spot the pilot's supposedly devoted wife, Marjorie, crying on another man's shoulder at a train station. After returning to saving lives under German fire in France, Bess is stunned to read in a newspaper that Marjorie has been stabbed to death in London. Soon after, the depressed lieutenant commits suicide by cutting his own throat. Unable to resist involving herself in the murder investigation, Bess seeks to identify Marjorie's unknown companion, the possible killer. In addition to supplying a challenging puzzle, Todd (a mother-son writing team) does a superb job of capturing the feel of the battlefield and the emotional toll taken on those waiting back home for a loved one's return.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0061335290": "British philosopher Flew has long been something of an evangelist for atheism, debating theologians and pastors in front of enormous crowds. In 2004, breathless news reports announced that the nonagenarian had changed his mind. This book tells why. Ironically, his arguments about the absurdity of God-talk launched a revival of philosophical theists, some of whom, like Alvin Plantinga and Richard Swinburne, were important in Flew's recent conversion to theism. Breakthroughs in science, especially cosmology, also played a part: if the speed or mass of the electron were off just a little, no life could have evolved on this planet. Perhaps the arrogance of the New Atheists also emboldened him, as Flew taunts them for failing to live up to the greatness of atheists of yore. The book concludes with an appendix by New Testament scholar and Anglican bishop N.T. Wright, arguing for the coherence of Christian belief in the resurrection. Flew praises Wright, though he maintains some distance still from orthodox Christianity. The book will be most avidly embraced by traditional theists seeking argumentative ammunition. It sometimes disappoints: quoting other authorities at length, citing religion-friendly scientists for pages at a time and belaboring side issues, like the claim that Einstein was really a religious believer of sorts.(Nov.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Test yourSuperfreakonomicsknow-how now:Question 1:5 pointsAccording toSuperfreakonomics, what has been most helpful in improving the lives of women in rural India?A. The government ban on dowries and sex-selective abortionsB. The spread of cable and satellite televisionC. Projects that pay women to not abort female babiesD. Condoms made specially for the Indian marketQuestion 2:3 pointsAmong Chicago street prostitutes, which night of the week is the most profitable?A. SaturdayB. MondayC. WednesdayD. FridayQuestion 3:5 pointsYou land in an emergency room with a serious condition and your fate lies in the hands of the doctor you draw. Which characteristic doesn&#x2019;t seem to matter in terms of doctor skill?A. Attended a top-ranked medical school and served a residency at a prestigious hospitalB. Is femaleC. Gets high ratings from peersD. Spends more money on treatmentQuestion 4:3 pointsWhich cancer is chemotherapy more likely to be effective for?A. Lung cancerB. MelanomaC. LeukemiaD. Pancreatic cancerQuestion 5:5 pointsHalf of the decline in deaths from heart disease is mainly attributable to:A. Inexpensive drugsB. AngioplastyC. GraftsD. StentsQuestion 6:3 pointsTrue or False: Child car seats do a better job of protecting children over the age of 2 from auto fatalities than regular seat belts.Question 7:5 pointsWhat&#x2019;s the best thing a person can do  personally  to cut greenhouse gas emissions?A. Drive a hybrid carB. Eat one less hamburger a weekC. Buy all your food from local sourcesQuestion 8:3 pointsWhich is most effective at stopping the greenhouse effect?A. Public-awareness campaigns to discourage consumptionB. Cap-and-trade agreements on carbon emissionsC. Volcanic explosionsD. Planting lots of treesQuestion 9:5 pointsIn the 19th century, one of the gravest threats of childbearing was puerperal fever, which was often fatal to mother and child.  Its cause was finally determined to be:A. Tight bindings of petticoats early in the pregnancyB. Foul air in the delivery wardsC. Doctors not taking sanitary precautionsD. The mother rising too soon in the delivery roomQuestion 10:3 pointsWhich of the following were not aftereffects of the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks on September 11, 2001:A. The decrease in airline traffic slowed the spread of influenza.B. Thanks to extra police in Washington, D.C., crime fell in that city.C. The psychological effects of the attacks caused people to cut back on their consumption of alcohol, which led to a decrease in traffic accidents.D. The increase in border security was a boon to some California farmers, who, as   Mexican and Canadian imports declined, sold so much marijuana that it became one of the states most valuable crops.Answers and ScoringQuestion 1B, Cable and satellite TV. Women with television were less willing to tolerate wife beating, less likely to admit to having a &#x201C;son preference,&#x201D; and more likely to exercise personal autonomy. Plus, the men were perhaps too busy watching cricket.Question 2A, Saturday nights are the most profitable. While Friday nights are the busiest, the single greatest determinant of a prostitute&#x2019;s price is the specific trick she is hired to perform. And for whatever reason, Saturday customers purchase more expensive services.Question 3C, One factor that doesn&#x2019;t seem to matter is whether a doctor is highly rated by his or her colleagues. Those named as best by their colleagues turned out to be no better than average at lowering death rates--although they did spend less money on treatments.Question 4C, Leukemia.  Chemotherapy has proven effective on some cancers, including leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin&#x2019;s disease, and testicular cancer, especially if these cancers are detected early. But in most cases, chemotherapy is remarkably ineffective, often showing zero discernible effect. That said, cancer drugs make up the second-largest category of pharmaceutical sales, with chemotherapy comprising the bulk.Question 5A, Inexpensive drugs. Expensive medical procedures, while technologically dazzling, are responsible for a remarkably small share of the improvement in heart disease. Roughly half of the decline has come from reductions in risk factors like high cholesterol and high blood pressure, both of which are treated with relatively inexpensive drugs. And much of the remaining decline is thanks to ridiculously inexpensive treatments like aspirin, heparin, ACE inhibitors, and beta-blockers.Question 6False. Based on extensive data analysis as well as crash tests paid for by the authors, old-fashioned seat belts do just as well as car seats.Question 7B, Shifting less than one day per week&#x2019;s worth of calories from red meat and dairy products to chicken, fish, eggs, or a vegetable-based diet achieves more greenhouse-gas reduction than buying all locally sourced food, according to a recent study by Christopher Weber and H. Scott Matthews, two Carnegie Mellon researchers.  Every time a Prius or other hybrid owner drives to the grocery store, she may be cancelling out its emissions-reducing benefit, at least if she shops in the meat section. Emission from cows, as well as sheep and other ruminants, are 25 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than the carbon dioxide released by cars and humans.Question 8C, the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines discharged more than 20 million tons of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere, which acted like a layer of sunscreen, reducing the amount of solar radiation and cooling off the earth by an average of one degree F.Question 9C, doctors not taking sanitary precautions.  This was the dawning age of the autopsy, and doctors did not yet know the importance of washing their hands after leaving the autopsy room and entering the delivery room.Question 10C, the psychological effect of the attacks caused people to increase their alcohol consumption, and traffic accidents increased as a result.Scoring32-40: Certified SuperFreak25-31: Freak--surprises lay in wait for you16-24: Wannabe freak--you&#x2019;ve got some reading to do1-15: Conventional wisdomer--you&#x2019;re still thinking in old ways",

The inclusion of subtitle \"Origins\" in the game's title refers to the six unique origin stories available to new heroes as a new game begins. Each of these has an impact on the player's motivations and his or her experience, and renders a unique prelude, path, and possible ending(s) to the game. There are many different endings to the game based on the origin story of the character and the choices you make as you play through the game. The game features three character classes--warrior, mage, and rogue--and three races of being--Human, Elf or Dwarf--that can assume these classes. Although most game elements, such as weapons, magic, etc., are available to any character, each class and race has different strengths, abilities and affinities which lend themselves to better utilizing different elements.Dragon Age: Originsis a single player game based on party-based gameplay and combat where the player can join, control and quest with up to three non-player characters (NPCs). Players can also quest alone if they so choose, but with the chance of survival are slim. Convincing NPCs to join you, and treating them well may be necessary depending on the varying sentiments between the player and the NPC, or between the NPC's in the party based on the chosen history written into the origin story accepted at the beginning of the game.

If Elmore Leonard hadn't already used it for thesequeltoGet Shorty, it would have been a natural title for this deliciously breezy follow-up to another Leonard-to-Hollywood hit,Out of Sight. You may best recall Jack Foley, as played by George Clooney, bantering with Jennifer Lopez in the trunk of a jailbreak getaway car, but whenOut of Sightended, Foley was headed back to the clink to finish a 30-year bid.Road Dogsopens with Foley on the van to prison with Cundo Rey, a pint-size Cuban who soon engineers their early release--legally, this time. Jack's happy to be out and enjoying the California hospitality of Cundo and his wife Dawn (both Leonard veterans too, fromLaBravaandRiding the Rap). But Dawn is lovely and wily (and maybe a psychic), Cundo is a murderously jealous husband who may well think Jack owes him big-time, and Jack? Well, when you've robbed a hundred-twenty or so banks, is it that easy to go straight? As so often with Leonard, the real fun is less in the action than the talk, especially from Foley, the pleasure-minded, level-headed hood: an ex-con whose biggest con may be that he is exactly who he says he is.--Tom NissleyQuestions for Elmore LeonardQ:Where did the inspiration for the titleRoad Dogscome from?A:Road Dogswas on a list of prison expressions my researcher Gregg Sutter got for me: inmates who watch each other&#x2019;s back. I liked the sound of the words together.Q: What made you decide to bring back Jack Foley, Cundo Rey, and Dawn Navarro now? What is it about these three characters that stuck with you through the years?A:Foley was played by George Clooney inOut of Sight. I imagined George in the scenes I wrote and it worked. Dawn Navarro was the psychic inRiding the Rap, a supporting character ready for a leading role. Cundo Rey fromLaBrava, another favorite of mine, also deserved a bigger role, so I brought him back..Q: Any chance Foley and the woman he loves, Federal Marshal Karen Sisco, will be back in the near future?A:I&#x2019;m not sure Foley is up to robbing another bank. But Karen Sisco, the federal marshal inOut of Sight, could show up again; maybe working for her dad, a private investigator.Q: One of the hallmarks of your writing is your gift for the telling detail. When Foley is offering Cundo Rey&#x2019;s money man, Jimmy, some advice about his skimming, he tells him that Cundo won&#x2019;t kill him, but he might &#x201C;break your legs with a Jos&#233; Canseco bat.&#x201D; That&#x2019;s one of those small yet wonderfully deft touches that adds color without slowing the pace. How do you do this so well?A:Realism is the key to my style of writing and dialogue is what keeps it moving, always in live scenes. Rather than use my voice, my language, to describe what&#x2019;s going on, I let the characters tell who they are and what they&#x2019;re up to by the way they talk. Scenes are written from a character&#x2019;s point of view, never mine.Q: Many of your characters are working class stiffs and tough, intelligent broads. What draws you to these kind of characters? What do you think accounts for their popularity?A:My women often upstage the guys; they&#x2019;re natural, their own person, while my cops and criminals talk the way I&#x2019;ve observed them through research and being on the scene.Q: What&#x2019;s next for Elmore Leonard?A:Next comesDjibouti, with Dara Barr, a documentary filmmaker with the Somali pirates off the coast of East Africa.",
        "0060195339": "Sportswriter Leavy describes her book as not so much a biography of a ballplayer as a social history of baseball, with the former star pitcher's career as the barometer of change. While both a preface and an introduction spin Leavy's storytelling wheels, a compelling, literary social history does indeed get rolling. Koufax refused to participate in the project, so Leavy has spoken to hundreds of people with something to share on the former Brooklyn/L.A. Dodger Hank Aaron, Joe Torre, childhood friend and Mets co-owner Fred Wilpon and even the old Dodgers equipment manager among them and their testimonies make for a rich baseball pastiche and an engaging look at the game's more innocent period. Koufax capped off his first year by watching the 1955 World Series against the hated Yankees from the bench, and following the Dodgers' historic victory headed from Yankee Stadium to class at Columbia University, where he studied architecture (in case the baseball thing didn't work out). Even when Leavy's historical anecdotes are quaint, they prove timely: she details Koufax holding out for a better contract with fellow star pitcher Don Drysdale in '66, paving the way for free agency. While Leavy's interest in Koufax's Jewish heritage at times seems to border on the obsessive, she delivers an honest and exquisitely detailed examination of a complex man, one whose skills were such that slugger Willie Stargell once likened hitting against Koufax to \"trying to drink coffee with a fork.\"Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.",

As the samurai Samanosuke,  players volunteer to rescue the kidnapped princess Yuki. No surprise  that the ultimate goal (and the entire story line, for that matter)  falls by the wayside as hordes of demons converge on the player hour  after hour. The weapons system benefits from the flashy graphics--as  players discover and add gems to a gauntlet, weapon upgrades increase  firepower with increasingly dramatic effects.Graphically, the game is stunning. Carving through the levels--forests,  tunnels, and the requisite dark, dank castle environment--isn't  anything less than a spectacular experience, thanks much in part to the  game's unusually high production values. Character models are built  from up to 10,000 polygons each--high detail, even for a PS2 game.  Subtle environmental effects--the wind flowing through the trees, for  instance, ripples the fabric in characters' clothes--furthers the  game's realism. The game's backgrounds are painstakingly detailed and  nicely enhanced by dynamic lighting effects.The talent behind the aural effects is just as impressive. Japanese  actor Takeshi Kaneshiro lent his voice to the main character, and a  200-piece orchestra delivers a dramatic score.Call over any PS2 skeptics in your neighborhood, then load upOnimusha: Warlords.

This sequel is even more bloody, violent, and sadistic than its popular  predecessors, offering up an enormous 3-D city in which nearly any  criminal act is possible. Players are free to steal cars, beat up the  local population for their money (or weapons), make time with  prostitutes, or simply roam to their heart's content. Those seeking  more structure can embark on dozens of plot-driven missions or steal  cars that let them play minigames. Nab a cop car and go on vigilante  missions. Grab a cab and play a deadly version ofCrazy Taxi.  Take a fire truck and earn money putting out fires. The game just never  gets boring.As in real life, there are consequences for your criminality. As your  random acts of mayhem mount up, the police start hounding you,  eventually calling in SWAT trucks, the FBI, and even the army if you  continue down the path of destruction. Shaking these pursuers is easily  the most fun part of the game, especially when a bunch of friends are  packed in the room to witness your narrow escapes.Grand Theft Auto IIIis fine-tuned to near perfection in every  category. All the vehicles, from slick sports cars to lumbering dump  trucks, handle exactly as you'd expect and smash apart realistically  when abused. The three islands in the game are rendered in terrific  detail considering their size, and are packed with traffic,  pedestrians, and hidden jumps. The audio is equally amazing.

When she arrives at St. Elizabeth's, a home for pregnant girls in Habit, Kentucky, Rose Clinton seems as evasive and deceptive as the other unwed mothers. But Rose is different: she has a husband whom she has deserted. Unlike most St. Elizabeth's visitors, she neither gives up her baby nor leaves the home, staying on as cook while her daughter grows up among expectant mothers fantasizing that they, too, might keep their infants. The reader learns from Rose how she came to St. Elizabeth's, but it is her doting husband and rebellious daughter who reveal her motives and helpless need for freedom. Together, the three create a complex character study of a woman driven by forces she can neither understand nor control.- Thomas L.

        "0006476155": "This second big winter thriller by a writer named Patterson (see Fiction Forecasts, Oct. 19) features a villain (a multiple-personality serial killer/kidnapper) whom the publisher hopes will remind readers of Thomas Harris's Hannibal Lecter, and a hero who is compared to those of Jonathan Kellerman. Unfortunately, the novel has few merits of its own to set against those authors' works. Hero Alex Cross is in fact a black senior detective in Washington, D.C., who is also a psychiatrist and has a facile but not entirely convincing line of sentimental-cynical patter. The villain is Gary Soneji/Murphy (read Hyde/Jekyll), who kills for recognition, and finally kidnaps the kids of prominent parents. Alex is soon on the case, more enraged by Gary's killing of poor ghetto blacks than by the Lindbergh-inspired kidnapping, and becomes involved with a gorgeous, motorcycle-riding Secret Service supervisor who is not what she seems. Soneji/Murphy is eventually captured--but can the bad part of him be proven guilty? There is even a hint at the end that he may survive for a sequel, though the reader has virtually forgotten him by then. Spider reads fluently enough, but its action and characters seem to have come out of some movie-inspired never-never land. If a contemporary would-be nail-biter is to thrill as it should, it urgently needs stronger connections to reality than this book has.

        "006085880X": "Teenage suicide is the provocative topic that Picoult plumbs, with mixed results, in her fifth novel. Popular high-school swimming star Chris Harte and talented artist Em Gold bonded as infants; their parents have been next-door neighbors and best friends for 18 years. When they fall in love, everyone is ecstatic. Everyone, it turns out, except for Em, who finds that sex with Chris feels almost incestuous. Her emotional turmoil, compounded by pregnancy, which she keeps secret, leads to depression, despair and a desire for suicide, and she insists that Chris prove his love by pulling the trigger. The gun is fired in the first paragraph, and so the book opens with a jolt of adrenaline. But Picoult stumbles in delineating both sets of parents' responses to the tragedy. Unconvincing behavior and dialogue inappropriate to the situation (plus, most importantly, the fact that the parents fail to discuss crucial topics) never touch the essence of bereavement and thus destroy credibility. Picoult redeems herself in flashbacks that reveal the two marital relationships and the personalities of both couples; and she sensitively explores the question of how well parents can ever know their children. After Chris is accused of murder and jailed, the narrative acquires impressive authenticity and suspense, with even the minor characters evoked with Picoult's keen eye for telling detail. The courtroom scenes (reminiscent of Picoult's 1996 novel, Mercy), are taut and well paced. Readers may remain unconvinced, however, that an intelligent young man like Chris would not have sought some help rather than respond to his lover's desperate request.

Across the city's archdiocese, trusted priests have been accused of the worst possible betrayal of the souls in their care. InFaith, Jennifer Haigh explores the fallout for one devout family, the McGanns.Estranged for years from her difficult and demanding relatives, Sheila McGann has remained close to her older brother Art, the popular, dynamic pastor of a large suburban parish. When Art finds himself at the center of the maelstrom, Sheila returns to Boston, ready to fight for him and his reputation. What she discovers is more complicated than she imagined. Her strict, lace-curtain-Irish mother is living in a state of angry denial. Sheila's younger brother Mike, to her horror, has already convicted his brother in his heart. But most disturbing of all is Art himself, who persistently dodges Sheila's questions and refuses to defend himself.As the scandal forces long-buried secrets to surface,Faithexplores the corrosive consequences of one family's history of silence&mdash;and the resilience its members ultimately find in forgiveness. Throughout, Haigh demonstrates how the truth can shatter our deepest beliefs&mdash;and restore them. A gripping, suspenseful tale of one woman's quest for the truth,Faithis a haunting meditation on loyalty and family, doubt and belief. Elegantly crafted, sharply observed, this is Jennifer Haigh's most ambitious novel to date.A Q&amp;A with Author Jennifer HaighQ:What was your inspiration for writingFaith?Haigh:When I moved to Boston from Iowa in 2002, the city was reeling from revelations that Catholic priests had molested children, and that the Archdiocese had covered up the abuse. I was reeling too:  I was raised in a Catholic family, spent twelve years in parochial schools and had extremely fond memories of my interactions with Catholic clergy. It&rsquo;s no exaggeration to say that nuns and priests were the heroes of my childhood.  Like many people, I was horrified by what had happened in Boston--and, as later became clear, in Catholic dioceses across the country.Faithwas my attempt to explain the inexplicable, to understand what I couldn&rsquo;t make sense of in any other way.Q:Exploring the interplay between parents and children and among siblings is a delicate art that is not easily mastered, even for seasoned writers. How do you, as a storyteller, work to keep your story emotionally evocative&mdash;pulling the reader in with a depth of feeling&mdash;without falling into melodrama or treacle?Haigh:I don&rsquo;t try to make the reader feel any particular way. I just try to be accurate, to show people as they are.Q:Faithis told from the point of view of Art&rsquo;s sister, Sheila. It&rsquo;s a surprising choice, since she doesn&rsquo;t actually witness the events in question. Why did you approach the story in this way?Haigh:It took me a while to figure out how to tell this story.  When I read account of priests who&rsquo;d been accused of sexual abuse, I was struck by the difficulty of getting to the bottom of such cases. Often it comes down to one person&rsquo;s word against another:   only two people know for sure what happened, and sometimes the child is too traumatized to remember it clearly.  As Sheila tells the story, she&rsquo;s struggling to arrive at the truth, to find out whether her brother could possibly have done the things he&rsquo;s accused of, to imagine what he thought and felt, to get inside his head. In a sense, it mirrors the way all novels are written.  To me, writing is an exercise in empathy.Q:Over the course of four novels, you&rsquo;ve broadened your skills and honed your narrative dexterity, from the exquisite character sketches ofMrs. Kimble, to broader questions of family, religion, and society in the rich, multi-layered family drama that isFaith. What are you working on next?Haigh:My current project is a collection of short stories set in Bakerton, the Pennsylvania coal town where my second novel,Baker Towers, took place.Q:What inspires you as a writer&mdash;and as a reader?  Who has influenced your writing and who you are as a person?Haigh:Like all writers, I am a reader first. When my work is going well, I read. When it&rsquo;s going badly, I read more.

The question is, as you travel through the decrepit and beautiful fallen city beneath the waves, hunting for answers and the solution to your own survival, are you really the hunter, or the hunted?Gameplay and MultiplayerInBioShock 2players will take on the role of the original Big Daddy, not that of game one protagonist, Jack. As a Big Daddy you will have access to all the strengths and weapons of a standard Big Daddy, including the drill and rivet gun. More importantly you also possess free will and the ability to use plasmids and gene tonics &#151; genetic modifications allowed for through ADAM, a stem cell harvested from conquered enemies, or sea slugs outside the Rapture air lock, and powered by the in-game injectable serum known as EVE, which can be found, captured or purchased. Plasmids and gene tonics provide a wide range of aggressive and passive abilities which can be upgraded and arranged for quick use. The ability to use plasmids and tonics gives you a decided edge over other Big Daddies and most other denizens of Rapture, excluding the powerful Big Sisters. In addition, due to their role as a Big Daddy, players will experience a new relation to the Little Sisters. Upon defeating standard Big Daddys you are given the familiar choice as to whether to harvest or adopt them. Harvesting gains you ADAM immediately, but could alter your path through the game, while adopting makes you responsible for Little Sisters, who then accompany you through Rapture, but also provide aid and warning in times of danger. Additional gameplay features include: new plasmids, weapons and the ability to combine these two.The game also features the anticipated multiplayer modes. Several of these are team-based, allowing up to 10 players. Within these players are provided with a rich prequel experience that expands the origins of theBioShockfiction, and allows you to play as one of several characters pulled from Rapture's history before the events of the first game.Key FeaturesThe Big Sister- No longer just something to be harvested or not, the Big Sister is the most powerful resident in Rapture.You Are the Big Daddy- Take control with the original prototype Big Daddy, and experience the power and raw strength of Rapture&rsquo;s most feared denizens as you battle powerful new enemies.New Plasmids- New plasmids such as \"Aero Dash\" allowing for bursts of speed over short distances, and \"Geyser Trap\" a stream of water used as a jump pad and electrical conductor, join the ample list of Plasmids from the original game.New Game Mechanics-BioShock 2contains many new gameplay mechanics. Just a few of these are: the ability to wield plasmids and weapons simultaneously; flashback missions detailing how you became the Big Daddy; the ability to walk outside the airlocks of Rapture to discover new play areas, and many more.New Locations- Just a few of the locations and environments debuting inBioShock 2are Fontaine Futuristics, headquarters of Fontaine's business empire and the Kashmir Restaurant.Evolution of the Genetically Enhanced Shooter- Innovative advances bring new depth and dimension to each encounter, allowing players to create exciting combinations to fit their style of gameplay.Return to Rapture- Set approximately 10 years after the events of the original BioShock, the story continues with an epic, more intense journey through one of the most captivating and terrifying fictional worlds ever created.Genetically Enhanced Multiplayer- Earn experience points during gameplay to earn access to new weapons, plasmids and tonics that can be used to create hundreds of different combinations.Experience Rapture&rsquo;s Civil War- Players will step into the shoes of Rapture's citizens and take direct part in the civil war that tore Rapture apart.See Rapture Before the Fall- Experience Rapture before it was reclaimed by the ocean and engage in combat over iconic environments in locations such as Kashmir Restaurant and Mercury Suites, all of which have been reworked from the ground up for multiplayer.",

        "0062024035": "A Q&amp;A with Author Veronica RothQ:What advice would you offer to young aspiring writers, who long to live a success story like your own?Roth:One piece of advice I have is: Want something else more than success. Success is a lovely thing, but your desire to say something, your worth, and your identity shouldn&rsquo;t rely on it, because it&rsquo;s not guaranteed and it&rsquo;s not permanent and it&rsquo;s not sufficient. So work hard, fall in love with the writing&mdash;the characters, the story, the words, the themes&mdash;and make sure that you are who you are regardless of your life circumstances. That way, when the good things come, they don&rsquo;t warp you, and when the bad things hit you, you don&rsquo;t fall apart.Q:You&rsquo;re a young author--is it your current adult perspective or not-so-recent teenage perspective that brought about the factions in the development of this story? Do you think that teens or adults are more likely to fit into categories in our current society?Roth:Other aspects of my identity have more to do with the factions than my age. The faction system reflects my beliefs about human nature&mdash;that we can make even something as well-intentioned as virtue into an idol, or an evil thing. And that virtue as an end unto itself is worthless to us. I did spend a large portion of my adolescence trying to be as &ldquo;good&rdquo; as possible so that I could prove my worth to the people around me, to myself, to God, to everyone. It&rsquo;s only now that I&rsquo;m a little older that I realize I am unable to be truly &ldquo;good&rdquo; and that it&rsquo;s my reasons for striving after virtue that need adjustment more than my behavior. In a sense,Divergentis me writing through that realization&mdash;everyone in Beatrice&rsquo;s society believes that virtue is the end, the answer. I think that&rsquo;s a little twisted.I think we all secretly love and hate categories&mdash;love to get a firm hold on our identities, but hate to be confined&mdash;and I never loved and hated them more than when I was a teenager. That said: Though we hear a lot about high school cliques, I believe that adults categorize each other just as often, just in subtler ways. It is a dangerous tendency of ours. And it begins in adolescence.Q:If you could add one more faction to the world withinDivergent, what would it be?Roth:I tried to construct the factions so that they spanned a wide range of virtues. Abnegation, for example, includes five of the traditional &ldquo;seven heavenly virtues:&rdquo; chastity, temperance, charity, patience, and humility. That said, it would be interesting to have a faction centered on industriousness, in which diligence and hard work are valued most, and laziness is not allowed. They would be in constant motion, and would probably be happy to take over for the factionless. And hard-working people can certainly take their work too far, as all the factions do with their respective virtues. I&rsquo;m not sure what they would wear, though. Overalls, probably.Q:What do you think are the advantages, if any, to the society you&rsquo;ve created inDivergent?Roth:All the advantages I see only seem like advantages to me because I live in our current society. For example, the members of their society don&rsquo;t focus on certain things: race, religion, sexual orientation, political affiliation, etc. I mean, a world in which you look different from the majority and no one minds? That sounds good to me. But when I think about it more, I realize that they&rsquo;re doing the exact same thing we do, but with different criteria by which to distinguish ourselves from others. Instead of your skin color, it&rsquo;s the color of your shirt that people assess, or the results of your aptitude test. Same problem, different system.Q:What book are you currently reading and how has it changed you, if at all?Roth:I recently finishedImaginary Girlsby Nova Ren Suma, which I would call &ldquo;contemporary with a paranormal twist,&rdquo; or something to that effect. It&rsquo;s about a girl whose sister has a powerful kind of magnetism within the confines of a particular town, and how their love for each other breaks some things apart and puts other things back together. It was refreshing to read a young adult book that is about sisterhood instead of romance. It&rsquo;s one of those books that makes you love a character and then hate a character and then love them again&mdash;that shows you that people aren&rsquo;t all good or all bad, but somewhere in between.Imaginary Girlsgave me a lot to think about, and the writing was lovely, which I always love to see.--This text refers to theHardcoveredition.",

Now the Vancouver-based entrepreneur traverses the continent with his \"Millionaire Mind Intensive Seminar,\" on which this debut motivational business manual is based. What sets it apart is Eker's focus on the way people think and feel about money and his canny, class-based analyses of broad differences among groups. In rat-a-tat, \"Let me explain\" seminar-speak, Eker asks readers to think back to their childhoods and pick apart the lessons they passively absorbed from parents and others about money. With such psychological nuggets as \"Rich people focus on opportunities/ Poor people focus on obstacles,\" Eker puts a positive spin on stereotypes, arguing that poverty begins, or rather, is allowed to continue, in one's imagination first, with actual material life becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. To that end, Eker counsels for admiration and against resentment, for positivity, self-promotion and thinking big and against wallowing, self-abnegation and small-mindedness. While much of the advice is self-evident, Eker's contribution is permission to think of one's financial foibles as a kind of mental illness&mdash;one, he says, that has a ready set of cures.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

After Henry Dashwood dies, the Dashwood sisters and their mother are given a house by kindly rich relatives John and Mary Middleton, while the estate that was the Dashwood home passes to the sisters' henpecked half-brother John and his status-conscious wife Fanny. Elinor, the responsible eldest Dashwood sister, is smitten with Fanny's brother Edward Ferrars, though she hasn't heard from him since the move, and he, unbeknownst to her, has been dating the daffy Lucy Steele. Delicate, dramatic, and gorgeous, middle sister Marianne falls for eye-candy John \"Wills\" Willoughby, though he treads on her heart by publicly rejecting her. All this is conveyed in formal prose with equally stiff dialogue, which makes Trollope's offhand mentions of laptops and Range Rovers somewhat jarring. And yet, Trollope's faithfulness to the tropes of this story keep her from letting the plot jibe with the modern world, though she does wink at that: \"You're like those nineteenth-century novels where marriage is the only career option for a middle-class girl.\" The book's resolution for Marianne seems especially unlikely in this era, and could have benefitted from a more malleable adaptation.

Factor in her on-again, off-again romance with old high school flame Daniel Stipanek, counterfeit antiques and her mom's alcoholism, and the plucky heroine has enough problems to drive at least three novels.

        "B0009VXAM0": "As DVD playback made the PlayStation 2 more than just a game machine, hefty multi-media features make the Sony PlayStation 3 an even more versatile home entertainment machine. Features such as video chat, Internet access, digital photo viewing, and digital audio and video will likely make it the central component of your media set-up. Still, it is first and foremost a game console--a powerful one at that.Under the HoodThe PS3 features IBM's \"Cell\" processor and a co-developed Nvidia graphics processor that makes the system able to perform two trillion calculations per second. That's approximately 320 times more calculations per second than the PS2. Along with the traditional AV and composite connections, it also boasts an HDMI port, which delivers uncompressed, unconverted digital picture and sound to compatible high-definition TV and projectors. The system is capable of 128-bit pixel precision and 1080p resolution for a full HD experience.PlayStation 3: Tower of powerA sleek new lookWith the wireless, motion-sensitive controllerBlu-Ray is the New WaySony's PlayStation 3 games are encoded onto the Blu-Ray disc media format, which can hold six times as much data as traditional DVDs. This increase in capacity--combined with the awesome power of its processor and graphics card--promises mind-blowing games once developers have learned how to fully harness the new console's power. The PS3 will also support CD-ROM, CD-RW, DVD, DVD-ROM, DVD-R, DVD+R formats.In addition, PlayStation 3 system software update version 2.20 and up includesBD Live support. With this you can now play discs that support Blu-ray Disc Profile 2.0 (BD-LIVE) and you can also connect to the Internet while playing discs that support this format so that you can obtain additional features. Features that are available vary depending on the software in use.Sensational ControllerNew gamers intuitively move the controller while playing, even though that movement has traditionally had no relation to what's going on in the game. Sony has picked up on this tendency and is using it to bring a new level of control into the PS3. Inside the controller is a high-precision six-axis sensing system that accurately detects fine movements in pitch, roll, and yaw, as well as three dimensions of movement, to control games. This means that future PS3 games will be controlled by the movements of your hands rather than just your thumbs. For example, you might be able to steer a car by holding the controller like a steering wheel.While the PS3 controller looks much like its Dual Shock predecessors, it will lack the force-feedback vibration since that would only interfere with the sensing system. It uses Bluetooth 2.0 wireless technology and can support up to seven wireless controllers at a time. It's a hot-swappable system, so if your controller is running low on power, just pause your game and connect a USB 2.0 cable. You can continue playing while your controller recharges automatically.Plays All PlayStation GamesThe PlayStation 3 will be backward compatible with PlayStation and PlayStation 2 games, which means you'll be able to play all your favorite games without keeping all the old systems. The console will have slots for Memory Stick Duo, an SD slot and a Compact Flash memory slot. It comes with a pre-installed hard disc drive, which allows you to save games as well as download content from the Internet.Gran Turismo HDResistance: Fall of ManA Slew of New GamesA whole host of game publishers are already backing the PS3 and several have even confirmed games for the console. At the 2006 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), more than 30 titles were displayed for the system, includingGran Turismo HD,Resistance: Fall of Man, andFinal Fantasy XIII. Previously announced titles includeMetal Gear Solid 4,Devil May Cry 4andTekken 6.OnlineSony has stated that the PS3 will have similar online connectivity and services as the next generation of Xbox Live. Calling it \"an always on, always connected device,\" SCEI's chief technical officer Masa Chatani said the PS3 would be constantly in touch with a \"PlayStation World\" network \"fundamentally based on community, communication commerce, and content.\" Technically, the infrastructure is there to make that connection. The PS3 supports 10BASE-T, 100BASE-TX, 1000BASE-T Ethernet, as well as IEEE 802.11 b/g wireless networking protocols.",

The many clues that Laurel is different (she is strictly vegan; sunlight seems to shine through her fair skin; she never gets cold; she craves the outdoors; she doesn't menstruate) culminate in a bump on her back growing to the size of a softball and blooming into a flower that has foot-long petals. Returning to her parents' land, she meets Tamini, a faerie to whom she is attracted, who tells her that she is not human, but rather is a plant or, more specifically, a faerie. David, her accepting and supportive classmate, tests her tissue and confirms that Tamini is right. When a creepy alleged realtor pressures the family to sell the land, the teens become suspicious, and they are soon fighting for their lives in a centuries-old battle between faeries and trolls.

Players can earn up to 20 weapons (including online and offline) with up to four levels of upgrades for most weapons, plus new high-tech gadgets to help them through their journey.After word spreads of Ratchet and Clank's recent conquest inRatchet & Clank: Going Commando, Clank finds himself recognized as an interstellar robot of mystery and intrigue after starring in his own television series, Secret Agent Clank. While Ratchet is dismayed by his new sidekick status, the feelings are put aside when the twosome is called together by the Galactic President to bring peace to the universe. They find themselves traveling back to Planet Veldin to battle Dr. Nefarious, a robotic supervillain who has devised a diabolical scheme to wipe out all organic life in the galaxy. To reach his goal, he has instructed the Tyhrranoids, a race of multi-eye aliens to annihilate the organics. However, while Dr. Nefarious is aware that if the Tyhrranoids are successful, they will end up causing their own extinction, the Tyhrranoids are not aware of this danger.To fight back, Ratchet and Clank are able to recruit Captain Qwark, a favorite from previous games, out of retirement to lead the Q-Force, an unlikely band of heroic space cadets comprised of some of the most memorable characters from the Ratchet & Clank franchise. This includes Helga, the robotic seductress; Big Al, a techno-geek with the ability to encrypt technology systems; and Skidd McMarxx, a former hoverboarding champ and pro slacker turned spy. Together with the Q-Force, Ratchet and Clank set off on another hilarious interstellar romp to uncover the schemes of the sinister Dr. Nefarious and keep the galaxy safe for organic life.The Starship Phoenix, headquarters for the Q-Force, is the flagship in the fight against Dr. Nefarious and serves as a key information hub. The Starship is also where players can expect to receive new missions and training, and purchase armor and weapons. In addition, players will gain access to new vehicles, like the Turbo Slider or Hovership, to compete in races and combat enemies in intense battlefield missions. Refined intuitive enemy artificial intelligence means non-playable characters behave more intelligently by gathering information about their environments and forthcoming attacks, ultimately providing the player with more challenging gameplay.The multiplayer gameplay featured inRatchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenalis naturally suited for both the offline and online universe because it includes the variety of weapons, gadgets, vehicles and gameplay made famous throughout the Ratchet & Clank franchise. For those who want to experience the split screen multiplayer capabilities, up to four players can play offline, while the multiplayer online mode accommodates up to eight players over a broadband connection. In addition, six new levels are introduced for online play, featuring several elements that encourage team-based activities in modes such as capturing an enemy's base. For example, destructible environment obstacles in battlefield environments create strategic gameplay decisions and general mayhem. Commandeering multiple vehicles further encourages strategic co-op gameplay by allowing players to work together as one person navigates the vehicle while the other works its weapon's arsenal.In order to promote community gameplay, voice communication is supported online via the USB headset (for PlayStation2), allowing players to communicate with fellow team members during online games, either in-game or in the main lobby. The lobby area features an online friends list, allowing players to be matched up based on their gameplay statistics and will offer the ability to select from a variety of player skins.",
        "006182593X": "Starred Review. Family tragedy is healed by domestic routine in this quiet, tender memoir. When his daughter Amy died suddenly at the age of 38 from an asymptomatic heart condition, journalist and novelist Rosen-blatt (Lapham Rising) and his wife moved into her house to help her husband care for their three young children. Not much happens except for the mundane, crucial duties of child care: reading stories, helping with schoolwork, chasing after an indefatigable toddler who is the busiest person I have ever known, making toast to order for finicky kids. Building on the small events of everyday life, Rosenblatt draws sharply etched portraits of his grandchildren; his stoic, gentle son-in-law; his wife, who feels slightly guilty that she is living her daughter's life; and Amy emerges as a smart, prickly, selfless figure whose significance the author never registered until her death. Rosenblatt avoids the sentimentality that might have weighed down the story; he writes with humor and an engagement with life that makes the occasional flashes of grief all the more telling. The result is a beautiful account of human loss, measured by the steady effort to fill in the void.(Feb. 16)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

For his cousin, Roman, it is the vision that together they can find fortune in Liberty City, gateway to the land of opportunity. As they slip into debt and are dragged into a criminal underworld by a series of shysters, thieves and sociopaths, they discover that the reality is very different from the dream in a city that worships money and status, and is heaven for those who have them and a living nightmare for those who don&#146;t.Beginning with the 1997 release of the originalGrand Theft Auto, theGTAseries has been one of the most prolific, controversial and down right entertaining franchises in video games history. This pedigree of success guarantees that the highly anticipated eleventh game in the series,Grand Theft Auto IV, will garner at least as much attention if not more.Return to Liberty City.The dream as Niko expected it.View larger.There's always a catch.View larger.But some skills are international.View larger.The PlotGrand Theft Auto IVis a brand new adventure in theGTAuniverse following the experiences of Nikolai \"Niko\" Bellic, a new immigrant from an undisclosed eastern European country whose troubled pa st and the persuasion of his cousin Roman have brought him to the fictional Liberty City. Unfortunately, Niko&#146;s search for the American Dream and a much needed fresh start, hits an immediate snag when the rags to riches story Roman spun to pique Niko's interest is exposed as not only a complete fabrication, but a ploy to enlist Niko&#146;s well-known skills as a tough guy against the ample list of enemies clamoring for Roman&#146;s debt-ridden blood.Because Roman is the only person Niko knows in Liberty City he begrudgingly accepts his role as Roman&#146;s protector despite the deception. But as time goes on Niko comes into his own, and his experience on the wrong side of the tracks proves more valuable than he could have ever imagined as he fights for survival and later supremacy on the crime ridden streets of Liberty City.Game EnvironmentsBased on several of the boroughs of New York City and parts of New Jersey, Liberty City, familiar to players of previous games in the series, has been entirely redesigned forGTA IV. Players can expect visible detail down to the weeds growing in the cracks in the sidewalk, cars and buildings of visibly different ages and a much greater level if verticality in the buildings and bridges that they are able to explore as Niko moves through the city streets. In addition, pedestrians inGTA IVare much more realistic. No longer simply moving cardboard cutouts, these NPCs are intelligent, modern, human representations that laugh, cry, eat, drink, use cell phones and ATMs, and talking amongst themselves regardless of Niko&#146;s interaction with them.GameplayHistoricallyGTAgames have focused heavily on mission-based play, requiring successful completion of fixed tasks in order for players to progress through the game, but this has changed to a great extent inGTA IV. Players will experience an entirely new and exciting emphasis centered on the blending of on-mission and off-mission play, resulting not only in an increased sense of realism, but more interesting and unrestricted gameplay.FeaturesAside from the car jacking and a detailed city environment here are the new features forGTA IV:Improved combat system - Now you can use cover and also a target lock system, which allows you to take out targets with greater ease and accuracy. Plus, you can engage in some hand-to-hand combat if you can't get your hands on a piece quick enough.Cell phone - Not just for basic phone calls anymore. Use your in-game cell phone to receive missions via SMS, snap photos, and ZiT (tag) songs that can be downloaded exclusively on Amazon.com/mp3.Free time - In between missions you can take advantage of \"me\" time. There are gentleman's clubs, comedy clubs, bowling alleys, and bars, which all house unique activities.Take a break from the storyline - A variety of side missions allow you to help run a car service, \"borrow\" cop cars, assassinate targets, help solve problems for those on the street, or take to the air with stunt jumps that are scattered all over the city.Control your own fate - Throughout the game choice moments will arrive causing you to make a decision that will affect relationships and money.MultiplayerGive Niko a rest and create your own multiplayer \"hero.\"GTAhas added multiplayer modes allowing you to take your creation out to play online in competitive, co-op, and free form modes.

Drew assures Alice that the owner will be hands off, allowing her to run the gallery on her own. Her friends think it sounds too good to be true, but Alice sees a perfect opportunity to make a name for herself beyond the shadow of her famous father, an award-winning and controversial film maker.Everything is perfect until the morning Alice arrives at work to find the gallery gone&mdash;the space stripped bare as if it had never existed&mdash;and Drew Campbell&rsquo;s dead body on the floor. Overnight, Alice&rsquo;s dream job has vanished, and she finds herself at the center of police attention with nothing to prove her innocence. The phone number Drew gave her links back to a disposable phone.The artist whose work she displayed doesn&rsquo;t seem to exist. And the dead man she claims is Drew has been identified as someone else.When police discover ties between the gallery and a missing girl, Alice knows she&rsquo;s been set up. Now she has to prove it&mdash;a dangerous search for answers that will entangle her in a dark, high-tech criminal conspiracy and force her to unearth long-hidden secrets involving her own family&hellip; secrets that could cost Alice her life.Amazon Exclusive: Michael Connelly ReviewsLong GoneMichael Connelly&rsquo;s Edgar Award-winning first novel,The Black Echo, was published in 1992 and based in part on a true crime that had occurred in Los Angeles. Since then he has written more than 18 novels, the most recent of which isThe Fifth Witness.You know how the song goes--&ldquo;If I can make it here, I&rsquo;ll make it anywhere.&rdquo; The anthem for a city and a state of mind, powered by the voice of its own son, Frank Sinatra, even if technically he came from across the river.New York, New York. It is truly the first song on the soundtrack of the city. And it points up the risk and reward of living in the greatest city in the world.Well, what about the risks and rewards in writing a novel about the greatest city in the world? To me the challenge would be intimidating, even daunting, before I got the first word down on the first page. But not to Alafair Burke. WithLong Goneshe makes the city her own. She takes New York with a knowing and confident hand, folding its teeming streets into character and plot in a story that is never less than gripping.At center you have Alice Humphrey. She is the daughter of privilege in a city that doesn&rsquo;t pay much mind to that privilege. She&rsquo;s on her own and that is the beating heart of this book. Alice on her own. Burke constructs this book with the precision of a watchmaker. It is a contraption piece that closes tightly around Alice and then we are with her as she investigates the set up and finds her way to safety.I am familiar with most of Burke&rsquo;s work and I think Alice is her best heroine yet. She connects with us on so many levels. She is an everywoman cornered by forces she doesn&rsquo;t recognize or understand in a city with too many back alleys and secrets to ever know.  She is from a family that holds secrets from her as well as the world. But no matter. She is relentless in her pursuit of the truth, whichever way it is finally told. And in that we connect to her, admire her, like her. We feel for Alice Humphrey and want to be there when she sees it all through.That is the writer&rsquo;s most difficult task, building the bridge of empathy between reader and protagonist. Burke does it here with a character who is persistent in simply refusing to be a victim. Don&rsquo;t we all wish we were the same.Though any writer will flat out tell you that the easier it looks the harder it is to get on the page, Alafair Burke makes this one look like a walk in the park. Frank Sinatra would certainly be proud. Start spreading the news.",

Even more surprising than this quick turn of events is the revelation that it was never The Joker's intent to escape the vault-like facility, but instead to trap Batman there. Surrounded by an asylum full of dangerous criminals, many of which he put there and all at the beck and call of the Joker, can Batman survive and discover what is behind the Joker's intricate plot?GameplayInBatman: Arkham Asylumplayers strap on the gadget-heavy utility belt of the Caped Crusader. Gameplay here is a combination of both the knuckle crunching rush of hand to hand combat as you take on the hordes of thugs that infest Arkham Asylum, and stealth gameplay in which you must dispatch individuals from the shadows. Players can expect an engrossing single player campaign in which Batman continually moves forward to face the henchmen, bosses and traps that The Joker has set for him. With regards to opponents, in addition to The Joker who you will hear more than you see, the dark walls of Arkham also hold familiar villains from the the Batman criminal universe including Harley Quinn, Victor Zsasz and Killer Croc, that you will have to deal with, but don't expect a one-dimensional experience. As players progress from environment to environment within Arkham they will have to use varying combinations of muscle, detective skills, gadgetry and a certain degree of light RPG-like leveling of Batman's skills, arsenal and physical characteristics to survive and discover what The Joker's underlying scheme is.In addition to the story-driven single player campaignArkham Asylumalso contains various additional play modes. These include an arcade styled combat mode where players accumulate points by engaging hordes of thugs in a hand to hand slugfest across a series of maps, in which Batman's physical strength and agility play a major role. The key here is to chain together as many attacks as possible due to the fact that with each successful combo players increase the point multiplier associated with their actions. The game also features a time-based stealth mode where players must hone their ability to strike silently from the shadows. This gameplay, referred to as 'Invisible Predator' utilizes the Dark Knight's skill with gadgets like the grapple tool, batarang and explosives. These allow for vertical/horizontal mobility, the ability to quickly strike from above and at a distance and to take out enemies and create distractions, even through walls. But remember that Batman works solo and is not superhuman. Your enemies will congregate around trouble areas and work as a team against you, so you must be silent, plan your attacks wisely, strike quickly and discover the value of encouraging fear within enemies.Key FeaturesExperience the game in a whole new way with Game of the Year Edition extras including: Access to the playable Joker character (in the PS3 version only) and the Joker Challenge maps and 4 additional standard challenge maps.Utilize the unique FreeFlow combat system to chain together unlimited combos seamlessly and battle with huge groups of The Joker's henchmen in brutal melee brawls.Investigate as Batman, the world's greatest detective, by solving intricate puzzles with the help of cutting edge forensic tools including x-ray scanning, fingerprint scans, 'Amido Black' spray and a pheromone tracker.Face off against Gotham's greatest villains including The Joker, Harley Quinn, Victor Zsasz and Killer Croc.Become the Invisible Predator with Batman's fear takedowns and unique vantage point system to move without being seen and hunt enemies.Choose multiple takedown methods, including swooping from the sky and smashing through walls, and use the predator camera get a closer look at the action.Explore every inch of Arkham Asylum and roam freely on the infamous island, presented for the first time ever in its gritty and realistic entirety.Experience what it's like to be Batman using batarangs, explosive gel aerosol, the Batclaw, sonar resonator and the line launcher.Unlock more secrets by completing hidden challenges in the world and develop and customize equipment by earning experience points.Enjoy complete superhero freedom in the environment with the use of Batman's grapple to get to any place you can see, jump from any height and glide in any direction.",

The Lace Reader retains the strange magic of a vivid dream, though Barry's portrayal of modern-day Salem, Massachusetts--with its fascinating cast of eccentrics--is reportedly spot-on. Some of its stranger residents include generations of Whitney women, with a gift for seeing the future in the lace they make. Towner Whitney, back to Salem from self-imposed exile on the West Coast, has plans for recuperation that evaporate with her great-aunt Eva's mysterious drowning. Fighting fear from a traumatic adolescence she can barely remember, Towner digs in for answers. But questions compound with the disappearance of a young woman under the thrall of a local fire-and-brimstone preacher, whose history of violence against Whitney women makes the situation personal for Towner. Her role in cop John Rafferty's investigation sparks a tentative romance. And as they scramble to avert disaster, the past that had slipped through the gaps in Towner's memory explodes into the present with a violence that capsizes her concept of truth.

Since then we've had to content ourselves with the excellentUnreal Tournamentmultiplayer combat series. For this first true sequel Epic Games hired Legend Entertainment, who made a name for themselves with theUnreal: Return to Na Paliexpansion pack and the woefully underratedWheel of Timegame (based on the books by Robert Jordan). The result is fun and frantic, if a bit too short-lived.Unreal II's best feature is its lush graphics engine. It's state of the art. All the locations, which range from bizarre alien worlds to those based on the filmAlien, exude dynamic realism. Human and alien characters are well-animated and rendered, but have a cartoonish exaggeration that clashes with the realism of the architecture. The designers were undoubtedly shooting for a comic-book look, which explains why the women look like blow-up dolls with bare midriffs and the men have hulking muscles. The monsters, too, ripple with strength and menace. This style will please some, but is less effective than the more realistic styles employed by similar titles--although at least the art direction is consistent throughout the game.Unrealcast you as a prisoner who--through both good and bad luck--was freed from confinement, but marooned on an alien world. He goes on to become a sort of messiah figure to the four-armed natives, while other, scarier, natives want to kill him. It ends with a cliffhanger that this game does nothing to resolve. Now, you play as a new character who works for the Terran Colonial Authority. You're a space marshal on the ship Atlantis. You and your buxom partner, who looks more like an exotic dancer than a police woman, have to solve problems in a game only tenuously connected with the originalUnreal.Core gameplay and mission design are good, but uninspired. Legend has taken a conservative, almost minimalist approach. They've made a solid shooter that takes full advantage of Epic's state-of-the-art graphics engine, but did nothing to set the shooter apart from the crowd. One hopes thatUnreal II: The Awakeningawakens Epic to the fact thatUnrealis a genuinely interesting franchise that deserves more.--Andrew S.

        "0061655953": "Andrew Gross on Becoming a WriterI&rsquo;m often asked, how did you get into this trade, as my resume--an MBA from Columbia and sixteen years in the rag and sports apparel business--never exactly made a compelling case for the title:New York Timesbestselling author.But one of the great things about people writing thrillers today is that they come to their craft from disparate and compelling walks of life--lawyers, journalists, doctors, ad men, CIA operatives&mdash;and bring with them the experience of lives not spent in MFA programs and literary salons, but working amid the issues and crises that affectourworld every day.In 1996, I left my job as the head of a ski and golfwear company to take a flyer on a whim I had&mdash;well, more like an obsession. Like a million people, I had carried the lifelong urge to get out a story that was inside me, in my case a Manchurian Candidate-styled conspiracy novel calledHydraabout a political takeover of the country that featured a strong heroine. I begged my wife to grant me a year, a year without income, a year without knowing where this new path would take us, declaring I&rsquo;d earned it, deserved it. (She was a yoga teacher, so it wasn&rsquo;t too hard to get her to agree!) Of course, we both knew that writing&mdash;to say nothing of actually selling&mdash;a first novel is more difficult than you think. The year turned into two&mdash;and then three.I never thought I was being frivolous along the way. I always believed it would happen. I got some praise, and built on that, but I kept getting rejections too. Twenty-five of them from prospective agents.  Finally, one came on board. A high powered one. My first real validation!  With a ton of enthusiasmHydrawas pitched to two dozen publishers and two weeks later I had letters from all of them&mdash;all rejections again! Each seemed to contain some encouragement, but for each there was some element&mdash;the story was too political or too controversial&mdash;that got in the way. I was out of options.  I knew I would not be able to write a second one. I had a family to support. But in my heart I felt I had the chops. I had no idea what my next step in life would be.As I sat around, unsure and dismayed, I received a call&mdash;completely out of the blue, like a cheesy plot twist, except this one was real&mdash;from a woman who asked if I would take a call fromJames Patterson. Ahem!  I cleared my throat and paused a couple of seconds, so as not to convey the utter desperation my life was sinking under then, and answered, yeah, sure, I could fit him in!Thinking back twelve years, Jim wasn&rsquo;t quite the James Patterson we know now&mdash;where everything he publishes rockets straight to #1, the top selling thriller author in the country. He was a successful writer with a plan, looking to expand into multiple storylines, and one was about four dynamic women who form this bond, this koffee klatch of sorts, to share their life experiences and ultimately to solve crimes. Unbeknownst to me, my manuscriptHydrahad been handed to him by the head of his own publishing house (who originally elected to pass on it) with five words written on the cover: \"This guy does women well!!!\"  Jim read it, liked it, and most importantly,actedon it. He was looking to partner with someone. His call changed my writing life!Now maybe he had designs onThe Women's Murder Clubbecoming the second most successful crime series in fiction today (after his ownAlex Crossseries), but I didn&rsquo;t. I was just looking to scratch my way inside the circle that had been inaccessible so far, with a chance to pick up some tips from one of the best. A day later, we met for breakfast at a diner in White Plains. I bought into his vision for the characters and the story. I drove home and cranked out a couple of sample chapters and faxed them over...And the partnership lasted seven years!We did Women&rsquo;s Murder Club books set in San Francisco, a book set in the Middle Ages, one built around a Mafia trial I was a juror on, and one about art theft in Palm Beach. And when the time came for me to go out on my own, not only did I have a platform of readers who knew and hopefully loved the books we did together, and a bit of name recognition, but I felt schooled in Thriller Writing 401. I had an idea that eventually becameThe Blue Zone. It hit theNew York Timesbestseller list and sold in 23 countries. I&rsquo;ve followed that up with two other bestsellers,The Dark TideandDon&rsquo;t Look Twice.So a quick word about what I do now: I don&rsquo;t write Patterson-clones. Never intended to. But I do build on many of the techniques I learned with him, elements that I think any author can profit from, regardless of their literary ambition. Short, dramatic chapters that end on a punch and link to the one that follows. Investing your reader in the hero&rsquo;s plight within the first ten pages. Lots of twists and surprises. Start with a bang.My new thrillerRecklessbegins this way: a harrowing home break-in gone heartbreakingly wrong, leading to the suspicious deaths of larger-than-life Wall Street managers, a wealthy divorcee&rsquo;s fears that her new love is not the person he appears to be, and ultimately, to a gripping conspiracy that gives new meaning to the phrase &ldquo;too big to fail.&rdquo;  The events in it are current and happening, but it has characters you will recognize and feel you know well, and a breakneck ending you will not see coming.So I always think-- how different my life would have been if my draft ofHydrahad sold. I&rsquo;d probably be back in the apparel business now!A Q&amp;A with Andrew GrossHow did you get the idea forReckless?Like all my books, it's never one idea but a series of elements that knit together into a story line. In 2007, a horrible triple murder took place in Cheshire, Connecticut, where a an affluent surgeon's family was tortured and killed right in their country home, and it sent a chill through me and many people I know&mdash;not just the depravity of it, but the terrifying sense of violation and invasion for parents and kids who feel illusorily protected by their successful lives. That this sort of tragedy could never find their way to their door.Around a year later I was flying home from a weekend in Florida when a friend, who happened to be on the plane and sitting a row behind me, leaned forward and said&mdash;\"Bear Stearns just collapsed.\"To me, these words contained a similar profound historical importance as watching the trade towers come down, or the dismantling of the Berlin wall. A tsunami of events greater than society&rsquo;s ability to restrain it.  Something unimaginable happening before my eyes. I wanted to write a book about the sinister aspects of Wall Street as it connects to our government balanced against the personal stories of people who feel trapped and victim to events beyond their control&mdash;events they might have had a hand in making. So I combined the two events&mdash;one tragic, one stunning, the personal with the sensational, and that&rsquo;s howRecklesswas born.How has Ty Hauck&rsquo;s character changed over the past few books? What other changes do you foresee for him?Well, when I first wrote him I had no idea he&rsquo;d be with us for a while&mdash;three books. I will take a brief vacation from him on the next. What I love about Ty is that at heart he's a true romantic with his feet in the real world. He's a white knight, a true soul, in a world of questionable motives, who sees life in a simple, moral way and is willing to put himself at great risk and go up against the hegemonies of power and force that are way beyond his reach at first to penetrate or to dig out the truth. And usually it&rsquo;s a kind of \"quest\" or \"labor\" for a woman he loves. In this shifting and usually disappointing world, he is someone who doesn&rsquo;t disappoint, who you can count on to do the right thing. To me, that is very much at the heart of what being a hero in today&rsquo;s world means.Recklessis your fourth solo novel. What changes have you undergone as a writer from your first forays into fiction to this book?Well, my chapters have gotten a shade longer. But not too much so, I always fight my urges to let more texture in the books, let scenes develop more gradually with the commitment that I owe my readers a fast and gripping read. I think there is a deeper sense of personal motive in my books now than before. They&rsquo;re richer. I don&rsquo;t want to do things just for speed&mdash;as I did with Patterson or perhaps even inThe Blue Zone, which of course, has a great father/daughter dynamic which is about as \"textured\" as you can get. I&rsquo;ve pushed back against the melodramatic more&mdash;but then again&mdash;a little melodrama is always good, critics aside. I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m stumbling. Always hate to try and define my own work. It&rsquo;s better left to others to decide.Why do you write thrillers?I like to write books which engage readers with a sense of real life characters thrown into danger&mdash;I like the speed of film and the actions of heroes. And I guess I like the delivery of information in a manner that breeds suspense. So I guess I&rsquo;m a thriller guy. But I would like to write more of a generational, family story about the garment business, in the manner ofThe Godfather&mdash;if my publisher will let me one day.John Irving knows the last sentence of his novels and then works back to the beginning. What is your writing process?Well, I outline upfront. These days, about half the book, enough to get myself deep into the plot and the initial characters and to know what's at stake. And to get my publisher engaged with the next book. Then I always try to stay around ten chapters ahead of where I am. I&rsquo;m not a believer in the story leading me&mdash;mystery/thrillers have to be well thought out, like business strategies and puzzles, otherwise you can find yourself down some alleys you don&rsquo;t want to be. I want to control the story--frankly it&rsquo;s my mortgage that&rsquo;s at stake, not my characters'. But truth is, there are always changes and three a.m. epiphanies that completely change course. I may wake up and throw two people in bed together and say, \"it&rsquo;s time, get at it\"&mdash;or I may wake up and kill someone off who just the last night was safe. That&rsquo;s what happened with the mom inThe Blue Zone&mdash;I just woke up and said, \"sorry!!!\"What writers do you admire?Not necessarily in my genre: Cormac McCarthy for his extraordinary prose; Thomas Harris for his bad guys; Harlan Coben for his ordinary heroes; early Robert Stone for his complexity; Robert Wilson for his amazing African thrillers; Elmore Leonard for his dialogue and minor characters; James Lee Burke for his rich humanity; Patterson for how to move a story and for teaching me the trade. I&rsquo;m sure I&lsquo;m forgetting a few.Can you give readers an idea of what&rsquo;s coming next from the pen of Andrew Gross?We had a little tragedy in our family this past year. My twenty-one year old nephew committed suicide&mdash;jumped off a cliff. And as we writers do, we make sense of terrible events like this by weaving our own story around it, so I&rsquo;m going back to a family story&mdash;much like in the way ofThe Blue Zone&mdash;about a successful brother who has to solve his unsuccessful brother&rsquo;s only son&rsquo;s death. Should be a good one, I think. At least it&rsquo;s one that is good for me.",

She tries not to think about her mother&rsquo;s suicide (her last words to Lena were a forbidden &ldquo;I love you&rdquo;) or the supposed &ldquo;Invalid&rdquo; community made up of the uncured just beyond her Portland, Maine, border.

        "0061784796": "Amazon Exclusive: Q &amp; A with James RollinsQ:InBloodline, you introduce two new characters, Tucker and Kane, a pair unlike any your readers have seen before. Tell us about them, and why you decided to write about them?James Rollins:First of all, I wanted to honor these unique American heroes. Tucker Wayne is a former captain with the Army Rangers. After two tours of duty in Afghanistan, he leaves the service disillusioned after a bloody battle. Aided by members of his own unit, Tucker steals his war dog, Kane.What I liked best about exploring this pair's unique relationship is a phrase commonly used by military war dog handlers--It runs down the lead--describing how the emotions of the pair became shared over time, binding them together as firmly as any leash. And it's that bond and ability for the two to operate as one that I wanted to explore in this novel.Q:Can you tell us about your research into military dogs?JR:About a year and half ago, I was lucky enough to participate in a USO tour of authors to military bases in Iraq and Kuwait. There, I saw several of these war dogs in action. I was also able to meet and talk to a veterinary school classmate of mine who works with the veterinary corps out in Iraq. After that encounter, it got me thinking about writing this book, of honoring these unique war heroes on the page.Q:Women play a large role inBloodline. How are you able to write from the point of view of women so well?JR:I have three sisters who make sure I get those details correct, but also during my USO tour to Iraq and Kuwait, I got a chance to talk at length to women in the field--to hear what it's like to be a female in the armed services. And that'[s something I tried to capture accurately.Q:Your novels always delve into the cutting edge of science. What is the scientific basis behindBloodline?JR:The root of this book came from a recent article inTimemagazine. The cover declared:2045, the Year Man Becomes Immortal. I read that and wondered how that could become true. Could immortality be achievable in our lifetime? It sent me into a yearlong and chilling investigation into the frontiers of life extension.Q:What are some of these new discoveries involving immortality?JR:I've learned that there are actually two competing schools of study when it comes to the search for immortality. On one side, scientists are looking at moving man into machines, moving our consciousness into a synthetic arena. Scientists in Switzerland right now are working with IBM to create the firstvirtualhuman brain and say they are about a decade off from achieving this goal.On the other side of the scientific fence, researchers are also looking at moving machines into us: basically replacing our failing parts with artificial organs. We already have synthetic pancreases and mechanical hearts, and these scientific advancements continue to accelerate, especially with the explosive growth of nanotechnology, which involves engineering at the atomic level.Q:Now to the last and most pressing question: How close are we to achieving immortality?JR:That's a good question--and the answer is the most startling revelation I discovered while researching this story, something I share within the pages of this book. InBloodline, readers will learn a shocking scientific truth about the nature of mankind: That immortal beings already walk among us today.If you want to know who they are, if you want to learn how to live forever--readBloodline.",

On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, they say it would be suicide. Commander Shepard intends to prove them wrong.GameplayAn space-based action RPG like its predecessor, gameplay inMass Effect 2revolves around the player's particular version of Commander Shepard and continuing development of this character as the game proceeds. As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races, a more realistic damage system, a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage, a regenerative health system, a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard, and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. In doing this, the decisions that were made in the first game will affect the events of the second game.

On the other hand, new players coming to the series for the first time inMass Effect 2will start a brand-new character, discover the events of the previous games a they progress and embark on a thrilling stand-alone adventure that does not require the previous game for play.Key FeaturesFuturistic Weapons- Choose from 19 different weapons, including devastating heavy weapons that can end a battle in seconds.Elite Specialists- Recruit up to a dozen of the galaxy's most dangerous operatives to help you in your mission.

        "B00008J7NZ": "Halo 2is one of those rare video games that garnishes attention from regular folk who wouldn't know which direction to point a game controller. With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings",
        "0060540745": "Donald Zinkoff is one of the greatest kids you could ever hope to meet.  He laughs easily, he likes people, he loves school, he tries to rescue lost  girls in blizzards, he talks to old ladies. The only problem is, he's a loser.  Until fourth grade, Zinkoff's uncontrollable giggling in class, sloppy  handwriting, horrible flute playing, bad grades, clumsiness, and ineptitude at  sports go largely unnoticed. When he blows a race for his team, however, his  transition to loserdom is complete: \"[Loser] is the word. It is Zinkoff's new  name. It is not in the roll book.\" Fortunately, he doesn't really notice. As he  did inStargirl, Newbery  Medal-winning author Jerry Spinelli again explores the cruelty of a student body  and how it does and doesn't affect one student, pure of spirit. Presumably ifLosermakes one child view a \"different kid\" as a three-dimensional  character, Spinelli will consider his book successful.The author recounts Zinkoff's story--a case study of sorts--in short sentences  from a deliberately reportorial point of view, documenting the first years of  the boy's life and his evolution into a loser. What makes the book charming and  buoyant is that the reader, like Zinkoff's parents and his favorite teacher,  appreciates the boy's oblivious joie de vivre and his divine quirks. What is  less compelling about the novel is the \"let this be a lesson to us\"  heavy-handedness that accompanies the reportorial approach. Still, Spinelli  comes through again with a lively, often moving story with humor and heart to  spare.

This brought about the creation of Roxas, Sora&rsquo;s \"Nobody.\" Yet Roxas has no recollection of his previous life, which is unusual for a Nobody. He joins Organization XIII and slowly begins to discover the truth behind his existence and the Organization itself. As time passes he meets and befriends the fourteenth member of the Organization, who also has no recollection of her past. It is a strange coincidence. What will Roxas see during his time in the Organization? What is the connection between him, Sora, and the fourteenth member? And what becomes of them? Dive into the heart of theKingdom Heartsstoryline&rsquo;s biggest secrets.Panel SystemKingdom Hearts 358/2 Dayscontains a new gameplay mechanic referred to as the \"Panel System.\" These panels serve as a means to equip and customize character's levels, items, magic, weapons, abilities, armor and accessories. But more than just a means of access, panels also facilitate progression through the game in that certain items, spells, etc. necessary for progression cannot be used, or at least used to their full potential, until their panels are equipped. Once done though, not only can these be used, in many cases through the use of \"Link Panels\", which can be used in conjunction with other panels, thus allowing for special item and ability creation.MultiplayerNot only doesKingdom Hearts 358/2 Daysallow for team-based gameplay utilizing the franchises standard AI partners functionality, it also contains exciting cooperative and competitive multiplayer options. In both these options players can join together with additional players in DS multi-card play over a DS Wi-Fi connection. The cooperative mode is the real showcase option though, allowing players to team up with up to three friends and engage in mission play that is distinct from the story driven mode of the single player campaign. During these battles players choose from one of the fourteen members of Organization XIII, each wielding different weapons, skills, and stats. The multiplayer campaign also features hidden characters including favorite characters from theKingdom Heartsand Disney universe including Sora, Donald, Goofy, King Mickey and Riku.In addition, although dialog between characters and player inKingdom Hearts 358/2is limited to text, within multiplayer modes players will have access to a chat system for communication which displays responses on a single screen, allowing for complete exchanges and conversations between players in context.Key FeaturesFamiliar action-packedKingdom Heartsgameplay that has captivated fans worldwide.The brand new \"Panel System\" that allows you to customize Roxas&rsquo; arsenal by placing abilities, items, and weapon parts into allotted slots.Learn about the origins of the \"Organization XIII\" name.A series-first multiplayer mode, allowing up to 4 players to control any Organization XIII member.Additional unlockable characters in multiplayer modes, including: Sora, Donald, Goofy, King Mickey and Riku.Get to know the members of Organization XIII, including the mysterious fourteenth member.Finally experience theKingdom Heartsstoryline&rsquo;s missing chapter.",

No one from Arclight has survived an encounter with the Fade, except one teenage girl: Marina. Marina has no memory of her life before Arclight, and she is filled with guilt over the people who died attempting to rescue her, particularly the father of an enigmatic young man, Tobin. After it becomes clear that Marina has a strong but inexplicable connection to the Fade, she and Tobin enter dangerous dark territory to discover the truth. Told in the present tense, the episodic story relies on occasionally contrived dialogue to fill in past events that Marina cannot remember, and readers may grow frustrated as they must wait, along with Marina, to gradually understand how events connect. Nevertheless, an ever-popular romantic triangle and the promised revelation of secrets will propel fans of dystopian literature through this debut novel. Grades 7-10. --Diane Colson",

The first is that although he was assured that he was absolved of mortal sins committed in the form of wartime atrocities in the name of the churches interests in the Holy Land, that is not actually the case and his immortal soul is in grave peril. The second and more terrible is that his beloved Beatrice has been murdered, and her soul pulled down into hell by a dark force. Vowing not to accept the damnation of either souls, he gives chase, vows to get Beatrice back and descends into the infamous nine circles of hell.

Constable Barbara Havers face their most challenging and perilous case yet&mdash;the linked murders of four youths, three of black or mixed parentage&mdash;in bestseller George's absorbing 13th British police procedural (after 2003'sA Place of Hiding). Crime fans will find plenty of forensic minutiae and details of police bureaucracy and politics, but it's characterization at which George really excels. The up-and-down career of Havers is at low ebb following her demotion from sergeant to constable, and her rocky personal life doesn't make that easier to bear. Lynley's professional life has become more difficult due to the continued absence of Supt. Malcolm Webberly and the need to deal directly with Asst. Commissioner David Hillier. The tension builds as the brutal serial killings continue and the pressure to solve them mounts. George expertly uses every device in the book from red herrings to blind alleys, from subtle twists to swift shocks.

Even companies committed to \"jabbing\"&#8212;creating content for consumers and engaging with customers to build relationships&#8212;still desperately want to land the powerful, bruising swing that will knock out their opponents or their customers' resistance in one tooth-shattering, killer blow. Right hooks, after all, convert traffic to sales. They easily show results and return on investment. Except when they don't.In the same passionate, streetwise style his readers have come to expect, Vaynerchuk is on a mission to strengthen marketers' right hooks by changing the way they fight to make their consumers happy, and ultimately to compete. Thanks to the massive change in and proliferation of social media platforms in the last four years, the winning combination of jabs and right hooks is different now. Communication is still key, but context matters more than ever. It's not just about developing high-quality content; it's also about developing high-quality content that's perfectly adapted to specific social media platforms and mobile devices. It's about truly engaging with customers, not by shouting at them over social media but by using new narrative forms particular to each different media platform&#8212;especially, though not exclusively, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Twitter, and Tumblr.Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hookis a blueprint to social media marketing strategies that really work.",
        "0062200577": "*Starred Review* In Heart-Shaped Box (2007) and Horns (2010), Hill showed hints of an enlarging literary toolbox. With this 700-page opus, the tool set is complete, and Hill has indeed built something very big. The story follows Vic, from 8-year-old girl to troubled teen to embattled mother, as she struggles to survive as a &#x201C;strong creative&#x201D;&#x2014;one who has access (in her case, via a ramshackle bridge) to an alternate universe constructed from imagination. Problem is, a chief attraction of this other America is Christmasland, a snowy Neverland carnival controlled by cheery, ageless child-abductor Charlie Manx (think Bentley Little&#x2019;s Mailman or Stephen King&#x2019;s Pennywise). Manx tries to take Vic to Christmasland as a kid, and years later, in the book&#x2019;s central conflict, he tries to take her son. Hill doesn&#x2019;t spend much time in reality before careening deliriously off into a la-la land of horrifying absurdism (a bottomless Scrabble bag, a mouth full of fish-hook teeth). This engenders inelegance; at times, the parts are more than the whole. But Hill is omnivorous in his appetite for story and character, and here he has created his best: Lou, Vic&#x2019;s obese, warm-hearted lover; Bing, Manx&#x2019;s demented chief elf; and gutsy, heartbreaking Vic. Occasional drawings by Hill&#x2019;s Locke &amp; Key conspirator, Gabriel Rodriguez, add one more element to this vast and gangly but undeniably readable work.

Those new to Nintendo's enormously popularZeldaseries will be glad to know this game stands completely on its own. Our hero, Link, starts the game as a young boy living in a magical forest village populated by elf-like children. But there is evil lurking in the world. Strange monsters are appearing, and the land is changing. It's up to Link to discover why, defeat the monsters, and stop the evil at its source.The game world's ever-changing environment looks like a fairy tale come to life. Majestic waterfalls, towering castles, and magical forests are a feast for the eyes and ears. Rivers flow, rain falls, the sun and moon rise and set. There's even an erupting volcano! Exploring this world is half the fun of the game. Along the way, you learn musical tunes that you can play on the flute-like Ocarina, a magical device that helps you teleport, alter the weather, even control time itself.Character interaction is important to gather clues. The fairy princesses, singing frogs, and dragons you'll meet can be cute, humorous, or somewhat terrifying. Sprinkled liberally throughout the game are hundreds of secret treasures and enjoyable minigames (one of which, the fishing game, would almost be worth buying by itself). Game controls are easy to learn. There's even an elaborate fight training course built right into the game. Controlling the hero quickly becomes instinctive, and you can concentrate on saving the world. To win the game, you'll have to use not only Link's sword, but your mind as well. This game's challenging and inventive puzzles really make you think. In fact, to keep from getting stuck, it's worth spending a few bucks on anofficial player's guide.

        "B00012BSJ4": "When people ask me what my favorite game of all time is, I always answer the same thing:Metroid. Sure,Super Metroidon SNES took the concept and made it better, andMetroid Fusionwas a fantastic follow-up on the Game Boy Advance, but when push comes to shove the original is where my vote will always go. Then there'sMetroid Prime&#8230;but that's 3D and a story for a different day. This game and this story are all about the glory of 2D gaming.So you can only begin to imagine my excitement when Nintendo's newestMetroidredo appeared on my desk. For those of you that may not know,Zero Missionis a special edition of sorts. It's the originalMetroidwith spruced-up graphics, streamlined level designs and gameplay, plus a whole new chapter.At it's core, it is most definitely the originalMetroid, but as you travel around the world you start to notice differences. Hallways are changed, statues lead you to the next objective, and abilities like Power Grip and Space Jump that never existed in the original iteration pop up in time.Nintendo has been very hush-hush about this title since its announcement, and after playing through the game myself, I must admit I'm a little reluctant to give away too much, but I can give you some interesting facts to whet your whistle. The biggest chunk of new content takes place after you beat Mother Brain (which was where the original ended). Not only is this new zone fairly large (I would say it's bigger than Norfair and Brinstar combined) it incorporates a number of story elements that help tie the whole series together (includingMetroid Prime).In total, the game is still rather short. I beat it in roughly six and a half hours, and I wandered around a lot. But the new content is spectacular, and fans of the series will absolutely adore this special edition. And if you have never experiencedMetroid, then you are in for a treat. My one rip on this title is the fact that the game now holds your hand a little too much, so the title loses some of the wonder and puzzle solving that I loved about the original. But don't let this one setback stop you from picking up one of the greatest titles in the history of gaming.Concept:Update a classic with new graphics and lots of bonus materialGraphics:Crisp 2D sprites jump off your SP or GBA PlayerSound:Fantastic from beginning to endPlayability:Metroid's control set-up is still one of the most simple, yet complex schemes ever created &#8211; brilliantEntertainment:Replaying the original with added content is an 8-bit gamers dream come trueReplay:ModerateRated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Andy McNamaraIssue:February 20042nd Opinion:Much like the extended editions of The Lord of the Rings movies, Nintendo has reworked the originalMetroidto feature bonus content that ties into Samus' continuing adventures. I can't even begin to tell you how amazing this new material is. Let's just say that you're in for a big surprise after the Mother Brain fight. A huge surprise! I don't want to ruin the game for you, but I will say that there's a stretch of the game that I played with my jaw on the floor. Better yet, all of the original content has been extensively overhauled. The shape of the terrain has been altered dramatically, and as you progress through this incredible adventure you'll spot subtle changes every step of the way. With the original NES game included as a bonus, you'll get the chance to compare and contrast. Nintendo took one of the best games of all time and made it better.

        "0062109847": "The latest Jack Swyteck legal thriller begins with a controversial not-guilty verdict, a violent act that leaves a young woman in a coma, and accusations of corruption leveled at Jack himself. His client, a woman accused of murdering her daughter because the girl impinged on her carefree lifestyle, is acquitted, but Jack knows there&#x2019;s a lot more to the case than he&#x2019;s been allowed to reveal in court. And after a woman who looks startlingly like his client is beaten nearly to death, Jack discovers that this was no weirdly coincidental act of violence but rather a result of something hidden behind the media spectacle surrounding the trial. After a few lethargic Swyteck novels, the author charged back in 2011 with Afraid of the Dark, and this one is similarly energetic, with a story that&#x2019;s full of twists and turns and, not incidentally, some well-aimed criticisms of the way high-profile trials are covered by the news media. A timely and very well executed story. --David Pitt",
        "0060799250": "Any memoir based on the scandal of the moment must begin with a bang, and Frey's account of her relationship with Scott Peterson certainly does. The first seven pages race breathlessly through that first evening in November 2002 when she met Peterson on a blind date: flirting with him over dinner, splurging on gin & tonics, singing some tipsy karaoke duets and returning to Peterson's hotel for what she acknowledged the next day \"felt like a one-night stand.\" Frey then proceeds to tell the story that is doubtless familiar to throngs of gossip hounds. She describes how Peterson seduced her with his charm, charisma and apparently paternal feelings towards her young daughter. Frey also details her growing suspicions about her mysterious new boyfriend, fears that were realized when a friend finally connected the dots for her and Frey learned that Peterson was in fact married, that his pregnant wife was missing and that he was the prime suspect in the case. From there, it was just a short step to becoming a police informant and, ultimately, the key witness against Peterson at his double murder trial. Frey includes all the sordid highlights: secret tape recordings, TV makeovers, nude photographs, personal betrayals, and, always, the merciless hounding of the press. Frey portrays herself as an honest, decent young woman (the book is liberally sprinkled with Bible quotations) caught up in the whirlwind of a real-life melodrama. As forgettable as it was inevitable, mercifully short on biographical background, Frey's memoir delivers all the behind-the-scenes details that readers will want as the players in the Peterson saga quit the public stage.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0061438456": "Frank (Sullivan's Island) creates a world in which aspiring writer Beth Hayes, whose chirpy internal monologues and quiet uncertainties make her easily endearing, is as much a character as the house she lives in. After graduating from college in Boston, Beth returns to the South to spend a year house-sitting her family's home, Island Gamble, while her mother, Susan, visits Paris. Frank's portrayal of a large and complicated family is humorous and precise: there's Susan, adoring and kind; Aunt Maggie, a stickler for manners; twin aunts Sophie and Allison, who run an exercise-and-vitamin empire; and uncles Timmy and Henry, the latter of whom has ties to Beth's trust fund. Frank's lovable characters occasionally stymie her pace; there's almost no room left for Beth's friends or her love affairs with sleazy Max Mitchell and cherubic Woody Morrison, though these become important later on. Frank is frequently funny, and she weaves in a dark undercurrent that incites some surprising late-book developments. Tight storytelling, winsomely oddball characters and touches of Southern magic make this a winner.(July)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0060584009": "\"Just because I know how to change a guy's oil doesn't mean I want to spend the rest of my life on my back, staring up his undercarriage.\" From the word go, Evanovich delivers her usual goods, albeit in a different vehicle. After 10 Stephanie Plum novels, each more successful than the last, Evanovich introduces Alexandra Barnaby, aka Barney. Barney hails from Baltimore rather than New Jersey, but she's from the same slice of working-class life as Stephanie; she donned mechanic's overalls in her father's garage during summer breaks from college. Her younger brother, Wild Bill, shares her passion for cars, and now he's disappeared from Miami, along with NASCAR star Sam Hooker's boat, theHappy Hooker. Evanovich doesn't mind showing her romance roots, as Barney and Sam start off snarling at each other; as any reader can tell, they have to team up (a) to save Bill and (b) to enjoy delicious sex. As in the Plum books, plot takes a back seat to riffs, roughups and dialogue&mdash;and in the last lies the book's most notable distinction. If Stephanie bids fair to be New Jersey's Dorothy Parker, Barney is Baltimore's echo of Robert Parker. Conversation is terse and coded, full of sexual innuendo, with a high premium on toss-away lines uttered under duress. Despite the amazing quantity of physical jeopardy, there's little tension; it's all about hanging out with Metro Girl and NASCAR Guy&mdash;which may be just what millions of Evanovich fans will want.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0061744654": "A veteran chronicler of the mafiosi, Carlo (The Ice Man) turns his attention to Tommy Karate Pitera, a brutal capo in the Bonanno crime family who allegedly killed 60 people. Carlo traces the rise of Pitera, born in 1954 into a modest Brooklyn family, to an honored place with the Bonannos, whose reputation for widespread drug peddling and bloody rubouts struck fear in their rivals. After spending two years in Japan, Pitera returned home with mastery in martial arts, efficiency in killing and a love for drama, often dressing as a rabbi, a woman or in other wacky disguises to score a hit. The other fascinating character of this gangster saga is Jim Hunt, a tough DEA officer, who assembles a dragnet of smart methods, snitches and turncoats, and snares Pitera and his crew after several savage murders.

        "0062220756": "A seemingly incongruous choice of subject matter for author Greenberg, well-known ESPN anchor, All You Could Ask For examines the lives of three well-to-do women from Greenwich, Connecticut. Part 1 of the novel introduces us to Brooke, the young mother still very much in love with her husband; Samantha, the newlywed shocked to discover evidence of her husband&#x2019;s infidelity while they&#x2019;re on their Hawaiian honeymoon; and Katherine, the powerful banking executive who still works for the man who broke her heart years ago. Part 2 goes on to reveal how the women come to know one another and how their lives change for the better through shared friendships. Although the novel comes off, at times, as manufactured and cloying, Greenberg&#x2019;s heart is in the right place. The shared adversity these women face is portrayed realistically and tenderly, although a storybook ending ties up the individual stories a little too neatly. The three women are well drawn, and Greenberg displays an admirable ear for realistic dialogue. Fans of Deborah Copaken Konan, Sarah Pekkanen, and contemporary ensemble fiction will enjoy this debut novel. --Stephanie Turza",

When, despite his tenuous condition, an envious supervisor assigns him to a traumatic case involving the murder of an army colonel and a young captain as the prime suspect, Rutledge must gather all of his strength to not only solve the case, but fight the town people's prejudice against military personnel. To make matters worse, the prime witness is another veteran--on the brink of insanity--scorned by the villagers for what they perceive to have been less than honorable conduct during his tour of duty.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",
        "0099555352": "A massacre in the remote Swedish village of Hesj&ouml;vallen propels this complex, if diffuse, stand-alone thriller from Mankell (The Pyramid). Judge Birgitta Roslin, whose mother grew up in the village, comes across diaries from the house of one of the 19 mostly elderly victims kept by Jan Andr&eacute;n, an immigrant ancestor of Roslin's. The diaries cover Andr&eacute;n's time as a foreman on the building of the transcontinental railroad in the United States. An extended flashback charts the journey of a railroad worker, San, who was kidnapped in China and shipped to America in 1863. After finding evidence linking a mysterious Chinese man to the Hesj&ouml;vallen murders, Roslin travels to Beijing, suspecting that the motive for the horrific crime is rooted in the past. While each section, ranging in setting from the bleak frozen landscape of northern Sweden to modern-day China bursting onto the global playing field, compels, the parts don't add up to a fully satisfying whole.Author tour.

        "B00005QEFF": "Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

        "0061827010": "The pseudonymous Boyd, a former FBI agent, fails to bring much convincing insider information to his debut, a routine thriller. FBI deputy assistant director Kate Bannon tracks down Steve Vail, a maverick FBI agent who left the bureau for a new life as a Chicago bricklayer, because she needs Vail's help in apprehending a criminal gang, the Rubaco Pentad, with a grudge against the FBI. The Pentad follows up the murder of L.A. reporter Connie Lysander, who wrote a story critical of the FBI, with ever-increasing demands for money from the bureau to forestall future killings and the setting of sophisticated death traps. When an agent disappears while making a payoff to the gang, he becomes a prime suspect, despite Vail's reservations. Predictable plot elements include the hero's incredible escapes from peril and the growing romantic bond between the laconic Vail and the attractive Bannon.

        "0060972777": "Fiction writer Tobias Wolff electrified critics with his scarifying 1989 memoir, which many deemed as notable for its artful structure and finely wrought prose as for the events it describes. The story is pretty grim: Teenaged Wolff moves with his divorced mother from Florida to Utah to Washington State to escape her violent boyfriend. When she remarries, Wolff finds himself in a bitter battle of wills with his abusive stepfather, a contest in which the two prove to be more evenly matched than might have been supposed. Deception, disguise, and illusion are the weapons the young man learns to employ as he grows up--not bad training for a writer-to-be. Somber though this tale of family strife is, it is also darkly funny and so artistically satisfying that most readers come away exhilarated rather than depressed.",
        "0060734000": "Cole Matthews is angry. Angry, defiant, smug--in short, a bully. His  anger has taken him too far this time, though. After beating up a ninth-grade  classmate to the point of brain damage, Cole is facing a prison sentence. But  then a Tlingit Indian parole officer named Garvey enters his life, offering an  alternative called Circle Justice, based on Native American traditions, in which  victim, offender, and community all work together to find a healing solution.  Privately, Cole sneers at the concept, but he's no fool--if it gets him out of  prison, he'll do anything. Ultimately, Cole ends up banished for one year to a  remote Alaskan island, where his arrogance sets him directly in the path of a  mysterious, legendary white bear. Mauled almost to death, Cole awaits his fate  and begins the transition from anger to humility.Ben Mikaelsen's depiction of a juvenile delinquent's metamorphosis into a  caring, thinking individual is exciting and fascinating, if at times  heavy-handed. Cole's nastiness and the vivid depictions of the lengths he must  go to survive after the (equally vivid) attack by the bear are excruciating at  times, but the concept of finding a way to heal a whole community when one  individual wrongs another is compelling. The jacket cover photo of the author in  a bear hug with the 700-pound black bear that he and his wife adopted and raised  is definitely worth seeing!

Levi, then a 25-year-old chemist, spent 10 months in the camp. Even Levi's most graphic descriptions of the horrors he witnessed and endured there are marked by a restraint and wit that not only gives readers access to his experience, but confronts them with it in stark ethical and emotional terms: &quot;[A]t dawn the barbed wire was full of children's washing hung out in the wind to dry. Nor did they forget the diapers, the toys, the cushions and the hundred other small things which mothers remember and which children always need. Would you not do the same?

        "0060739479": "Told in the form of a recollection, these \"confessions\" cover 13-year-old Charlotte's eventful 1832 transatlantic crossing. She begins her trip a prim schoolgirl returning home to her American family from England. From the start, there is something wrong with the Seahawk : the families that were to serve as Charlotte's chaperones do not arrive, and the unsavory crew warns her not to make the trip. When the crew rebels, Charlotte first sides with the civilized Captain Jaggerty, but before long she realizes that he is a sadist and--the only female aboard--she joins the crew as a seaman. Charlotte is charged with murder and sentenced to be hanged before the trip is over, but ends up in command of the Seahawk by the time it reaches its destination. Charlotte's repressive Puritanical family refuses to believe her tale, and the girl returns to the sea. Charlotte's story is a gem of nautical adventure, and Avi's control of tone calls to mind William Golding's 1980s trilogy of historical novels of the sea. Never wavering from its 19th century setting, the novel offers suspense and entertainment modern-day readers will enjoy.

        "B00005Q8M4": "It's often argued that Nintendo makes the best video games in the world,  but one thing the company isn't known for is scary games. If you thoughtLuigi's Mansionwas  frightening, then quite frankly you've led a sheltered life.Eternal  Darkness: Sanity's Requiem, however, is the real deal: it's scary, it's  gory, and it's really nothing likeResident Evilat all.The game starts when you find out your grandfather has had his clogs popped by  some unspeakable monster. While rummaging through his stuff (alone, at night, in  his huge mansion) you come across a jolly little hardback calledThe Tome of  Eternal Darkness, and upon reading it you suddenly find yourself controlling  a Roman centurion in 26 B.C. Persia. And this is how the game continues--you  find and read a passage of the book in the mansion and then control a series of  11 completely different characters over the course of two millennia.Apart from the innovative structure of the game, the other big selling points ofEternal Darknessare its sanity effects--every time you see a monster and  fail to kill it your sanity level will drop. If it drops too far, you start  seeing things: flies walking along the inside of your screen, messages telling  you your controller is unplugged when it clearly isn't, and all sorts of other  clever freakery.The game's not perfect, though; the combat is a little too fiddly, and it's  still not quite as scary asSilent Hill, butEternal Darknessis  an unusual and rewarding title that should finally shut up those annoying twerps  that insist Nintendo only makes games for kids.--David Jenkins--Amazon.co.uk",

        "006009026X": "ABC News political commentator and NPR news analyst Roberts didn't intend this as a general history of women's lives in early America-she just wanted to collect some great \"stories of the women who influenced the Founding Fathers.\" For while we know the names of at least some of these women (Martha Washington, Abigail Adams, Eliza Pinckney), we know little about their roles in the Revolutionary War, the writing of the Constitution, or the politics of our early republic. In rough chronological order, Roberts introduces a variety of women, mostly wives, sisters or mothers of key men, exploring how they used their wit, wealth or connections to influence the men who made policy. As high-profile players married into each other's families, as wives died in childbirth and husbands remarried, it seems as if early America-or at least its upper crust-was indeed a very small world. Roberts's style is delightfully intimate and confiding: on the debate over Mrs. Benedict Arnold's infamy, she proclaims, \"Peggy was in it from the beginning.\" Roberts also has an ear for juicy quotes; she recounts Aaron Burr's mother, Esther, bemoaning that when talking to a man with \"mean thoughts of women,\" her tongue \"hangs pretty loose,\" so she \"talked him quite silent.\" In addition to telling wonderful stories, Roberts also presents a very readable, serviceable account of politics-male and female-in early America.

        "0099464462": "This highly original first novel won the largest advance San Francisco-based MacAdam/Cage had ever paid, and it was money well spent. Niffenegger has written a soaring love story illuminated by dozens of finely observed details and scenes, and one that skates nimbly around a huge conundrum at the heart of the book: Henry De Tamble, a rather dashing librarian at the famous Newberry Library in Chicago, finds himself unavoidably whisked around in time. He disappears from a scene in, say, 1998 to find himself suddenly, usually without his clothes, which mysteriously disappear in transit, at an entirely different place 10 years earlier-or later. During one of these migrations, he drops in on beautiful teenage Clare Abshire, an heiress in a large house on the nearby Michigan peninsula, and a lifelong passion is born. The problem is that while Henry's age darts back and forth according to his location in time, Clare's moves forward in the normal manner, so the pair are often out of sync. But such is the author's tenderness with the characters, and the determinedly ungimmicky way in which she writes of their predicament [...] that the book is much more love story than fantasy. It also has a splendidly drawn cast, from Henry's violinist father [...] to Clare's odd family and a multitude of Chicago bohemian friends. [...] It is a fair tribute to her skill and sensibility to say that the book leaves a reader with an impression of life's riches and strangeness rather than of easy thrills.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

Borrowing a convention from mystery novels, Moriarty opens with a prologue whose events must be explained through subsequent chapters: in this case, what led one sis to imbed a fondue fork in another sis's pregnant belly at their 34th birthday celebration dinner? Moriarty gleefully describes the triplets' turbulent previous year, which forces them to abandon the roles they've played since childhood. Sarcastic and abrasive marketing executive Cat must grapple with her husband Dan's affair, a miscarriage and a drinking problem, while flighty Gemma, a full-time house sitter, probes her fears of commitment when she meets charming locksmith Charlie. Lyn, a successful entrepreneur, wife and mother, has perfected the art of time management (\"Sex with husband. Check\"), but she's quietly seized by bouts of panic. Despite such unoriginal problems, Moriarty's novel is a winning combination of smart-alecky fun and feel-good mush (mostly the former). Her writing is smart and playful (\"Death was the hot bath you promised yourself while you endured small talk and uncomfortable shoes\"), her characters are quirky and lovable and her clever plot turns&mdash;like the rekindled love between the triplets' divorced parents&mdash;are fun.

        "0060572140": "This memoir of Patchett's friendship withAutobiography of a Faceauthor Lucy Grealy shares many insights into the nature of devotion. One of the best instances of this concerns a fable of ants and grasshoppers. When winter came, the hard-working ant took the fun-loving grasshopper in, each understanding their roles were immutable. It was a symbiotic relationship. Like the grasshopper, Grealy, who died of cancer at age 39 in 2002, was an untethered creature, who liked nothing more than to dance, drink and fling herself into Patchett's arms like a kitten. Patchett (The Patron Saint of Liars;Bel Canto) tells this story chronologically, in bursts of dialogue, memory and snippets of Grealy's letters, moving from the unfolding of their deep connection in graduate school and into the more turbulent waters beyond. Patchett describes her attempts to be a writer, while Grealy endured a continuous round of operations as a result of her cancer. Later, when adulthood brought success, but also heartbreak and drug addiction, the duo continued to be intertwined, even though their link sometimes seemed to fray. This gorgeously written chronicle unfolds as an example of how friendships can contain more passion and affection than any in the romantic realm. And although Patchett unflinchingly describes the difficulties she and Grealy faced in the years after grad school, she never loses the feeling she had the first time Grealy sprang into her arms: \"[She] came through the door and it was there, huge and permanent and first.\"Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0061709719": "This scattered collection of rambling rants lauding Google's abilities to harness the power of the Internet Age generally misses the mark. Blog impresario Jarvis uses the company's success to trace aspects of the new customer-driven, user-generated, niche-market-oriented, customized and collaborative world. While his insights are stimulating, Jarvis's tone is acerbic and condescending; equally off-putting is his pervasive name-dropping. The book picks up in a section on media, where the author finally launches a fascinating discussion of how businesses&mdash;especially media and entertainment industries&mdash;can continue to evolve and profit by using Google's strategies. Unfortunately, Jarvis may have lost the reader by that point as his attempt to cover too many topics reads more like a series of frenzied blog posts than a manifesto for the Internet age.(Jan.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Since then, Jeth has been in the forced employ of an interstellar crime lord, aboard the Avalon. It is a ship specially designed by Jeth's parents to navigate and explore the Belgrave, a sector of space that gives off inexplicable power fluctuations; many consider it haunted. Jeth is finally given the opportunity to captain the Avalon when the crew are sent into the Belgrave to salvage a stranded Confederation ship said to hold a dangerous weapon.

        "0060393491": "Product DescriptionWally Lamb's two previous novels,She's Come UndoneandI Know This Much Is True, struck a chord with readers. They responded to the intensely introspective nature of the books, and to their lively narrative styles and biting humor. One critic called Wally Lamb a \"modern-day Dostoyevsky,\" whose characters struggle not only with their respective pasts, but with a \"mocking, sadistic God\" in whom they don't believe but to whom they turn, nevertheless, in times of trouble (New York Times).In his new novel,The Hour I First Believed, Lamb travels well beyond his earlier work and embodies in his fiction myth, psychology, family history stretching back many generations, and the questions of faith that lie at the heart of everyday life. The result is an extraordinary tour de force, at once a meditation on the human condition and an unflinching yet compassionate evocation of character.When forty-seven-year-old high school teacher Caelum Quirk and his younger wife, Maureen, a school nurse, move to Littleton, Colorado, they both get jobs at Columbine High School. In April 1999, Caelum returns home to Three Rivers, Connecticut, to be with his aunt who has just had a stroke. But Maureen finds herself in the school library at Columbine, cowering in a cabinet and expecting to be killed, as two vengeful students go on a carefully premeditated, murderous rampage. Miraculously she survives, but at a cost: she is unable to recover from the trauma. Caelum and Maureen flee Colorado and return to an illusion of safety at the Quirk family farm in Three Rivers. But the effects of chaos are not so easily put right, and further tragedy ensues.While Maureen fights to regain her sanity, Caelum discovers a cache of old diaries, letters, and newspaper clippings in an upstairs bedroom of his family's house. The colorful and intriguing story they recount spans five generations of Quirk family ancestors, from the Civil War era to Caelum's own troubled childhood. Piece by piece, Caelum reconstructs the lives of the women and men whose legacy he bears. Unimaginable secrets emerge; long-buried fear, anger, guilt, and grief rise to the surface.As Caelum grapples with unexpected and confounding revelations from the past, he also struggles to fashion a future out of the ashes of tragedy. His personal quest for meaning and faith becomes a mythic journey that is at the same time quintessentially contemporary&#8212;and American.The Hour I First Believedis a profound and heart-rending work of fiction. Wally Lamb proves himself a virtuoso storyteller, assembling a variety of voices and an ensemble of characters rich enough to evoke all of humanity.",

        "0062021877": "InBlindsighted(book one of an anticipated three featuring Grant  County, Georgia, pediatrician and coroner Dr. Sara Linton), first-time novelist  Karin Slaughter comes out swinging in true medical examiner fashion. That is to  say, covered with blood from the get-go.Without warning, the body jerked violently, pitching forward and slamming Sara  onto the floor. Blood spread out around both of them, and Sara instinctively  clawed to get out from under the convulsing woman. With her feet and hands she  groped for some kind of purchase on the slick bathroom floor. Finally, Sara  managed to slide out from underneath her. She turned Sibyl over, cradling her  head, trying to help her through the convulsions. Suddenly, the jerking stopped.Sibyl is, or was, Sibyl Adams, a college professor who had the misfortune of  being drugged, savagely raped, slashed, and left for dead in the toilet of the  local diner, to be coincidentally discovered by Sara Linton. Coincidences don't  stop there, and neither do the rapes and murders. The next is, unimaginably,  still more gruesome than the first and it, too, is discovered by Dr. Linton.  Police Chief Jeffrey Tolliver is Sara's ex-husband, and mercurial detective Lena  Adams, another major player in the ensuing drama, was Sibyl's twin sister.And the monster behind these increasingly more depraved acts? Suspects abound,  from the diner's jack-of-all-trades, Will Harris, to Victim No. 2's boyfriend,  to Jack Allen Wright who, a dozen years prior, raped Dr. Linton (that rape had  been a secret until now). There are other possibilities, naturally, and it soon  becomes apparent that Sara's an intended target.A graduate of the Patricia Cornwell school of mayhem and gore, Slaughter has  faithfully stitched together a fast, engaging, and diverting read complete with  a strong-yet-vulnerable heroine. Characters are nicely if somewhat obviously  drawn, the plot is inventive, and the narrative's pacing quickens the pulse  straight to the cliff-hanging denouement.

His son-in-law, Gerald Woodman, is a scam artist. Gerald's two sons, Neil and Stewart, gamble in Vegas and rub elbows with the mob. If you need the insurance money, is killing Mom and Dad such a stretch? The question is really this: Does a book about despicable people make good reading? Well, yeah, it does. The authors do a fine job of showing motivation and psychology. We also see good detective work as the police peel away onion layers of information to expose sordid facts. The title is perhaps a misnomer because it implies a strong religious connection, and religion doesn't play into these people's lives.

        "0060898771": "Book DescriptionTerrorist attacks. Natural disasters. Domestic crackdowns. Economic collapse. Riots. Wars. Disease. Starvation.What can you do when it all hits the fan?You can learn to be self-sufficient and survive without the system.**I've started to look at the world through apocalypse eyes.** So begins Neil Strauss's harrowing new book: his first full-length worksince the international bestsellerThe Game, and one of the most original-and provocative-narratives of the year.After the last few years of violence and terror, of ethnic and religious hatred, of tsunamis and hurricanes&ndash;and now of world financial meltdown&ndash;Strauss, like most of his generation, came to the sobering realization that, even in America, anything can happen. But rather than watch helplessly, he decided to do something about it. And so he spent three years traveling through a country that's lost its sense of safety, equipping himself with the tools necessary to save himself and his loved ones from an uncertain future.With the same quick wit and eye for cultural trends that markedThe Game, The Dirt,andHow to Make Love Like a Porn Star, Emergencytraces Neil's white-knuckled journey through today's heart of darkness, as he sets out to move his life offshore, test his skills in the wild, and remake himself as a gun-toting, plane-flying, government-defying survivor. It's a tale of paranoid fantasies and crippling doubts, of shady lawyers and dangerous cult leaders, of billionaire gun nuts and survivalist superheroes, of weirdos, heroes, and ordinary citizens going off the grid.It's one man's story of a dangerous world&ndash;and how to stay alive in it.Before the next disaster strikes, you're going to want to read this book. And you'll want to do everything it suggests. Because tomorrow doesn't come with a guarantee...Questions for Neil StraussAmazon.com:What initially inspired you to writeEmergency?Strauss:It happened over the last eight years, watching as everything that we thought could never happen in America suddenly started happening. So I decided to take control over my own life, rather than being dependent on an increasingly undependable system, and worked toward becoming as self-sufficient, independent, skilled, and experienced as I could. That journey continues today.Amazon.com:You use the term \"Fliesian\" in the book (as inLord of the Flies). What is a Fliesian?Strauss:Someone who believes that people, if put in a world where there are no consequences to their actions, will do horrible things.Amazon.com:So how can we hold on to our kindness and humaneness in a crisis?Strauss:Fortunately, in my experience, it is precisely these situations when you see the best in people come out. The worst in some tends to arise only when the resources one needs to survive are scarce and there is competition for them.Amazon.com:Do you think that this book is catering to a fear-based culture?Strauss:Actually, the book is less about spreading fears than getting over them. What most of us fear is the unknown, and we fret about what&#x2019;s going to happen in an uncertain future when we consider the calamities of the past. I decided to no longer react to the things I read in newspapers, but instead to understand them. So I took each worst-case scenario to the extreme, and experienced many of the things that used to make me anxious. I guess, in that way, it was like a more interesting, adventurous Prozac.Amazon.com:A lot of writers these days are basing books on various year-long stunts: read the encyclopedia for a year, always say \"yes\" for a year, have sex with your wife every day for a year. But your brand of immersion journalism, inEmergencyand inThe Game, is more open-ended--and more personal--than that. Do you draw any sort of line between the books and your life?Strauss:My books never begin as books. They usually begin as some sort of lack I recognize in my life and try to fix with the help of the most qualified experts I can find. Often, these people are not in the public eye, but hidden in a splinter subculture. And while I&#x2019;m trying to get taken under their wing, I realize at some point I&#x2019;m spending so much time trying to learn and improve that I might as well have something to show for it, so I write a book.Amazon.com:One of the first subcultures you embedded yourself in was a cabal of billionaires. Are wealthy people safer than the rest of us?Strauss:No, they&#x2019;re more scared than the rest of us. That&#x2019;s why they&#x2019;re taking so many precautionary measures. They are defined by their money, and now that identity is crumbling around them. You can&#x2019;t buy safety. Those who are the most safe are the ones with knowledge, skills, and experience.Amazon.com:You describe the philosophy of the sphincter inEmergency. What is that?Strauss:I learned that from one of my defense instructors. The basic idea is that, in a high-pressure situation, the first thing that happens is people get nervous and uptight. And as soon as your sphincter tightens, as the metaphor goes, it cuts off circulation to your brain. So one of the best survival skills you can have is the ability to quickly and coolly assess a situation rather than panicking and doing something stupid.Amazon.com:From your wilderness survival training, it sounds like you're in pretty good shape if things ever hit the fan. But what if you live in the city?Strauss:That&#x2019;s a good point. A lot of the wilderness survival skills I learned don&#x2019;t take into account that, in America today, there&#x2019;s little actual wilderness left. So I took a class called Urban Escape and Evasion. As the teacher put it, &#x201C;Once you learn lockpicking, the world is your oyster.&#x201D; He also taught car hot-wiring, evading pursuit vehicles, and, as an exam, handcuffed me, put me in a trunk, and told me I had to escape. It was one of the most interesting classes I&#x2019;d taken in my life. If I&#x2019;d known these skills in high school, I definitely would have been expelled.Amazon.com:The book has a surprising trajectory--surprising to the reader and I think to you as well. You start out looking for a way to get out of Dodge if one of many possible disasters strikes, but as you develop your survival skills, instead of becoming a lone wolf in the woods, you start becoming tied to your community, as an EMT and a trained crisis management worker (not to mention a goat midwife). It's actually pretty heartwarming. Did you see any of that coming?Strauss:Definitely not. I had no idea that when disasters happen now, instead of running away from them, I&#x2019;d be running toward them and trying to be of some use to the community.

        "0060766123": "After the seemingly never-ending media coverage of pregnant Laci Peterson's Christmas Eve 2002 disappearance and husband Scott's subsequent arrest, trial, conviction and death-penalty sentence for her murder, it's hard to believe anything about this notorious case could still be \"untold.\" But Court TV anchor Crier and co-author Thompson's encyclopedic tome includes never-before-released transcripts of conversations between Scott and others (which don't significantly impact one's understanding of the case, however) and a 38-page appendix of photos, documents and other police evidence. Although much of the information in this book has been reported previously or revealed at trial, anyone looking for a comprehensive overview of the case will find it here. The authors chart not only the police investigation and trial but the personal and family history of Scott and Laci. A more balanced examination of the case is all that's missing to make this book really stand out. Up front, Crier states that since the first days of the case, she felt certain that Scott was a sociopath responsible for his wife's disappearance, and throughout the book, she demonstrates how and why. Given Scott's behavior in the weeks prior to and immediately after Laci's disappearance, not to mention all the lies he told to police, family and friends, she's not exactly going out on a limb. Although few people would doubt Scott's guilt, the whole book is very pro-police-it's even dedicated \"To all those who protect and serve.\" Had the authors started from a presumption of innocence and turned a critical eye on the investigation, which yielded more circumstantial than solid forensic evidence, the book would have been more compelling, but its thoroughness will draw many readers nonetheless. 12 pages of color photos.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The control stick on the Nunchuk controls player movement (on stages that allow player movement), while aiming the Wii Zapper moves the targeting reticule on the screen. The Zapper comes withLink's Crossbow Training, which helps to familiarize the player with the Zapper in a shooting gallery style game.Link's Crossbow Trainingcontains three game styles: target shooting, defender and ranger.Features:Target Shooting: In target-shooting rounds, players shoot bull's-eyes as they pop up on the screen. In early stages, targets are stationary. As the game difficulty increases in later levels, the targets move. Hitting the center of the bull's-eye nets more points, and hitting targets in succession without missing earns combo multipliers. Link can aim anywhere on the screen.Defender: In defender rounds, players remain stationary but can look and aim in all directions by aiming off screen. Hordes of enemies assault Link, and he must fight them off. These battles have a great deal of variety, from fighting off skeletons in a desert to defending a wagon from boar-riding Bokoblins.Ranger: In ranger rounds, players can move throughout the level using the control stick and aim anywhere they want by aiming the Wii Zapper wherever they want to look. In these missions, Link storms enemy encampments, fights his way through a forest and seeks out his foes while exploring the environments.The Wii Remote and Nunchuk are sold separately",
        "0061988243": "[Signature]Reviewed byMarlon JamesOf the many pitfalls lurking for the historical novel, the most dangerous is history itself. The best writers either warp it for selfish purposes (Gore Vidal), dig for the untold, interior history (Toni Morrison), or both (Jeannette Winterson). Allende, four years afterInes of My Soul, returns with another historical novel, one that soaks up so much past life that there is nowhere left to go but where countless have been. Opening in Saint Domingue a few years before the Haitian revolution would tear it apart, the story has at its center Zarit&eacute;, a mulatto whose extraordinary life takes her from that blood-soaked island to dangerous and freewheeling New Orleans; from rural slave life to urban Creole life and a different kind of cruelty and adventure. Yet even in the new city, Zarit&eacute; can't quite free herself from the island, and the people alive and dead that have followed her.Zarit&eacute;'s passages are striking. More than merely lyrical, they map around rhythms and spirits, making her as much conduit as storyteller. One wishes there was more of her because, unlike Allende, Zarit&eacute; is under no mission to show us how much she knows. Every instance, a brush with a faith healer, for example, is an opportunity for Allende to showcase what she has learned about voodoo, medicine, European and Caribbean history, Napoleon, the Jamaican slave Boukman, and the legendary Mackandal, a runaway slave and master of black magic who has appeared in several novels including Alejo Carpentier'sKingdom of This World. The effect of such display of research is a novel that is as inert as a history textbook, much like, oddly enough John Updike'sTerrorist, a novel that revealed an author who studied a voluminous amount of facts without learning a single truth.Slavery as a subject in fiction is still a high-wire act, but one expects more from Allende. Too often she forgoes the restraint and empathy essential for such a topic and plunges into a heavy breathing prose reminiscent of the Falconhurst novels of the 1970s, but without the guilty pleasure of sexual taboo. Sex, overwritten and undercooked, is where opulent hips slithered like a knowing snake until she impaled herself upon his rock-hard member with a deep sigh of joy. Even the references to African spirituality seem skin-deep and perfunctory, revealing yet another writer too entranced by the myth of black cultural primitivism to see the brainpower behind it. WithInes of My Soulone had the sense that the author was trying to structure a story around facts, dates, incidents, and real people. Here it is the reverse, resulting in a book one second-guesses at every turn. Of course there will be a forbidden love. Betrayal. Incest. Heartbreak. Insanity. Violence. And in the end the island in the novel's title remains legend. Fittingly so, because to reach theIsland Beneath the Sea, one would have had to dive deep. Allende barely skims the surface.Marlon James's recent novel, The Book of Night Womenwas a finalist for the 2010 National Book Critics Circle Award.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0060781939": "If Shakespeare had written an 18th-century romantic comedy, it might look something like this novel. In her latest, veteran James offers a larger-than-life portrait of Georgian England, complete with oversexed aristocrats, posturing courtesans and a feuding duke and duchess. At the heart of it all is Roberta St. Giles, an ingenue who's intent on marrying the duke of Villiers, a chess player and notorious womanizer. Roberta, the daughter of the poetry-addicted Mad Marquess, wants nothing more than an unsentimental husband like Villiers. But in her quest to become the sort of woman who would attract the duke, she finds herself falling for Damon Reeve, her tutor in the art of pleasure. James embellishes her tale with a number of characters, each with their own desires, vices and schemes. At times, the profusion of people and plot threads overwhelms the primary romance. Roberta, in particular, pales next to the vivacious but unhappily married duchess of Beaumont, who begs for her own story. Despite this lack of focus, James pulls everything together in the final third, making for a colorful, spirited romance that will leave readers desperate for a sequel.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But 70 years later, as her great-granddaughter, Grace, is mourning her father&#x2019;s death, Maggie decides it&#x2019;s finally time to share her story. Inspired by the true tale of an Irish community that suffered the largest proportional loss in the sinking, the novel hits on the standard elements of the Titanic story&#x2014;the ship&#x2019;s magnificence, the stark differences between first and third classes, the many elements that contributed to its downfall. What makes Gaynor&#x2019;s novel fresh is the way she sets the tragedy in the context of her characters&#x2019; lives. Gaynor is a gentle storyteller who doesn&#x2019;t challenge the reader, writing prettily but at times predictably. At the same time, even the most avid Titanic buff is sure to find something new in this well-researched, finely detailed story. Just as Maggie&#x2019;s retelling makes the disaster real for her great-granddaughter, Gaynor brings immediacy to the oft-told story by shrinking it to a human scale. --Bridget Thoreson",

        "0061732370": "Product DescriptionThe life Kamila Sidiqi had known changed overnight when the Taliban seized control of the city of Kabul. After receiving a teaching degree during the civil war&mdash;a rare achievement for any Afghan woman&mdash;Kamila was subsequently banned from school and confined to her home. When her father and brother were forced to flee the city, Kamila became the sole breadwinner for her five siblings. Armed only with grit and determination, she picked up a needle and thread and created a thriving business of her own.The Dressmaker of Khair Khanatells the incredible true story of this unlikely entrepreneur who mobilized her community under the Taliban. Former ABC News reporter Gayle Tzemach Lemmon spent years on the ground reporting Kamila's story, and the result is an unusually intimate and unsanitized look at the daily lives of women in Afghanistan. These women are not victims; they are the glue that holds families together; they are the backbone and the heart of their nation.  Afghanistan's future remains uncertain as debates over withdrawal timelines dominate the news.The Dressmaker of Khair Khanamoves beyond the headlines to transport you to an Afghanistan you have never seen before. This is a story of war, but it is also a story of sisterhood and resilience in the face of despair. Kamila Sidiqi's journey will inspire you, but it will also change the way you think about one of the most important political and humanitarian issues of our time.Amazon Exclusive: Greg Mortenson Interviews Gayle Tzemach LemmonSince a 1993 climb of Pakistan's K2,Greg Mortensonhas worked in rural Afghanistan and Pakistan to promote education and literacy--establishing 145 schools, primarily for girls, which provide education to over 64,000 students, including 52,000 females. He is a co-author ofThe New York TimesbestsellersThree Cups of TeaandStones Into Schools.Greg Mortenson:InThe Dressmaker of Khair Khana, Kamila and her sisters sew a collection of wedding dresses overnight for a wedding party they later find out is connected to the Taliban. How did writing this book affect your view of the Taliban period?Gayle Tzemach Lemmon:That scene in the book captures precisely the extraordinary complexity of the period. Reporting on the Taliban period I quickly learned there were many different views of what those years were like, depending on who you were, what you did, and where you lived. A lot of women I knew, including, of course, Kamila, told me stories about local Talibs who knew of their work and even helped them to keep it going.  And they said that many of the Taliban in their neighborhood were men they had known for years who simply needed to support their families.What I kept coming back to&mdash;and what moved me deeply during so many conversations  with young women , some of them tearful&mdash;was the raw loss they felt at having been deprived of five and a half years of education.  And yet even amid all that despair they found ways to come together to build a community for the sake of their families.  We are so used to seeing women as victims of war to be pitied rather than survivors of war to be respected.  I really hopeThe Dressmaker of Khair Khanadoes its small part to change that.Mortenson:How has your work at Harvard Business School informed your view of Afghanistan&rsquo;s predicament?Lemmon:My experience at HBS has made me even more keenly aware of the constellation of obstacles facing entrepreneurs in some of the toughest parts of the world. That&rsquo;s perhaps why I am so taken by stories of entrepreneurs like Kamila who succeed every day despite all the obstacles (and sometimes even because of them).Economic growth strengthens families and communities. More attention must be paid by Afghanistan&rsquo;s leaders and the international community to the importance of making business easier for entrepreneurs, so they can spend time making money to support their families and less time fighting red tape, corruption and security obstacles.Mortenson:In many ways,The Dressmaker of Khair Khanareads like a novel, and yet it is all true. How much energy did you focus on the craft of storytelling vs. the reporting itself?Lemmon:I believe in the power of stories to shape and change our world. The Dressmaker happens to be set in Afghanistan during the Taliban, but it could just as easily have been the US during the Civil War or the UK during World War II. Storytelling allows us to see just how similar our struggles really are. My hope was that my godmother and my aunt, who will never go to Afghanistan, could pick up this book and see themselves in this universal story of family and faith.For me, the reporting is where the joy is&mdash;it&rsquo;s a privilege to be allowed to take a step into people&rsquo;s lives and to be entrusted with telling their story. In this case the reporting was much more physically difficult than the storytelling&mdash;the fall of 2008 in particular was a time during which kidnappings and bombings became regular occurrences in Kabul; both Afghans and foreigners I visited with constantly swapped stories of terrifying incidents which involved their friends and relatives. I knew a lot of people who were affected by the violence, and all the insecurity made it much harder to convince young women to speak with me about their experiences.Mortenson:You&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time on the ground in Afghanistan. What is it like to travel there as a young woman?Lemmon:I love going to Afghanistan, though the trip from California is nearly 40 hours. It is a beautiful country with incredibly generous people who will give you anything they have even if it is all they have. (And I highly recommend the food!)Being a young woman actually made my work easier. I could meet women of all ages and spend time with them at their homes hearing their stories and sharing my own.  This is a world many foreign men will never have access to, for cultural reasons. I also could meet Afghan men because, as a foreign woman, you sort of fit a third category&mdash;not male, but not exactly female, either. I worked hard to build trust with those women and men who entrusted me with their stories&mdash;I tried to learn Dari and to draw as little attention to my &lsquo;foreign-ness&rsquo; as possible: I often was the frumpiest woman I saw all day in my uniform of black pants, black socks, black shoes, black t-shirt, and a dark jacket and head scarf. I think those I wrote about respected the fact that I kept coming back to Afghanistan.Mortenson:You've worked and studied in conflict and post-conflict regions such as Rwanda, Bosnia and Afghanistan. Women are rarely involved in the high level decision making that affects conflict negotiations or even consulted about their own creative ideas for resolution. How can we help and empower women to play a much larger role in resolving conflicts?Lemmon:This is a question I think about all the time. We are used to women pulling families through war, but having no say in the peace which follows. This must change for the world to be a safer, more stable place.A great example has been set by the women of Liberia, who insisted their voices be heeded when it came time for UN negotiations to end their nation&rsquo;s civil war. (There is a great film about their push to be heard called &ldquo;Pray the Devil Back to Hell.&rdquo;) Afghan women, too, are speaking up to make sure that no peace negotiations happen without their real and substantive representation. Each one of us can help advance their cause and this effort by insisting that our own elected officials don&rsquo;t take part in any talks in which women don&rsquo;t take part. Holding our own leaders accountable is a great place to start.",

One day they detect &#x201C;a pleasant aroma&#x201D; (grilling hamburgers) and decide to satisfy their hunger at whatever cost. The chase that follows involves distractions (a squirrel in a tree), misunderstandings about the family that is grilling, and a series of ludicrous attack plans that surprisingly results in a tasty conclusion.

Madcap, touching, laugh-out-loud funny and thoroughly satisfying on all emotional levels, her latest London-set historical focuses on Hyacinth, the eighth sibling in Quinn's bestselling Bridgerton family series (followingWhen He Was Wicked). Too intelligent for her own good and best friends with Lady Danbury, one of society's most outspoken grande dames, Hyacinth is in her fourth season on London's Marriage Mart and again unimpressed by the male selection. Only Lady Danbury's handsome, pockets-to-let grandson Gareth St. Clair can hold his own in a conversation with her and sometimes even leaves her in a speechless, stomach-flipping state. When Hyacinth offers to translate the diary of Gareth's deceased Italian grandmother, the pair find themselves comparing notes, then exchanging kisses and finally burglarizing his estranged father's house at midnight. But the diary also holds secrets that could jeopardize their new love. Practically bouncing with humor, this book will keep readers happily on edge, waiting to see how the final unmarried Bridgerton will fare in Quinn's talented hands.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0061176044": "Starred Review. In the spirit ofBlinkandPredictably Irrational(but with a large helping of erudition), journalist Schulz casts a fresh and irreverent eye upon the profound meanings behind our most ordinary behaviors&mdash;in this instance, how we make mistakes, how we behave when we find we have been wrong, and how our errors change us. [I]t is ultimately wrongness, not rightness, that can teach us who we are, she asserts. Schulz writes with such lucidity and wit that her philosophical enquiry becomes a page-turner. She deftly incorporates Wittgenstein, Descartes, and Freud, along with an array of contemporary social scientists and even a spin with Shakespeare and Keats. There's heavy stuff here, but no heavy-handedness. Being wrong encompasses the cataclysmic (economic collapse) and the commonplace (leaving a laptop in front of the window before the storm). Being wrong may lead to fun (playing with and understanding optical illusions) or futility (the Millerite expectation of the Rapture in 1844). Being wrong can be transformative, and Schultz writes, I encourage us to see error as a gift in itself, a rich and irreplaceable source of humor, art, illumination, individuality, and change&mdash;an apt description of her engrossing study.(June)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Fortuitously, a forest grows in his room, allowing his wild rampage to continue unimpaired. Sendak's color illustrations (perhaps his finest) are beautiful, and each turn of the page brings the discovery of a new wonder.The wild things--with their mismatched parts and giant eyes--manage somehow to be scary-looking without ever really being scary; at times they're downright hilarious. Sendak's defiantly run-on sentences--one of his trademarks--lend the perfect touch of stream of consciousness to the tale, which floats between the land of dreams and a child's imagination.This Sendak classic is more fun than you've ever had in a wolf suit, and it manages to reaffirm the notion that there's no place like home.--This text refers to thePaperbackedition.",
        "0060584750": "Ever since blasting onto the literary scene with the Shamus Award-winningA Drink Before the War, Dennis Lehane has been the golden boy of noir. His Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro novels are marvels of tight pacing, dialogue so good it gets under your skin and stays there, with dead-on portrayals of working-class Boston neighborhoods. Sure, he's the oft-proclaimed, hard-boiled heir to Hammett and Chandler, but Lehane also takes a page from the Hemingway school of hyper-intense writing. He pares away and pares away until he's left with the absolute essentials--and then those essentials just explode off the page.In his five Kenzie-Gennaro novels, the detective duo is at the nexus of Lehane's  big bang. Darkly funny and just this side of jaded, Angie and Patrick move  through Dorchester's bleak streets with an assurance born of familiarity. It's  impossible to imagine these streets without the pair, or to imagine the pair  away from those streets.Mystic River, then, arrives as a bit of a  gamble, as Lehane moves from the sharp edges of portraiture to the broader  strokes of landscape. No Angie, no Patrick: this neighborhood is on its own.  It's not any prettier and certainly no friendlier, and its working-class  fa&ccedil;ade still barely masks the irresistible tug of violent ways, means,  and ends.Twenty-five years ago, Dave Boyle got into a car. When he came back four days  later, he was different in a way that destroyed his friendship with Sean Devine  and Jimmy Marcus. Now Sean's a cop, Jimmy's a store owner with a prison record  and mob connections, and Dave's trying hard to keep his demons safely submerged.  When Jimmy's daughter Katie is found murdered, each of the men must confront a  past that none is eager to acknowledge. Lehane tugs delicately on the strands  that weave this neighborhood together, testing for their strengths and  weaknesses; this novel seems as much anthropological case study as thriller.By turns violent and pensive,Mystic Riveris vintage Lehane. How good is  it? You may go in missing Angie and Patrick, but after a few pages you won't  even realize they're gone. Lehane's noir is still black magic.--Kelly  Flynn--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",
        "0060753943": "If you judge books by their covers, Jack Welch'sWinningcertainly grabs your attention. Testimonials on the back come from none other than Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, Rudy Giuliani, and Tom Brokaw, and other praise comes fromFortune,Business Week, andFinancial Times. As the legendary retired CEO of General Electric, Welch has won many friends and admirers in high places. In this latest book, he strives to show why.Winningdescribes the management wisdom that Welch built up through four and a half decades of work at GE, as he transformed the industrial giant from a sleepy \"Old Economy\" company with a market capitalization of $4 billion to a dynamic new one worth nearly half a trillion dollars.Welch's first book,Jack: Straight from the Gut, was structured more as a conventional CEO memoir, with stories of early career adventures, deals won and lost, boardroom encounters, and Welch's process and philosophy that helped propel his success as a manager. InWinning, Welch focuses on his actual management techniques. He starts with an overview of cultural values such as candor, differentiation among employees, and inclusion of all voices in decision-making. In the second section he covers issues around one's own company or organization: the importance of hiring, firing, the people management in between, and a few other juicy topics like crisis management. From there, Welch moves into a discussion of competition, and the external factors that can influence a company's success: strategy, budgeting, and mergers and acquisitions. Welch takes a more personal turn later with a focus on individual career issues--how to find the right job, get promoted, and deal with a bad boss--and then a final section on what he calls \"Tying Up Loose Ends.\" Those interested in the human side of great leaders will find this last section especially appealing. In it, Welch answers the most interesting questions that he's received in the last several years while traveling the globe addressing audiences of executives and business-school students. Perhaps the funniest question in this section comes at the very end, posed originally by a businessman in Frankfurt, who queried Welch on whether he thought he'd go to heaven (we won't give away the ending).While different from the steadier stream of war stories and real-life examples of Welch's first book,Winningis a very worthwhile addition to any management bookshelf. It's not often that a CEO described as the century's best retires, and then chooses to expound on such a wide range of management topics. Also, aside from the commentary on always-relevant issues like employee performance reviews and quality control, Welch suffuses this book with his pugnacious spirit. The Massachusetts native who fought his way to the top of the world's most valuable company was in many ways the embodiment of \"Winning,\" and this spirit alone will provide readers an enjoyable read.--Peter Han",

        "0061002860": "This novel, written in 1927, is considered the best and most successful of the early mysteries. It met with no small outrage when it appeared, as it uses a plot device many readers thought \"unfair.\" There is a full complement of characters populating the cozy English village of King's Abbot: Major Blunt, Colonel Carter, Miss Gannett, the butler, the housekeeper, the narrator, Dr. Sheppard, and his know-it-all sister (the precursor of Miss Marple, according to Christie), and, of course, the redoubtable Hercule Poirot and his little grey cells.

And many believe these shifts are doing more than just rocking the political and social climate; they're rocking the American core.What are these changes? Who, in addition to President Obama, have been the biggest forces behind them? What exactly do they mean for you, the everyday American citizen? How are they affecting your money, health, safety, freedom, and standing in this nation? Which are Pinheaded moves and which are truly Patriotic? In his latest spirited book, O'Reilly prompts further debate with the President and the American people on the current state of the union.After five consecutive, no-nonsense, tell-it-like-it-is megabestsellers, you can count on Bill to offer blunt and constructive political commentary.

You, along with a myriad of comrades and enemies alike &#151; up to 256 in all &#151; are dropped into this unprecedented war. To start off you must prove yourself as a member of your 8-man squad, fighting for one of the PMCs. With enough experience you may even become an elite fighter or earn the right to lead a squad, platoon or ultimately an entire army of players. Can you, will you follow orders? Either way your destiny and those of 255 other fighters awaits on the battlefield ofMAG.GameplayInMAGplayers take on the role of a member of a private military corporation (PMC), in a fictional Earth future. Like most MMO games, as well as some modern shooters, the ultimate goal of action is the leveling up of your character, in this case through success in combat against other factions made up of individual online players. At the initial level players choose the PMC they will be aligned with, the physical characteristics of their character, initial available weaponry, etc. and hit the battlefield with other squad members within a persistent online environment. Along the way you will utilize a diverse skill tree to develop your character's abilities and skills at tactics and weapons using experience points that are accumulated in campaign and mission play in the name of your faction. These points are given out in various increments for all manner of action, whether that be objective completion, or individual actions in combat. Once characters reach a certain level they are eligible to take on command duties. These duties range from leading an eight-man squad, all the way to overall command of more than 100 online players. Orders are communicated and strategy developed via voice chat and other functionality. Success in command positions allows for access to special \"leadership bonuses\" that not only can improve your abilities, but also in many cases, that of the individuals and units under your command.So, how does one give orders to human individuals online? Just as you would to AI (artificial intelligence) characters. The beauty ofMAGis that players are free to ignore orders issued by superiors at any time. Experience point totals, the nuts and bolts of character leveling, are higher for successes achieved through orders that follow the chain of command though. War, especially that featuring multiple factions, can be fought in many ways, and in MMO gameplay world ofMAGit's up to you to decided the path you'll follow.Private Military Corporations (PMCs)Bound by the terms of the terms of the Millennium Accord, which prevents defense forces from crossing borders, nations with theMAGgame world turn to the services of Private Military Corporations (PMCs) to secure interests abroad.

Contoured perfectly to fit a player's hand,The Wii Nunchuk (left) connects directly to the Wii remote.View larger.the Nunchuk controller builds on the simplicity of the Wii Remote controller. The Nunchuk contains the same three-axis motion sensor found in the Wii Remote, but also includes an analog stick, and two buttons to help assist in character movement.Many games will allow you to control your character's movement with the Nunchuk in your left hand, while your right hand is free to execute the action movements with the Wii Remote. For example, the Nunchuk is particularly useful for games like Wii Boxing. You can use the Nunchuk to punch with your weaker hand, while you use the Wii remote to punch and jab with your predominant hand.Take the fun to the next level with two-handed control of your games.View larger.In first-person shooters, the Nunchuk controller carries the burden of movement, freeing you to aim and fire using a more natural motion with the Wii Remote. In a football game, you can make your quarterback elusive with the Nunchuk controller while you search for an open receiver to throw to using the Wii Remote. Serious gamers may even want to use two Nunchuk controllers to gain a fierce competitive edge.Because the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers are only relatively dependent on each other, players are free to hold them in whichever hand is most comfortable. Perfectly suitable for either right or left-hand use, the Wii Nunchuk controller grants accessibility not often seen in previous game controllers.Also, the Nunchuk controller doesn't need its own power--it plugs into the Wii Remote controller when it's in use. So there's no need to worry about charging or replacing expensive batteries.Adding a Nunchuk to your Wii system will definitely help you open the doors to the next level of gaming, and seriously step up performance. Just be careful not to knock out your significant other, or bruise the dog, severely, while using one, or two Nunchuk controllers.",

In doing so, he&#x2019;s confronted the darkest secrets of his home state of Mississippi. Shifting between the 1960s (not a pretty period in Mississippi history) and the present, it&#x2019;s the story of a respected doctor accused of murdering his former nurse, an African-American woman who has returned to Natchez after many years up north. The doctor&#x2019;s son, Penn Cage (featured in previous Iles novels), is a former prosecutor, now the mayor of Natchez, whose attempts to clear his father bring him face to face with a fringe KKK sect, men who personify the South&#x2019;s historic evils. Packed to the point of overflow with racial politics, family secrets, illicit love, corruption, racism, brutality, and fear, this 800-page book is really a father-son story.

Books such asThe  Middle EastandThe Arabs  in Historyare required reading for anybody who hopes to understand the  region and its people. Now Lewis offersWhat Went Wrong?, a concise and  timely survey of how Islamic civilization fell from worldwide leadership in  almost every frontier of human knowledge five or six centuries ago to a \"poor,  weak, and ignorant\" backwater that is today dominated by \"shabby tyrannies ...  modern only in their apparatus of repression and terror.\" He offers no easy  answers, but does provide an engaging chronicle of the Arab encounter with  Europe in all its military, economic, and cultural dimensions. The most dramatic  reversal, he says, may have occurred in the sciences: \"Those who had been  disciples now became teachers; those who had been masters became pupils, often  reluctant and resentful pupils.\" Today's Arab governments have blamed their  plight on any number of external culprits, from Western imperialism to the Jews.  Lewis believes they must instead commit to putting their own houses in order:  \"If the peoples of Middle East continue on their present path, the suicide  bomber may become a metaphor for the whole region, and there will be no escape  from a downward spiral of hate and spite, rage and self-pity, [and] poverty and  oppression.\" Anybody who wants to understand the historical backdrop to  September 11 would do well to look for it on these pages.--John Miller--This text refers to theHardcoveredition.",

And with the addition of activities like Skateboarding and Rhythm Kung Fu, players will be using the Wii Balance Board accessory in a variety of new and fun ways.GameplayAs with the originalWii Fitrelease,Wii Fit Plusis designed, as its name implies, to improve the user's fitness. The game contains a large number of activities that fall into a variety of categories, including: yoga, aerobics, strength training and balance games. With all but a few exceptions, which utilize variations on a standard Wii Remote configuration, all activities utilize the Wii Balance Board (not included, but available with theWii Fit PlusBalance Board Bundle), either alone or configured with either a Wii Remote alone or the Wii Remote and nunchuck. The Balance Board, like any other Wii controller acts as a motion/pressure sensing device wirelessly synched to your Wii and replicating your body's movements. Each controller employed occupies one of the Wii's four wireless inputs, together mapping the reference points needed to recreate most full body motions on screen. Although this limits the majority of the activities to a single player orientation, various activities throughout the game support up to eight players in alternating play.To useWii Fit Plusplayers import their Miis from their Wii system, set up profiles, establish a current physical baseline, set fitness goals, and embark on a routine to reach them.Wii Fit Plustracks your usage, weight and progress towards your goal over time, giving you a status report as you start each session. At any time players can choose whatever activity they want, whether exercise or balance game, and as they progress in these they will level up in each, gaining points, setting high scores and unlocking more activities.Personalization Option Via 'The Locker Room'The originalWii Fitwas designed to have something for everyone. NowWii Fit Plusraises the bar by providing users with personalization options that allow them to find/create a specific workout routine that is exactly right for them, their family and their lifestyle. One example of this is \"The Locker Room.\" Easily accessible throughout the game, here players can choose from a number customizable options that allow them to maximize their time withWii Fit Pluswithout having to navigate through the game menu while in the middle of a workout. In essence this allows players to become their own personal trainer. Customization options available within The Locker Room include: preprogrammed and timedWii Fit PlusRoutines; My Routine, where you choose your own set of activities, optimizing their length and area of the body to be focused on; and Favorites, a notation of activities you frequent, which provides fast access to exercises you enjoy doing the most.Addition Yoga and Strength ExercisesDesigned as an addition to the already substantial list of focused, physical exercises available inWii Fit,Wii Fit Pluscontains six new and challenging strength and yoga activities. But continuing with the game's commitment to personalization, the key to these additions is not in their volume, but in how the player chooses to mix and match them. Do them in the order they are presented, or combine them in whatever order you want. The choice is yours. The player even has the ability to repeat the ones that he/she prefers, maximizing attention and effort where it is needed most. In addition, for those to whom time is a commodity, you can now omit unnecessary interludes between exercises, making for a continuous, timesaving routine.A Wealth of New Balance GamesRegardless of the considerable fitness factor packed intoWii Fit Plus, the Nintendo brand is and will always be all about having fun. With that in mindWii Fit Plusalso comes packed with 15 new, entertaining balance games suitable for every member of the family. Just a few of those that players can expect to see are: Juggling; Skateboarding; Snowball Fight; Obstacle Course, a log-leaping, cannonball-evading event reminiscent of what Nintendo icon Mario must go through; and Perfect 10, a balance game designed to promote a combination of physical and mental health. In this final example the player's Mii is situated between multiple color-coated balls, each showing specific numbers, with the goal to swing your hips, hula style, in different directions to tap out a total of ten as many times as possible before time runs out.Key Game FeaturesUsers can input the amount of time they want to spend on their workouts or select an area for personal improvement, andWii Fit Pluswill suggest a number of diverse activities for them.For the first time, users can mix and match which strength and yoga activities they prefer on a given day.

In Shel Silverstein's popular tale of few words and simple line drawings, a tree starts out as a leafy playground, shade provider, and apple bearer for a rambunctious little boy. Making the boy happy makes the tree happy, but with time it becomes more challenging for the generous tree to meet his needs. When he asks for money, she suggests that he sell her apples. When he asks for a house, she offers her branches for lumber. When the boy is old, too old and sad to play in the tree, he asks the tree for a boat. She suggests that he cut her down to a stump so he can craft a boat out of her trunk. He unthinkingly does it. At this point in the story, the double-page spread shows a pathetic solitary stump, poignantly cut down to the heart the boy once carved into the tree as a child that said \"M.E. + T.\" \"And then the tree was happy... but not really.\" When there's nothing left of her, the boy returns again as an old man, needing a quiet place to sit and rest. The stump offers up her services, and he sits on it. \"And the tree was happy.\" While the message of this book is unclear (Take and take and take?  Give and give and give? Complete self-sacrifice is good? Complete self-sacrifice is infinitely sad?), Silverstein has perhaps deliberately left the book open to interpretation. (All ages)--Karin Snelson",

Now I have a third:Outlaw Platoon. It&rsquo;s theBlack Hawk Downfor the 21st Century. It is an absolutely gripping, edge-of-your-seat ride that follows these men when the fates foolishly attempt to stack the deck against them. This book has Hollywood blockbuster written all over it. But there&rsquo;s much more than just the guns-blazing action. It is an epic tale of leadership, heroism, and the bond among warriors who ply their deadly trade with a deceivingly simple mandate&mdash;to kill the enemy and return home together alive. It&rsquo;s an absolute must read!Brad Thor Interviews Sean ParnellBrad Thor:What was your first day like on the ground in Afghanistan&rsquo;s eastern frontier?Sean Parnell:The moment I arrived at Forward Operating Base Bermel, the insurgents attacked the base with rocket fire. They missed the FOB, but hit a local village, killing and wounding a number of children. The villagers rushed their injured to our front gate, and I ran to help. Our troops wanted to help all of the children, but the Afghan fathers insisted the boys be treated first. I grabbed a little girl anyways and sprinted for the aid station. She bled out in my arms as I ran.That was my introduction to combat. All I was, all I had been, changed in that instant.Thor:What surprised you about the enemy in Afghanistan?Parnell:We found an enemy that wasn&rsquo;t a bunch of farmers with leftover weapons, but one of the finest light infantry forces in the world. These fighters were brilliantly led, seasoned warriors. Some had spent their entire lives in combat&mdash;stretching back to the Soviet War in the 1980&rsquo;s. They were elusive, heavily armed and extremely well equipped with the latest armor-piercing bullets, anti-tank weapons, body armor, and other gear essential to ground operations.They also had no mercy. None. Their objective was to overrun an American platoon, behead everyone and stick our heads on stakes. In battle, we heard them on the radio ordering their teams to do this, and we saw the huge knives they carried for the task.They did their best to overrun us three times. But we were better. Just barely.Thor:Describe the bond forged in battle&mdash;the loyalty and bravery you saw and why you think that&rsquo;s vital to success.Parnell:During my 16 months in combat I saw the noblest aspects of the human spirit, thanks to the bond that developed among the men. We realized that the only way we could survive this crucible was to remain committed to each other. Not for ourselves, but to ensure that we would survive to see our loved ones back home again.Thor:How would you describe the men in your platoon?Parnell:In a word: unique. Our army mirrors the country it&rsquo;s sworn to protect, and I think the Outlaws reflected America&rsquo;s greatest strength: diversity. My men came from all walks of life. They believed in American exceptionalism with every fiber of their being. And if they were similar in any way, it was in this ideal.",
        "0062237470": "An Amazon Best Book of the Month, May 2014:If you missed the highly praised HBO documentary50 Children, you can get the whole story from this excellent chronicle by journalist Steven Pressman, who also wrote, directed, and produced the film. Gilbert and Eleanor Kraus were typical members of an affluent, educated Jewish community in Philadelphia in the 1930s; Gilbert was a lawyer, and Eleanor a bit of a shopaholic. Worried about what they were hearing from Europe by 1939, the Krauses set out to travel to Austria and Germany to save Jewish children from the advancing Nazis; they were not particularly religious or political and this was not an easy task in an era plagued by anti-Semitism and isolationism.  But through careful readings of the law, loopholes in the visa-granting system, and plain old bravery, the Krauses managed to bring more than four dozen children to safety in the United States.  Pressman, the Krauses&#x2019; grandson-in-law, used Eleanor Kraus&#x2019;s unpublished diaries as well as photographs, documents, and interviews  to recreate a historical moment and a heroic act. Like Oskar Schindler and his list, the Krauses and their 50 children will now never be forgotten.--Sara Nelson",

In this world, the survivors struggle to stay alive by living indoors with all the windows boarded up. The sight of whatever is outside is causing people to become violent murderers, as well as suicidal, in the most horrific ways possible. The book moves back and forth over a four-year period when all the insanity began, exploring the personalities of the people that came together and survived and how they managed to live after all forms of communication effectively withered and died with most of the population. The characters are involving, the story moves along very rapidly as the suspense builds, but unfortunately, the ending is a disappointment. The reason for all the bloodshed is never explored or explained. Still, recommend this one to readers who enjoy a blend of horror and postapocalyptic fiction. --Stacy Alesi",

Players control Ico with the goal of  escaping the castle with the princess safely in hand.Although it looks like an adventure game and has some rudimentary action  sequences, Ico is mostly about solving puzzles. Players will run, jump, and  climb their way through the gargantuan castle as well as figure out which  objects and environments are interactive. Yorda is very much a damsel in  distress, and isn't nearly as capable as Ico. A great deal of the puzzles  require the player to create a safe path for Yorda, who isn't physically able to  get to the places Ico can. The puzzles are quite brilliant, although a few are  so tough that players will feel like ditching the princess.Graphics, particularly the lighting effects and animations, are fantastic. The  developers did a superb job of conveying the enormity and beauty of the castle.  When Ico and Yorda move and interact, their actions seem totally lifelike. The  ambient soundtrack and simple controls let the player focus on the tasks at  hand. Sony has crafted a very unique game that anyone can play.

Starting with Pocahontas and Eleanor Dare (the first female colonist), this lively and fascinating history records the changes in American women's lives and the transformations in American society from the 1580s through the 2000s.A history of the oft-marginalized sex must often draw from diaries and journals, which were disproportionally written by whites; as a result, African-American and Native American women are not as well represented as white in the earlier chapters ofAmerica's Women. However, Gail Collins writes about women of many races and ethnicities, and in fact provides more information about Native Americans, African-Americans, and Chinese, Jewish, and Italian immigrants than some general U.S. history books. She writes about rich and poor, young and old, urban and rural, slave and slave-owner, athlete and aviatrix, president's wife and presidential candidate--and, of course, men and women. And some of these women--from the justly famous, like Clara Barton and Harriet Tubman, to the undeservedly obscure, like Elizabeth Eckford and Senator Margaret Chase Smith--will not only make any woman proud to be a woman, they will make any American proud to be American.An editor at theNew York Times, Gail Collins has also writtenScorpion Tongues: Gossip, Celebrity, and American Politicsand, with Dan Collins,The Millennium Book.--Cynthia Ward--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",
        "0060563079": "\"All children, except one, grow up.\" Thus begins a great classic of children's literature that we all remember as magical. What we tend to forget, because the tale of Peter Pan and Neverland has been so relentlessly boiled down, hashed up, and coated in saccharine, is that J.M. Barrie's original version is also witty, sophisticated, and delightfully odd. The Darling children, Wendy, John, and Michael, live a very proper middle-class life in Edwardian London, but they also happen to have a Newfoundland for a nurse. The text is full of such throwaway gems as \"Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter Pan when she was tidying up her children's minds,\" and is peppered with deliberately obscure vocabulary including \"embonpoint,\" \"quietus,\" and \"pluperfect.\" Lest we forget, it was written in 1904, a relatively innocent age in which a plot about abducted children must have seemed more safely fanciful. Also, perhaps, it was an age that expected more of its children's books, forPeter Panhas a suppleness, lightness, and intelligence that are \"literary\" in the best sense. In a typical exchange with the dastardly Captain Hook, Peter Pan describes himself as \"youth... joy... a little bird that has broken out of the egg,\" and the author interjects: \"This, of course, was nonsense; but it was proof to the unhappy Hook that Peter did not know in the least who or what he was, which is the very pinnacle of good form.\" A book for adult readers-aloud to revel in--and it just might teach young listeners to fly.

        "0062228838": "*Starred Review* Discovered on ancient clay tablets in Crete in 1900 and deciphered half a century later, Linear B is the oldest known dialect of the Greek language, dating from about 1450 BCE. The story of its discovery by British archaeologist Arthur Evans and decipherment by British architect Michael Ventris is often told, but what is less frequently documented is the story of the American woman, Alice Kober, who laid much of the groundwork for the decipherment and who might have cracked the code herself, if she had not died in her early forties. Focusing on Kober&#x2019;s efforts to tease meaning out of the strange, hitherto unknown symbols, Fox tells the story behind the story. Yes, Ventris made some brilliant deductive leaps, but without Kober&#x2019;s years of painstaking work, those leaps could not have happened. You might think a book about trying to decipher a 3,000-year-old language wouldn&#x2019;t be particularly exciting, but in this case you&#x2019;d be wrong. Fox is a talented storyteller, and she creates an atmosphere of almost nail-biting suspense. We know the code was eventually cracked, but while we&#x2019;re reading the book, we&#x2019;re on the edge of our seats. This one deserves shelf space alongside such classics in the literature of decryption as Simon Singh&#x2019;s The Code Book (1999). --David Pitt",

It&rsquo;s quite a startling device (I loved it in Joshua Ferris&rsquo;sThen We Came to the End). Why did you use it inThe Most Dangerous Thing?Laura Lippman:The decision was intuitive at first&mdash;that is, I knew it was right, without knowing why it was right. When I finished the book, I realized that these passages are a consensual version of what happened in the past, that the survivors have agreed on what happened and that&rsquo;s why the story is, at turns, unflattering to each of them. They are working out their level of culpability in several tragedies and they just can&rsquo;t face this alone. And that voice allowed me to include a subtext of gloom and foreboding&mdash;the story is being told by people who know how badly it ends.KA:Do you think you write better now than you did when you first began to write novels? (I only ask because I think I&rsquo;m a much better writer than I used to be but no one else seems to have noticed.) Do you feel you can trust your &ldquo;inner critic&rdquo; or are you plagued by doubts the whole time you are writing?LL:At the risk of sounding obsequious, I have to say that you set the bar awfully high for yourself withBehind the Scenes at the Museum, but I&rsquo;ve noticed how your work has changed, although I think the word that comes to mind isn&rsquo;t better, but bolder. You take such big risks and yet you manage them with aplomb. The frustration of being a fan of your work is that there&rsquo;s nothing quite like it. There are lots of wonderful writers in crime and literary fiction, but there&rsquo;s only person who can write a Kate Atkinson novel.I didn&rsquo;t start out on the same level. That&rsquo;s not poor-mouthing, as my Southern relatives would have it, but a fact on which everyone agrees. People tell me all the time&mdash;really, all the time&mdash;how far I&rsquo;ve come since my first book. But, whether one writes a great first novel or simply a decent one, what are the choices? One can get better, worse, or stay the same. I shoot for better and I accept that there may be some dips, but they&rsquo;ll come from trying new things at least, not doing the same things over and over. I do trust my inner critic, but I'm happy to have a circle of external critics that I trust as well.KA:You &ldquo;honor&rdquo; the dead in your novels rather than exploit them for sadistic effect. Do you think that&rsquo;s due to your background as a reporter butting up against real lives rather than fictional ones? Or because you&rsquo;re a woman? Or just a decent human being?LL:All of the above? At least, I hope I&rsquo;m a decent person. I do think crime writers need to take a moment for introspection about the stories we&rsquo;re telling and the bodies that are piling up around us. It&rsquo;s somber stuff. There should be an agenda beyond sensation.KA:How many novels do you have on the back burner at any one time? Have you ever sat down to write and not had any idea what you were going to do?LL:Once&mdash;just once&mdash;I managed to have two projects going on simultaneously, a novel and a novella. I do best with one thing in front of me. And, increasingly, I have no idea what I&rsquo;m going to write next. But that&rsquo;s part of the job and, for me, part of the fun. I know a book is finished when I&rsquo;m ready to sit down and ask myself, &ldquo;What next, what interests me right now?&rdquo; WithThe Most Dangerous Thing, I was interested in the way life becomes a kind of horror film at middle age. About two months after I started this book, my father-in-law died after a long decline. About the same time, one of my husband&rsquo;s oldest friends, dating back to his days on the college newspaper, had a stroke at the age of 48, and died within hours. Yesterday, I picked upThe New York Timesand happened on a first-person piece by a former colleague, who wrote about having ALS and his intention to commit suicide while he was still able-bodied. He's only 66.But I also became a parent for the first time last year, which isn&rsquo;t one of the typical milestones of middle-age, yet there it was. And it had a huge impact on the book.KA:Do you feel guilty when you&rsquo;re not writing, even when the other thing you&rsquo;re doing is totally fulfilling or completely altruistic or utterly well deserved?LL:If I&rsquo;ve been disciplined&mdash;gone to my desk every weekday morning, written at least 1,000 words&mdash;I seldom feel guilty. I feel much more guilt-ridden about not reading enough.But I will steal a line from Anne Lamott, who once said if people knew how good she felt writing they would set her on fire. Just this morning I was working and it wasn&rsquo;t an on-fire moment, but it wasn&rsquo;t a bad day either. Just an average one, the kind of days one has in the dead middle of books. I took a sip of my latte, looked at the clock on my computer and thought: It is 10:10 a.m. and my job is to sit here and make things up. I am a very lucky person.KA:&ldquo;I've never wanted people to feel good at the end of my novels,&rdquo; you said in aPublishers Weeklyinterview. But do you feel good when you finish?LL:I feel fabulous. It's the best day of the year. But even on a book-a-year schedule, that means I feel fabulous only one day a year.

In this third chapter of theHalotrilogy, Master Chief returns to finish the fight, bringing the epic conflict between the Covenant, the Flood, and the entire human race to a dramatic, pulse-pounding climax.Get ready. The Chief is back.HDR lighting, self-shadowing, and more makeHalo 3look and feel realistic.View larger.Mystery abounds with the return of Cortana.View larger.Earth is conquered. The Covenant is everywhere. Halo 3 promises to be an epic journey.View larger.Game developer Bungie announced thatHalo 3will be released for Microsoft's Xbox 360 sometime in 2007. The game was revealed to the world at the Microsoft press conference held at Grauman's Chinese Theater in Hollywood, CA in May 2006. To gamer's delight, the announcement was a complete surprise. The rumors have been abound for the past year, as everyone wondered when the next installment would be ready. Bungie and Microsoft did a stellar job keeping their lips sealed, and fans benefited from their first glimpse of the hallowed third and final installment.The short presentation was delivered in real-time on the Xbox 360 using the current version of theHalo 3game engine. That's right, no studio production video, Bungie and Microsoft delivered the real deal: what they showed at the announcement is what gamers will see when they play Halo 3 in 2007. The HDR lighting, self-shadowing, GPU-run particle system and many other effects are rumored to show up in full effect in the final game. Needless to say, the gaming community is salivating.CJ Cowan, Bungie's director of cinematics discussed one of the most startling moments of the presentation: the return of Cortana. \"Given the variety of character and story arcs at the end ofHalo 2, we wanted to boil down our announcement to a few key threads. Cortana and the Chief being a galaxy apart is a situation we haven't seen before, and is something that is a powerful component toHalo 3. We are using her transmissions in the demo to give the viewer a few subtle clues to her situation and state of mind, without revealing any specifics we want to save for the game itself.\"Graphically, the game closely follows in the tradition ofHalo 2, although it has been upgraded to take advantage of the Xbox 360's more prodigious visual abilities. As art direct Marcus Lehto explained, \"[The presentation] was intended to be an understated announcement ofHalo 3-- the tone is that of mystery and suspense -- the calm before the storm. I wanted to make sure that we reintroduced the Chief, showed that Earth was thoroughly conquered, with Covenant everywhere, and that there is a glorious, ancient artifact buried under the Earth's crust which will provideHalo 3with the epic journey which we all want.\"Taking full advantage of the power of Xbox 360,Halo 3expands on everything that has made the franchise great, adding a wealth of technical and gameplay advancements. The game design has evolved with next-generation, high-definition visuals, enhanced A.I., an advanced real-time lighting engine, and, of course, new weapons, characters, and challenges.Halo 3promises an unparalleled first-person shooter experience and, in the end, the most compelling and engrossing story in the franchise's history. Last, but certainly not least,Halo 3builds upon the unique social multiplayer experience and innovative, evolving online gameplay ofHalo 2.

When legendary German conductor Helmut Wellauer is found dead in his dressing room two acts into a performance of La Traviata , police commissario Guido Brunetti is called in. Among those who might have provided the cyanide poison that killed the maestro, immediate suspects include the vaunted conductor's coolly indifferent young wife and those many in the music industry who are offended by his homophobia. Methodically probing into the victim's past, Brunetti also uncovers Wellauer's Nazi sympathies and a lead to a trio of singing sisters from yesteryear--one now destitute, one dead and the other missing. Though burdened by a dictatorial superior and two lumpen subordinates, Brunetti gets help from his aristocratic wife and her well-connected parents. The narrative's best moments involve Brunetti's wry exchanges with his colleagues and the cunningly masked, obvious solution.Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

        "0060537639": "A former submarine commander in Britain's Royal Navy, Menzies must enjoy doing battle. The amateur historian's lightly footnoted, heavily speculative re-creation of little-known voyages made by Chinese ships in the early 1400s goes far beyond what most experts in and outside of China are willing to assert and will surely set tongues wagging. According to Menzies's brazen but dull account of the Middle Kingdom's exploits at sea, Magellan, Dias, da Gama, Cabral and Cook only \"discovered\" lands the Chinese had already visited, and they sailed with maps drawn from Chinese charts. Menzies alleges that the Chinese not only discovered America, but also established colonies here long before Columbus set out to sea. Because China burned the records of its historic expeditions led by Zheng He, the famed eunuch admiral and the focus of this account, Menzies is forced to defend his argument by compiling a tedious package of circumstantial evidence that ranges from reasonable to ridiculous. While the book does contain some compelling claims-for example, that the Chinese were able to calculate longitude long before Western explorers-drawn from Menzies's experiences at sea, his overall credibility is undermined by dubious research methods. In just one instance, when confounded by the derivation of cryptic words on a Venetian map, Menzies first consults an expert at crossword puzzles rather than an etymologist. Such an approach to scholarship, along with a promise of more proof to come in the paperback edition, casts a shadow of doubt over Menzies's discoveries. 32 pages of color illus., 27 maps and diagrams.

And it's one heck of a fun ride. Matthew Pike is a Fish and Game officer cataloging bear populations in the remote Brooks Range--but he's also an ex-Green Beret, which comes in handy when trouble drops out of the sky in the form of a crashed bush plane, a cryptic survivor, and some very nasty and well-equipped pursuers.

The characters, while mostly familiar hero or villain types, are crisply drawn and in some cases quite sympathetic, but it's the nonstop action that carries you along.

The two personalities now awkwardly time-share Nevare's body. Using Soldier's Boy's powers, Nevare tries to destroy the Gernian road that threatens to ravage the Specks' forest home, and almost dies from exhaustion. Nursed back to health by Olikea, the Speck woman whose sole duty is to feed him enough to power his magic, Nevare must find a way to keep Gernia from destroying the forest, prevent the Specks from further spreading the plague that has decimated the Gernians and reunite the severed halves of his soul.

        "0060652969": "The Problem of Painanswers the universal question, \"Why would an  all-loving, all-knowing God allow people to experience pain and suffering?\"  Master Christian apologist C.S. Lewis asserts that pain is a problem because our  finite, human minds selfishly believe that pain-free lives would prove that God  loves us. In truth, by asking for this, we want God to love us less, not more  than he does. \"Love, in its own nature, demands the perfecting of the beloved;  that the mere 'kindness' which tolerates anything except suffering in its object  is, in that respect at the opposite pole from Love.\" In addressing \"Divine  Omnipotence,\" \"Human Wickedness,\" \"Human Pain,\" and \"Heaven,\" Lewis succeeds in  lifting the reader from his frame of reference by artfully capitulating these  topics into a conversational tone, which makes his assertions easy to swallow  and even easier to digest. Lewis is straightforward in aim as well as honest  about his impediments, saying, \"I am not arguing that pain is not painful. Pain  hurts. I am only trying to show that the old Christian doctrine that being made  perfect through suffering is not incredible. To prove it palatable is beyond my  design.\" The mind is expanded, God is magnified, and the reader is reminded that  he is not the center of the universe as Lewis carefully rolls through the  dissertation that suffering is God's will in preparing the believer for heaven  and for the full weight of glory that awaits him there. While many of us naively  wish that God had designed a \"less glorious and less arduous destiny\" for his  children, the fortune lies in Lewis's inclination to set us straight with his  charming wit and pious mind.--Jill Heatherly",

        "0060922532": "Taylor Greer and her adopted Cherokee daughter Turtle, first met in The Bean Trees , will captivate readers anew in Kingsolver's assured and eloquent sequel, which mixes wit, wisdom and the expert skills of a born raconteur into a powerfully affecting narrative. Now six years old and still bearing psychological marks of the abuse that occured before she was rescued by Taylor, Turtle is discovered by formidable Indian lawyer Annawake Fourkiller, who insists that the child be returned to the Cherokee Nation. Taylor reacts by fleeing her Tucson home with Turtle to begin a precarious existence on the road; skirting the edge of poverty and despair, she eventually realizes that Turtle has become emotionally unmoored. In taking a fresh look at the Solomonic dilemma of choosing between two equally valid claims on a child's life, Kingsolver achieves the admirable feat of making the reader understand and sympathize with both sides of the controversy, as she contrasts Taylor's inalterable mother's love with Annawake's determination to save Turtle from the stigmatization she can expect from white society. The chronicle acquires depth and humor when Kingsolver integrates the story of Taylor's mother Alice, a woman who believes that the Greers are \"doomed to be a family with no men in it\" (that she is proven wrong adds a delicious element of romance to the story). Alice's resolve to help her daughter takes her into the heart of the Cherokee Nation and results in an astonishing but credible meshing of lives. In the end, both justice and compassion are served. Kingsolver's intelligent consideration of issues of family and culture--both in her evocation of Native American society and in her depiction of the plight of a single mother--brims with insight and empathy. Every page of this beautifully controlled narrative offers prose shimmering with imagery and honed to simple lyric intensity. In short, the delights of superior fiction can be experienced here. 100,000 first printing; $125,000 ad/promo; BOMC alternate; author tour.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

The story follows several space-dwelling citizens as they aim to unlock the secrets of the universe. The specifics of those secrets presumably will be revealed over subsequent editions of the Xenosaga series (after all, this is onlyEpisode 1)--but a vital clue is held in the elusive Zohar, a mysterious artifact that is aggressively sought by evil aliens. Without spoiling the plot's surprising twists, let's just say the game's German subtitle \"Der Wille zur Macht\" (translated as \"The Will to Power\") is a less-than-subtle ode to German philosopherFriedrich Nietzsche, who is considered as one of the precursors of existentialism.Like many conventional RPG titles,Xenosaga's gameplay balances between exploration and battle modes. The game designers have thankfully spared players from any ill-conceived random battle sequences. Instead, you can concentrate directly on your quest without the repetitious enemy battles.The designers also did a good job balancing a traditional RPG structure with complex themes. However, the game seems to go out of its way to casually integrate controversial (and frankly creepy) religious imagery into the context of the game. Some may find the game offensive and disturbing; others will likely find it intellectually stimulating.Namco promises about 80 hours of gaming--but a good portion of that is non-interactive full-motion video. While the stretched-out cutscenes do add considerable depth to the characters, they're often poorly paced and too long--one takes an alarming 30 minutes to unfold! The addition of more background music might have helped to pick up the pacing, since the obligatory soundtrack is strangely absent at some critical plot points.With impressive animation and unexpected plot points,Xenosaga: Episode 1--Der Wille zer Machtis easily one of the more enjoyable RPG titles to hit the PS2. While this isn't for the happy-go-lucky gaming crowd (seeKingdom Hearts), adult-minded gamers will likely be consumed by the darkness and devious delights offered within this twisted title.--Brett AtwoodPros:Complex characters and story themesNo random battle sequencesImpressive 3-D animationCons:Long, long, looooooooong cut scenes",

As Gardner sees it, the battle between the wily Kid and the determined Garrett is perhaps the greatest of our Old West legends. Digging beneath the myths and melodrama, he begins in Las Vegas during Christmas week, 1880, when the capture and confinement of Billy the Kid made national headlines. Gardner then details the Kid's daring daylight courthouse escape on April 28, 1881, in a hail of gunfire, leaving bloodied bodies behind. I am not going to leave the country, said the Kid, and I am not going to reform, neither am I going to be taken alive again. The chase began, with Garrett finally gunning down the Kid on July 14, 1881. Gardner concludes with a survey of the Kid's robust mythic afterlife in books and films. Gardner's extensive research and authoritative approach ground this compelling historical recreation.

Although on the outs with the Saxon kings and Christian priests currently wielding the real power, a warrior as cunning and as skillful as Uhtred is always in demand when the Vikings come to call.

Fans of the franchise, as well as the fighting genre in general, will be happy to know that whether you prefer to stick with the superior abilities of top tier characters or explore the ins and outs of mid to lower level combatants, when it comes time to pick your fighter there is a wide array of choices. Also, not only will players be able to play as and against their favorite classic characters, such as Ryu, Ken, Chun-Li, Guile, Zangief, Blanka, Sagat, etc., they will also be able to take on new characters.

The first of these are Focus Attacks. These moves allow players to absorb the energy from an attack and quickly counter with their own. Used properly, Focus Attacks allow for tremendous flexibility during combat and are the end result of efforts by the game's development team to evolve combat away from the rigid memorization of set combination patterns, giving players the freedom to be creative against opponents. The other new combat feature are new powered up moves called Ultra Combos. Like standard combos their purpose is to unleash maximum damage on an opponent, but unlike the combos of old, when performed correctly these long strings of punches, kicks and moves result in changes to the in-game camera angle and quick cinematics which illustrate the strength of your skills like never before.

        "0060392827": "Gregory Maguire's chilling, wonderful retelling ofCinderellais a study in contrasts. Love and hate, beauty and ugliness, cruelty and charity--each idea is stripped of its ethical trappings, smashed up against its opposite number, and laid bare for our examination.Confessions of an Ugly Stepsisterbegins in 17th-century Holland, where the two Fisher  sisters and their mother have fled to escape a hostile England. Maguire's characters are at once more human and more fanciful than their fairy-tale originals.  Plain but smart Iris and her sister, Ruth, a hulking simpleton, are dazed and terrified as their mother, Margarethe, urges them into the strange Dutch streets. Within days, purposeful Margarethe has secured the family a place in  the home of an aspiring painter, where for a short time, they find happiness.But this isCinderella, after all, and tragedy is inevitable. When a wealthy tulip speculator commissions the painter to capture his blindingly lovely daughter, Clara, on canvas, Margarethe jumps at the chance to better their lot. \"Give me room to cast my eel spear, and let follow what may,\" she crows, and the Fisher family abandons the artist  for the upper-crust Van den Meers.When Van den Meer's wife dies during childbirth, the stage is set for Margarethe to take over the household and for Clara to adopt the role  of \"Cinderling\" in order to survive. What follows is a changeling adventure, and of course a ball, a handsome prince, a  lost slipper, and what might even be a fairy godmother. In a single magic night, the exquisite and the ugly swirl around in a heated mix:Everything about this moment hovers, trembles, all their sweet, unreasonable hopes on view before anything has had the chance to go wrong. A stepsister spins on black and white tiles, in glass  slippers and a gold gown, and two stepsisters watch with unrelieved admiration. The light pours in, strengthening in its golden hue as the sun sinks  and the evening approaches. Clara is as otherworldly as the Donkeywoman,  the Girl-Boy. Extreme beauty is an affliction...But beyond these familiar elements, Maguire's second novel becomes something else altogether--a morality play, a psychological study, a feminist manifesto, or perhaps a plain explanation of what it is to be human. Villains turn out to be heroes, and heroes disappoint. The story's narrator wryly observes, \"In the lives of children, pumpkins can turn into coaches, mice and rats into human beings. When we grow up, we  learn that it's far more common for human beings to turn into rats.\"--Therese Littleton",

In an effort to make Jack jealous,andto see a little more of the world than her isolated life on her great-uncle's estate has afforded her, Kitty devises a plan. She convinces yet another of her cousins, the honorable Freddy Standen, to pretend to be engaged to her. Her plan would bring her to London on a visit to Freddy's family and (hopefully) render the elusive Mr. Westruther madly jealous.

When Charlie learns of the death of his estranged father in Florida, he attends the funeral and learns two facts that turn his well-ordered existence upside-down: that his father was a human form of Anansi, the African trickster god, and that he has a brother, Spider, who has inherited some of their father's godlike abilities. Spider comes to visit Charlie and gets him fired from his job, steals his fianc&eacute;e, and is instrumental in having him arrested for embezzlement and suspected of murder. When Charlie resorts to magic to get rid of Spider, who's selfish and unthinking rather than evil, things begin to go very badly for just about everyone. Other characters&mdash;including Charlie's malevolent boss, Grahame Coats (\"an albino ferret in an expensive suit\"), witches, police and some of the folk fromAmerican Gods&mdash;are expertly woven into Gaiman's rich myth, which plays off the African folk tales in which Anansi stars.

A reconnaissance plane is hit with a new type of weapon that fries the internal electronics of its target. The plane crashes into the South China Sea in an area considered international waters. Unfortunately, a coup within the Chinese government has put a new leader in power who contends those waters belong to China and is willing to do anything to make his point.

Cholera outbreaks throughout the world mean that even when water is available, it could be deadly, and the 16-year-old and her mother spend their days purifying the pond water, hunting for food, persuading meager crops to grow, and standing sentry on their roof to guard against strangers.

Lynn finds herself drawn to Lucy's uncle, who is about her own age. Things come to a head when Lucy becomes deathly ill and the band of men from the nearby settlement attack Lynn's house. An overreliance on expository dialogue leads to clumsy and unnatural-sounding exchanges. The story might appeal to teens who can't get enough of dystopian survival stories, but in a crowded field, this one offers nothing new.&#x2013;Kim Dare, Fairfax County Public Schools, VA&#x3B1;(c) Copyright 2013.

        "009950569X": "Starred Review.Unabashedly inspired by Malcolm Gladwell's bestsellingThe Tipping Point,the brothers Heath&mdash;Chip a professor at Stanford's business school, Dan a teacher and textbook publisher&mdash;offer an entertaining, practical guide to effective communication. Drawing extensively on psychosocial studies on memory, emotion and motivation, their study is couched in terms of \"stickiness\"&mdash;that is, the art of making ideas unforgettable. They start by relating the gruesome urban legend about a man who succumbs to a barroom flirtation only to wake up in a tub of ice, victim of an organ-harvesting ring. What makes such stories memorable and ensures their spread around the globe? The authors credit six key principles: simplicity, unexpectedness, concreteness, credibility, emotions and stories. (The initial letters spell out \"success\"&mdash;well, almost.) They illustrate these principles with a host of stories, some familiar (Kennedy's stirring call to \"land a man on the moon and return him safely to the earth\" within a decade) and others very funny (Nora Ephron's anecdote of how her high school journalism teacher used a simple, embarrassing trick to teach her how not to \"bury the lead\"). Throughout the book, sidebars show how bland messages can be made intriguing. Fun to read and solidly researched, this book deserves a wide readership.(Jan. 16)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0060763957": "Someone was bound to go after Michael Moore eventually and this book holds nothing back. An immensely popular figure to political left-wingers, Michael Moore presents himself as a regular working-class guy in a baseball cap with the courage to take some rich and powerful folks to task for their corrupt and deceitful ways. David T. Hardy and Jason Clarke say this populist, muckraker image is pure whitewash. Believing that this charade has gone on for too long, and done too much damage to the U.S., they have written this book to expose Moore as narcissistic and irresponsible and his body of work \"as manipulative as totalitarian propaganda.\" To prove their point, they pick apart Moore's books and movies to illustrate how he is consistently manipulative, dishonest, and, at times, simply absurd. They show how he altered the timeline ofRoger and Mein order to unfairly blame things on General Motors that happened before their layoffs, not as a result of them. RegardingBowling for Columbine, the authors explain how he took quotes out of context and reassembled them to give the impression that people made speeches they did not make---most famously his interview with Charlton Heston, then president of the NRA. They also illustrate how Moore manipulated statistics in his booksDude, Where&#x92;s My CountryandStupid White Mento fit his theories, making some truly outrageous claims in the process. The authors have certainly done their homework, and it's impossible to view Moore's work the same way after reading this book. \"How does a man with so many contradictions manage to blind his enormous trove of followers to how hypocritical he really is? How does he get away with it?\" they ask.  If the authors have their way, he won't much longer. Now that Moore has joined the ranks of the rich and powerful, Hardy and Clarke have engaged in bit of muckraking of their own.--Shawn Carkonen",

David Benedictus has retained all the best elements of the original text to create a lively romp through the Hundred Acre Woods with Oscar-nominee Judi Dench narrating the way. She is joined by an excellent cast of British actors including Stephen Fry, Jane Horrocks, and Michael Williams. Using a variety of regional accents and vocal qualities, they bring Pooh, Christopher Robin, and all their friends to life. John Gould's music provides a perfect backdrop to Pooh's poetic creations and works as a natural chapter break. Good sound effects allow listeners to imagine themselves treading forest paths with the likes of Piglet and Eeyore. The cassettes are well marked, and the cover art features nicely colored versions of Ernest H. Shephard's original illustrations. The only drawback to the packaging is the clear plastic container which is likely to need replacing.

        "0060175966": "When the editors of theOxford English Dictionaryput out a call during the late 19th century pleading for &quot;men of letters&quot; to provide help with their mammoth undertaking, hundreds of responses came forth. Some helpers, like Dr. W.C. Minor, provided literally thousands of entries to the editors. But Minor, an American expatriate in England and a Civil War veteran, was actually a certified lunatic who turned in his dictionary entries from the Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum. Simon Winchester has produced a mesmerizing coda to the deeply troubled Minor's life, a life that in one sense began with the senseless murder of an innocent British brewery worker that the deluded Minor believed was an assassin sent by one of his numerous &quot;enemies.&quot;Winchester also paints a rich portrait of the OED's leading light, Professor James Murray, who spent more than 40 years of his life on a project he would not see completed in his lifetime. Winchester traces the origins of the drive to create a &quot;Big Dictionary&quot; down through Murray and far back into the past; the result is a fascinating compact history of the English language (albeit admittedly more interesting to linguistics enthusiasts than historians or true crime buffs). That Murray and Minor, whose lives took such wildly disparate turns yet were united in their fierce love of language, were able to view one another as peers and foster a warm friendship is just one of the delicately turned subplots of this compelling book.--Tjames Madison",

Now their food is almost gone, and in their desperation and fear, the young people are beginning to sort themselves into factions; those without special powers opposing those who have them.

Their father is a charismatic detective for the San Francisco Police Department who has been chronically unfaithful to his wife, which has led to their divorce. Their emotionally fragile mother is severely depressed and spends a lot of time in her bedroom.

        "0099908506": "The Sun Also Risesfirst appeared in 1926, and yet it's as fresh and clean and fine as it ever was, maybe finer. Hemingway's famously plain declarative sentences linger in the mind like poetry: \"Brett was damned good-looking. She wore a slipover jersey sweater and a tweed skirt, and her hair was brushed back like a boy's. She started all that.\" His cast of thirtysomething dissolute expatriates--Brett and her drunken fianc&eacute;, Mike Campbell, the unhappy Princeton Jewish boxer Robert Cohn, the sardonic novelist Bill Gorton--are as familiar as the \"cool crowd\" we all once knew. No wonder this quintessential lost-generation novel has inspired several generations of imitators, in style as well as lifestyle.Jake Barnes, Hemingway's narrator with a mysterious war wound that has left him sexually incapable, is the heart and soul of the book. Brett, the beautiful, doomed English woman he adores, provides the glamour of natural chic and sexual unattainability. Alcohol and post-World War I anomie fuel the plot: weary of drinking and dancing in Paris caf&eacute;s, the expatriate gang decamps for the Spanish town of Pamplona for the \"wonderful nightmare\" of a week-long fiesta. Brett, with fianc&eacute; and ex-lover Cohn in tow, breaks hearts all around until she falls, briefly, for the handsome teenage bullfighter Pedro Romero. \"My God! he's a lovely boy,\" she tells Jake. \"And how I would love to see him get into those clothes.

Kurt Wallander, who has just returned from an idyllic vacation in Rome, joins the hunt for the missing Holger Eriksson, an elderly poet. Finding the man's corpse in a ditch, impaled on sharpened bamboo stakes, brings Wallander back abruptly to the realities of crime in modern Sweden. While Wallander and his colleagues investigate the murder, another man is found dead in the local woods, making it clear that they have a brutal serial killer on their hands. The killer plans each murder carefully to ensure that the victim suffers for several days before dying. Who could hate these innocent-seeming men so much as to want to torture them to death? The police detectives must delve deeply into the victims' lives to find out what links them together and what might have made them a deadly enemy. Mankell takes the reader slowly and meticulously through the long investigation's progress, including frequent reversals. The policemen are constantly overworked and exhausted, but they make acute deductions and chase down every lead relentlessly. Mankell is a talented writer, and the translation by Steven Murray is graceful and colloquial, but the narrative is so bleak and brooding that it certainly qualifies as the darkest of Swedish noir.

It is&mdash;deep breath now&mdash;a murder-mystery speculative-history Jewish-identity noir chess thriller, so perhaps it's no surprise that, in the back half of the book, the moving parts become unwieldy; Chabon is juggling narrative chainsaws here.The novel begins&mdash;the same way that Philip Roth launchedThe Plot Against America&mdash;with a fascinating historical footnote: what if, as Franklin Roosevelt proposed on the eve of World War II, a temporary Jewish settlement had been established on the Alaska panhandle? Roosevelt's plan went nowhere, but Chabon runs the idea into the present, back-loading his tale with a haunting history. Israel failed to get a foothold in the Middle East, and since the Sitka solution was only temporary, Alaskan Jews are about to lose their cold homeland. The book's timeless refrain: \"It's a strange time to be a Jew.\"Into this world arrives Chabon's Chandler-ready hero, Meyer Landsman, a drunken rogue cop who wakes in a flophouse to find that one of his neighbors has been murdered. With his half-Tlingit, half-Jewish partner and his sexy-tough boss, who happens also to be his ex-wife, Landsman investigates a fascinating underworld of Orthodox black-hat gangs and crime-lord rabbis. Chabon's \"Alyeska\" is an act of fearless imagination, more evidence of the soaring talent of his previous genre-blender, the Pulitzer Prize&ndash;winningThe Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay.Eventually, however, Chabon's homage to noir feels heavy-handed, with too many scenes of snappy tough-guy banter and too much of the kind of elaborate thriller plotting that requires long explanations and offscreen conspiracies.Chabon can certainly write noir&mdash;or whatever else he wants; his recent Sherlock Holmes novel,The Final Solution, was lovely, even if theNew York Times Book Reviewsniffed its surprise that the mystery novel would \"appeal to the real writer.\" Should any other snobs mistake Chabon for anything less than a real writer, this book offers new evidence of his peerless storytelling and style. Characters have skin \"as pale as a page of commentary\" and rough voices \"like an onion rolling in a bucket.\" It's a solid performance that would have been even better with a little more Yiddish and a little less police.(May)Jess Walter was a finalist for the 2006 National Book Award forThe Zeroand the winner of the 2006 Edgar Award for best novel forCitizen Vince.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

John Irving's novel, which inspired the 1998 Jim Carrey movieSimon Birch, is his most popular book in Britain, and perhaps the oddest Christian mystic novel sinceFlannery O'Connor's work. Irving fans will find much that is familiar: the New England prep-school-town setting, symbolic amputations of man and beast, theGarp-like unknown father of the narrator (Owen's orphaned best friend), the rough comedy. The scene of doltish the doltish headmaster driving a trashed VW down the school's marble staircase is a marvelous set piece. So are the Christmas pageants Owen stars in. But it's all, asHighlightsmagazine used to put it, \"fun with a purpose.\"  When Owen plays baby Jesus in the pageants, and glimpses a tombstone with his death date while enactingA Christmas Carol, the slapstick doesn't cancel the fact that hewasborn to be martyred. The book's countless subplots add up to a moral argument, specifically an indictment of American foreign policy--from Vietnam to the Contras.The book's mystic religiosity is steeped in Robertson Davies'sDeptford trilogy, and the fatal baseball relates to the fatefully misdirected snowball in the first Deptford novel,Fifth Business. Tiny, symbolic Owen echoes the hero of Irving's teacher G&uuml;nter Grass'sThe Tin Drum--the two characters share the same initials.

Yet when Serena learns that she will never bear a child, she sets out to murder the son George fathered without her. Mother and child begin a struggle for their lives, and when Serena suspects George is protecting his illegitimate family, the Pembertons' intense, passionate marriage starts to unravel as the story moves toward its shocking reckoning.Rash's masterful balance of violence and beauty yields a riveting novel that, at its core, tells of love both honored and betrayed.The Gift of Silence: An Essay by Ron RashWhen readers ask how I came to be a writer, I usually mention several influences: my parents&#x2019; teaching by example the importance of reading; a grandfather who, though illiterate, was a wonderful storyteller; and, as I grew older, an awareness that my region had produced an inordinate number of excellent writers and that I might find a place in that tradition.  Nevertheless, I believe what most made me a writer was my early difficulty with language.My mother tells me that certain words were impossible for me to pronounce, especially those with j&#x2019;s and g&#x2019;s.  Those hard consonants were like tripwires in my mouth, causing me to stumble over words such as &#x201C;jungle&#x201D; and &#x201C;generous.&#x201D;  My parents hoped I would grow out of this problem, but by the time I was five, I&#x2019;d made no improvement.  There was no speech therapist in the county, but one did drive in from the closest city once a week.That once a week was a Saturday morning at the local high school.  For an hour the therapist worked with me.  I don&#x2019;t remember much of what we did in those sessions, except that several times she held my hands to her face as she pronounced a word.  I do remember how large and empty the classroom seemed with just the two of us in it, and how small I felt sitting in a desk made for teenagers.I improved, enough so that by summer&#x2019;s end the therapist said I needed no further sessions.  I still had trouble with certain words (one that bedevils me even today is &#x201C;gesture&#x201D;), but not enough that when I entered first grade my classmates and teacher appeared to notice.  Nevertheless, certain habits of silence had taken hold.  It was not just self-consciousness.  Even before my sessions with the speech therapist, I had convinced myself that if I listened attentively enough to others my own tongue would be able to mimic their words.  So I listened more than I spoke.  I became comfortable with silence, and, not surprisingly, spent a lot of time alone wandering nearby woods and creeks.  I entertained myself with stories I made up, transporting myself into different places, different selves.  I was in training to be a writer, though of course at that time I had yet to write more than my name.Yet my most vivid memory of that summer is not the Saturday morning sessions at the high school but one night at my grandmother&#x2019;s farmhouse. After dinner, my parents, grandmother and several other older relatives gathered on the front porch.  I sat on the steps as the night slowly enveloped us, listening intently as their tongues set free words I could not master.  Then it appeared. A bright-green moth big as an adult&#x2019;s hand fluttered over my head and onto the porch, drawn by the light filtering through the screen door.  The grown-ups quit talking as it brushed against the screen, circled overhead, and disappeared back into the night.  It was a luna moth, I learned later, but in my mind that night it became indelibly connected to the way I viewed language--something magical that I grasped at but that was just out of reach.In first grade, I began learning that loops and lines made from lead and ink could be as communicative as sound. Now, almost five decades later, language, spoken or written, is no longer out of reach, but it remains just as magical as that bright-green moth.  What writer would wish it otherwise.",
        "0061147931": "Do you sleep with the light on? Are you in the habit of checking your doors and windows before you go to bed? Maybe even checkingunderyour bed? If you are about to crack open Joe Hill's chilling thrillerHeart-Shaped Box, you might want to rethink your nighttime habits--Hill's story about an aging rock star (with a penchant for macabre artifacts) who buys a haunted suit online will scare you silly. But don't take our word for it. We asked bestselling authors (and masters of dark terror tales themselves)Scott Smith, andHarlan Cobento readHeart-Shaped Boxand give us their take. Check out their reviews below, and you might want to pick up anightlightwhile you're at it.--Daphne DurhamGuest Reviewer: Scott SmithIn 1993, Scott Smith wowed readers with his stunning debut thriller,A Simple Plan.  Thirteen years later, he spooked us again withThe Ruins, a horror-thriller about four Americans traveling in Mexico who stumble across a nightmare in the jungle.The set-up for Joe Hill's novel,Heart-Shaped Box, is appealingly simple. Jude Coyne, an aging rock star, buys himself a dead man's suit. He acquires it online, lured by the promise that the dead man's ghost will be included in his purchase. Jude thinks this is a joke, of course. He also assumes the seller is a stranger. We soon discover that he's wrong on both counts, however, and from this point on the story moves with an exhilarating urgency. Jude wants the ghost gone; the ghost wants Jude dead. We watch, chapter-by-chapter, as they battle for survival. \"Watch\" is the appropriate word, too, because this is an extremely visual book. Hill's prose is lean and precise, and he renders Jude's world with impressive confidence. It feels solid, every detail both correct and fresh. And this physicality provides a firm platform for the book's otherworldly happenings, which seem all the more frightening for being so securely grounded.Hill has a flawless sense of pacing. His narrative never flags, nor does it ever move so quickly as to outrun itself. And one can sense his literary ambition pushing at the margins of the genre. There are times when his writing, for all its spare efficiency, seems to jump away from him, stopping one small step short of poetry. An e-mail to Jude from the ghost (trust me, it's not as absurd as it sounds) could even pass for something ee cummings might've written, in an especially morbid mood. And toward the end of the book, when Hill describes a trip down death's \"night road\" in a '65 Mustang, the passage has a startlingly lyrical beauty.The story's horror ultimately has as much to do with Jude Coyne's past--his mistakes, abandonments and betrayals--as with anything supernatural. Jude has caused a lot of pain over the years, moving through life with a carelessness that verges on the callous. His battle with the ghost brings this behavior into sharp relief, forcing him to reflect upon his own capacity for cruelty. This dawning self-awareness leavens the book's bleakness and gore (and it is delightfully gory in places) with an unexpected sweetness. Despite our initial impression, Jude is gradually revealed--both to himself and the reader--as an essentially decent, even kind man. It's this kindness, this fledgling ability to love and be loved, that will ultimately be of crucial consequence in his death struggle with the ghost. And it's what makes Hill's debut not only well-written and terrifying, but also--as it draws to its close--surprisingly moving. So go ahead, take a chance, and open hisHeart-Shaped Box. I think you&#x92;ll be happy you did.--Scott SmithGuest Reviewer: Harlan CobenHarlan Cobenis the author of the belovedMyron Bolitarseries about a wisecracking sports agent, as well as stunning stand-alone novels likeThe Innocentand his breakout thrillerTell No One. His new novelThe Woodsreleases on April 17, 2007.You, dear reader, are obviously somewhat versed in making online purchases, so today, immediately after you click on the yellow \"Add to Shopping Cart\" on the top right hand corner of this page, why not do an online search and buy something totally unique?Like, say, a vengeful ghost.That is what rock-star Judas Coyne does, thinking it will be a laugh, fun for his \"sick-o\" collection of such things. It seems a random buy, but Judas soon learns that it is anything but. This particular ghost is one Craddock McDermott, step-father to recent suicide victim and boy, is he cranky. He demands revenge for his step-daughter&#x92;s death, which he blames on Judas&#x92;s shabby treatment of her.Or is he after something else?There are Amazon readers who will give you a better plot summary. Don't read them too closely because Joe Hill provides plenty of fun surprises.Heart-Shaped Boxis a true spine-tingler.  I don&#x92;t use that hyphenated word much anymore. We have seen and read it all, haven't we?  But right away, in the first chapter, there was a subtle line that made the hairs on the back of my neck go up in a way I haven't experienced since I first discovered great horror as a teenager.Hill writes with a sure hand. The prose is compelling. Like most memorable tales of horror, this book is more about redemption than scary moments--thoughHeart-Shaped Boxhas plenty of scares. They are visceral, shocking and very well done. The characters are flawed and real. The father-son relationship adds texture and surprising poignancy.So here's the thing. My guess is, you won&#x92;t find a ghost to buy online, but if you read theHeart-Shaped Box, you will be getting something that will haunt you and startle you and stay with you and yes, visit you in your dreams.Sleep well, dear reader.--Harlan Coben",

Their misfortunes begin one gray day on Briny Beach when Mr. Poe tells them that their parents perished in a fire that destroyed their whole house. \"It is useless for me to describe to you how terrible Violet, Klaus, and even Sunny felt in the time that followed,\" laments the personable (occasionally pedantic) narrator, who tells the story as if his readers are gathered around an armchair on pillows. But of course what follows is dreadful. The children thought it was bad when the well-meaning Poes bought them grotesque-colored clothing that itched. But when they are ushered to the dilapidated doorstep of the miserable, thin, unshaven, shiny-eyed, money-grubbing Count Olaf, they know that they--and their family fortune--are in real trouble. Still, they could never have anticipated how much trouble. While it's true that the events that unfold in Lemony Snicket's novels are bleak, and things never turn out as you'd hope, these delightful, funny, linguistically playful books are reminiscent of Roald Dahl (rememberJames and the Giant Peachand his horrid spinster aunts), Charles Dickens (the orphaned Pip inGreat Expectationswithout the mysterious benefactor), and Edward Gorey (The Gashlycrumb Tinies).

His search for his wife  (and his cat) introduces him to a bizarre collection of characters, including two psychic sisters, a possibly unbalanced teenager, an old soldier who witnessed the massacres on the Chinese mainland at the beginning of the Second World War, and a very shady politician.Haruki Murakami is a master of subtly disturbing prose. Mundane events throb with menace, while the bizarre is accepted without comment. Meaning always seems to be just out of reach, for the reader as well as for the characters, yet one is drawn inexorably into a mystery that may have no solution.The Wind-Up Bird Chronicleis an extended meditation on themes that appear throughout Murakami's earlier work. The tropes of popular culture, movies, music, detective stories, combine to create a work that explores both the surface and the hidden depths of Japanese society at the end of the 20th century.If it were possible to isolate one theme inThe Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, that theme would be responsibility. The atrocities committed by the Japanese army in China keep rising to the surface like a repressed memory, and Toru Okada himself is compelled by events to take responsibility for his actions and struggle with his essentially passive nature. If Toru is supposed to be a Japanese Everyman, steeped as he is in Western popular culture and ignorant of the secret history of his own nation, this novel paints a bleak picture. Like the winding up of the titular bird, Murakami slowly twists the gossamer threads of his story into something of considerable weight.--Simon Leake--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",
        "B000066TS5": "Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins",

At issue is the zero point field, the so-called \"dead space\" of microscopic vibrations in outer space as well as within and between physical objects on earth. These fields, McTaggart asserts, are a \"cobweb of energy exchange\" that link everything in the universe; they control everything from cellular communication to the workings of the mind, and they could be harnessed for unlimited propulsion fuel, levitation, ESP, spiritual healing and more. Physicists have been aware of the likelihood of this field for years, McTaggart writes, but, constrained by orthodoxy, they have ignored its effects, which she likens to \"subtracting out God\" from their equations. But, McTaggart asserts, \"tiny pockets of quiet rebellion\" against scientific convention are emerging, led by Ed Mitchell, an Apollo 14 astronaut and founder of the Institute for Noetic Sciences, an alternative-science think tank. McTaggart writes well and tells a good story, but the supporting data here is somewhat sketchy.

        "0007230206": "Amazon Best of the Month, October 2009:No character in the canon has been writ larger than Henry VIII, but that didn't stop Hilary Mantel. She strides through centuries, past acres of novels, histories, biographies, and plays--even past Henry himself--confident in the knowledge that to recast history's most mercurial sovereign, it's not the King she needs to see, but one of the King's most mysterious agents. Enter Thomas Cromwell, a self-made man and remarkable polymath who ascends to the King's right hand. Rigorously pragmatic and forward-thinking, Cromwell has little interest in what motivates his Majesty, and although he makes way for Henry's marriage to the infamous Anne Boleyn, it's the future of a free England that he honors above all else and hopes to secure. Mantel plots with a sleight of hand, making full use of her masterful grasp on the facts without weighing down her prose. The opening cast of characters and family trees may give initial pause to some readers, but persevere: the witty, whip-smart lines volleying the action forward may convince you a short stay in the Tower of London might not be so bad... provided you could bring a copy ofWolf Hallalong. --Anne Bartholomew--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

But the focus here is less on Decker and his wife, Rina Lazarus, than on Gabe Whitman, the son of a friend who&#x2019;s living with them temporarily. Gabe, a 15-year-old musical prodigy, also has street smarts learned from his mobster father, Chris Donatti, that stand him in good stead when he&#x2019;s &#x201C;crowded&#x201D; and threatened by the clique called the B&amp;W Mafia. Home-schooled Gabe also falls head-over-heels in love with 14-year-old Yasmine Nourmand. While the reciprocal relationship is grounded in love of music (plus raging hormones), it appears doomed by cultural and religious differences. Plot threads intertwine head-on in a violent confrontation, eventually tying up most loose ends extremely satisfactorily. The twentieth Decker/Lazarus novel shows Kellerman in fine form, taking on the au courant issue of bullying, in a slick, fast-moving mystery that should entice even those new to the series.

She opened the door a crack and saw a young woman standing there in her raincoat, her bare legs spattered with dried mud, holding a crying baby wrapped in a blanket. The baby was Heidi, and they had come from the almost-empty apartment next door for help. Heidi's Mama can't tend her week-old child because she has, as Heidi later says, \"a bum brain,\" so Bernadette steps in and cares for them both tenderly. Mama says her name is \"So Be It,\" but with her twenty-three-word vocabulary, this is all the information she can give Bernadette.Twelve years later this strange but loving household is still together. Heidi does the shopping because Bernadette has \"angora phobia,\" and pays for it with money she wins at the laundromat; Bernadette teaches her at the kitchen table while Mama is happily occupied with her coloring books, and the rent and utilities are always mysteriously paid. But Heidi wonders who she is, where she and Mama came from, why they were alone, and most of all, she wants to know the meaning of Mama's word \"soof.\" When she finds some old photos in a cupboard, she knows where to go to find out, and as she sets out on a long cross-country bus journey, the pieces of the puzzle begin to fall into surprising places in this intriguing and heartwarming mystery.

        "0099526832": "David Lurie is hardly the hero of his own life, or anyone else's. At 52, the protagonist ofDisgraceis at the end of his professional and romantic game, and seems to be deliberately courting disaster. Long a professor of modern languages at Cape Town University College, he has recently been relegated to adjunct professor of communications at the same institution, now pointedly renamed Cape Technical University:Although he devotes hours of each day to his new discipline, he finds its first premise, as enunciated in the Communications 101 handbook, preposterous: \"Human society has created language in order that we may communicate our thoughts, feelings and intentions to each other.\" His own opinion, which he does not air, is that the origins of speech lie in song, and the origins of song in the need to fill out with sound the overlarge and rather empty human soul.Twice married and twice divorced, his magnetic looks on the wane, David rather cruelly seduces one of his students, and his conduct unbecoming is soon uncovered. In his eighth novel, J.M. Coetzee might have been content to write a searching academic satire. But inDisgracehe is intent on much more, and his art is as uncompromising as his main character, though infinitely more complex. Refusing to play the public-repentance game, David gets himself fired--a final gesture of contempt. Now, he thinks, he will write something on Byron's last years. Not empty, unread criticism, \"prose measured by the yard,\" but a libretto. To do so, he heads for the Eastern Cape and his daughter's farm. In her mid-20s, Lucy has turned her back on city sophistications: with five hectares, she makes her living by growing flowers and produce and boarding dogs. \"Nothing,\" David thinks, \"could be more simple.\" But nothing, in fact, is more complicated--or, in the new South Africa, more dangerous. Far from being the refuge he has sought, little is safe in Salem. Just as David has settled into his temporary role as farmworker and unenthusiastic animal-shelter volunteer, he and Lucy are attacked by three black men. Unable to protect his daughter, David's disgrace is complete. Hers, however, is far worse.There is much more to be explored in Coetzee's painful novel, and few consolations. It would be easy to pick up on his title and viewDisgraceas a complicated working-out of personal and political shame and responsibility. But the author is concerned with his country's history, brutalities, and betrayals. Coetzee is also intent on what measure of soul and rights we allow animals. After the attack, David takes his role at the shelter more seriously, at last achieving an unlikely home and some measure of love. In Coetzee's recent Princeton lectures,The Lives of Animals, an aging novelist tells her audience that the question that occupies all lab and zoo creatures is, \"Where is home, and how do I get there?\" David, though still all-powerful compared to those he helps dispose of, is equally trapped, equally lost.Disgraceis almost willfully plain. Yet it possesses its own lean, heartbreaking lyricism, most of all in its descriptions of unwanted animals. At the start of the novel, David tells his student that poetry either speaks instantly to the reader--\"a flash of revelation and a flash of response\"--or not at all. Coetzee's book speaks differently, its layers and sadnesses endlessly unfolding.--Kerry Fried--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

        "0020519109": "Here, for a change, is a fish tale that actually does honor to the  author. In factThe Old Man and the Searevived Ernest Hemingway's career, which was foundering under the weight of such postwar stinkers asAcross the River and into the Trees. It also led directly to his receipt of the Nobel Prize in 1954 (an award Hemingway gladly accepted, despite his earlier observation that \"no son of a bitch that ever won the Nobel Prize ever wrote anything worth reading afterwards\"). A half century later, it's still easy to see why. This tale of an aged Cuban fisherman going head-to-head (or hand-to-fin) with a magnificent marlin encapsulates Hemingway's favorite motifs of physical and moral challenge. Yet Santiago is too old and infirm to partake of the gun-toting machismo that disfigured much of the author's later work: \"The brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its reflection on the tropic sea were on his cheeks. The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords.\" Hemingway's style, too, reverts to those superb snapshots of perception that won him his initial fame:Just before it was dark, as they passed a great island of Sargasso weed that heaved and swung in the light sea as though the ocean were making love with something under a yellow blanket, his small line was taken by a dolphin. He saw it first when it jumped in the air, true gold in the last of the sun and bending and flapping wildly in the air.If a younger Hemingway had written this novella, Santiago most likely would have towed the enormous fish back to port and posed for a triumphal photograph--just as the author delighted in doing, circa 1935. Instead his prize gets devoured by a school of sharks. Returning with little more than a skeleton, he takes to his bed and, in the very last line, cements his identification with his creator: \"The old man was dreaming about the lions.\" Perhaps there's some allegory of art and experience floating around in there somewhere--butThe Old Man and the Seawas, in any case, the last great catch of Hemingway's career.--James Marcus--This text refers to an alternatePaperbackedition.",

Now he's unemployed and is finally  starting to enjoy his new role as stay-at-home dad. All would be domestic bliss  if it were not for Jack's suspicions that his wife, who's been behaving  strangely and working long hours at the top-secret research labs of Xymos  Technology, is having an affair. When he's called in to help with her hush-hush  project, it seems like the perfect opportunity to see what his wife's been  doing, but Jack quickly finds there's a lot more going on in the lab than an  illicit affair. Within hours of his arrival at the remote testing center, Jack  discovers his wife's firm has created self-replicating nanotechnology--a literal  swarm of microscopic machines. Originally meant to serve as a military eye in  the sky, the swarm has now escaped into the environment and is seemingly intent  on killing the scientists trapped in the facility. The reader realizes early,  however, that Jack, his wife, and fellow scientists have more to fear from the  hidden dangers within the lab than from the predators without.The monsters may be smaller in this book, but Crichton's skill for suspense has  grown, makingPreya scary read that's hard to set aside, though not  without its minor flaws. The science in this novel requires more explanation  than did the cloning of dinosaurs, leading to lengthy and sometimes dry academic  lessons. And while the coincidence of Xymos's new technology running on the same  program Jack created at his previous job keeps the plot moving, it may be more  than some readers can swallow.

It's aDungeons & Dragonscomputer game, as well as all the tools you'll need to create your own Dungeons & Dragons adventures.Neverwinter Nightsis an achievement. It accomplishes what computer role-playing games set out to do when Wizardry debuted in the late '70s: re-create the social, hands-on experience of tabletop gaming.Neverwinter Nightsuses the Dungeons & Dragons 3rd Edition rules in (nearly) all their complex glory. It's the first game to attempt to fully support D&D; 3E's customizable features, and more significantly, it's the first game designed to re-create the experience of playing tabletop D&D.; You can play BioWare's extensive campaign alone or online with your friends, or you can use the included Aurora toolset to build your own adventure module and run it for your buddies with all the control you'd have if you were running a tabletop game. The powerful Dungeon Master client lets you put words in nonplayer characters' mouths, control monsters, alter the game world, and customize your adventure on the fly. If playing is your thing, you can join other people's games and play through encounters with other gamers around the world.Everything works as it should and the game is beautiful to behold. BioWare has used a limited 3-D engine to allow you to spin your viewpoint around your character and zoom in on the action. During combat, Mages unleash spectacular spells, Priests raise their symbols to drive undead hordes back, and Rogues tinker with locked chests, while Fighters dodge, parry, and strike ferociously at any attacking beasts. The sound is topnotch, with BioWare's typically high-quality voice acting and music from composer Jeremy Soule.But all isn't perfect.The game makes a great effort of implementing the full D&D; 3rd Edition rules, but doesn't quite succeed. InNWN, Paladins lose their Detect Evil and Mount abilities. Druids can shape change into animals, but can't change back to human form at will. Darkvision has no noticeable in-game effect. Troublesome issues for hard-core D&D; fans, but it's understandable that some changes would have to be made in order to shoehorn a freeform tabletop RPG into a computer program.Other issues are not so easy to understand: the camera controls are simple and will not allow the user to lower to decrease the camera angle--you'll never get anything approaching a character's-eye view of the world. Moving to a new section within a building or going from an indoor to an outdoor area takes you out of the game and presents you with a (mercifully short) \"Loading\" screen. There is an artificial limitation on how many henchmen you can hire in the single-player game: you're limited to one hireling, andBaldur's Gatefans will miss the squabbling party from earlier games. More significant are the problems that arise from trying to re-create a social experience like D&D; in a computer game. Multiplayer games with strangers are confusing and not as fun as they sound and, like the tabletop game, they're really only as fun as the players and especially the DM you're playing with. MultiplayerNWNis only worthwhile if you have a dedicated group and a DM that knows what he or she is doing. The last drawback is the documentation. The manual is large and detailed but it omits key help in module creation; you have to buy a separatestrategy guideif you want that information.But though slightly flawed,NWNhas indisputably won the holy grail of RPG gaming: getting the Dungeons & Dragons experience into a personal computer. The included campaign is fascinating and the tools are powerful enough to ensure a steady stream of module content from devoted fans. Make no mistake,Neverwinter Nightsis an achievement and will likely change the way CRPGs are played from now on. It's a game no RPG fan, no D&D; fan, should miss.--Bob AndrewsPros:Almost perfect implementation of D&D; 3E rulesDeep single-player gameIntriguing multiplayer gamePowerful module creation toolsCons:Not quite perfect implementation of D&D; 3E rules\"Loading\" screensInflexible 3-D cameraOnly one henchmanMultiplayer is dependant on quality players and DM",

When Link travels to the Twilight Realm, he transforms into a wolf and must scour the land with the help of a mysterious girl named Midna. Besides his trusty sword and shield, Link will use his bow and arrows by aiming with the Wii Remote controller, fight while on horseback and use a wealth of other items, both new and old.The most epic Zelda ever launches with the Wii.Link roams an entirely new land of Hyrule.View larger.Take control of your trusty horse as you travel from quest to quest.View larger.Link must solve a number of challenging puzzles to progress to boss battles.View larger.Fishing with the Wii Remote is a fun and worthwhile diversion.View larger.Link's journeys, reinventedHailed by many as the best Zelda game since 1998'sOcarina of Time,Twilight Princessthrusts players into a troubled world ravaged by a dangerous magic. Sporting a new, more realistic visual style than the previous Zelda title, Link looks much more like an adult than in previous installments and fits well into an environment that provides Zelda fans with a much more gritty and grim environment to explore. The entirety of the quest fits this darker mood, as both Link and NPC's alike share the same concern for the changes about in Hyrule.More than just a spiritual successor to previous Zelda installments,Twilight Princessoffers players a new way of controlling Link through dungeons, forests, towns, and the bizarre Twilight Realm: precise weapon controls with the Wii remote! Players can use the remote to control Links' weapons including the sword, arrows, and boomerang. This new control scheme allows for much faster and more accurate control than on previous Nintendo hardware. For example, waving the remote in the air will result in Link performing the same move with the sword. To fire off on arrow, players \"pull back\" on a virtual controller string as the Wii remote's speaker lets players know that the projectile is ready for release. It all works incredibly well and adds to the title's immersion and style- you feel more in the center of the action than in previous Zelda games.As impressive as the new control scheme is, the scope and size of the new land of the Hyrule is equally as impressive- truly the Wii's first epic adventure. Beautifully crafted and four years in the making, the land players travel through is vast and diverse as the dungeons and monsters that lie within. As players collect triforce pieces from the distant sections of the continent, they will get to know many different villages and foes. Thankfully, Link will be able to move over long stretches of land faster thanks to \"Epona,\" your faithful horse. Epona also helps Link become a more effective fighter, as a number of powerful and impressive sword strikes can be launched while galloping through fields of enemies.The Twilight Realm awaitsLike most games in the Zelda franchise, Link begins his adventure with little more than the clothes he has on an an inkling that something has gone awry. After an initial trip to the Twilight Realm, in which Link appears as a wolf, a friendly shadow dweller named Midna will meet up with players and give helpful advice on gameplay. Fortunately for players, this virtual assistant spells out ways to be a more effective adventurer in and out of the shadow world. Early stages of the game have Link spending a lot of time in the Twilight Realm, and outdoor areas of Hyrule, attempting to clear areas of the strange darkness that has seemingly fallen over every village, forest, and field. As the story progresses, players will learn the cause of the shadows, and what they must to do vanquish them for good.Puzzling puzzlesLink once again finds himself in a number of classic Zelda-esque puzzle scenarios in which he must light torches to unlock doors, raise and lower water levels, and fight enemies to collect keys and open chests for valuable rupees. A number of the dungeons present unique puzzle challenges that rely on the player's ability to hone their Wii remote's control, such as an air castle in the sky that can only be accessed by an extremely accurate grappling hook toss.In general,Twilight Princessis more challenging than the average Zelda game, with a number of boss battles having protracted hit sequences with little support potions about, and even less warning. Still, there's never been an adventure experience such as this, wherein players can literally charge at a dungeon boss with their fists and punch the air to defeat an enormous foe. As the finest Zelda experience in almost ten years and the game fans have been waiting for,Twilight Princesswill delight young and old gamers alike.",

Though Horowitz is a cofounder of Andreessen Horowitz and his credentials reside mainly in Silicon Valley, he&#x2019;s imparted some valuable insight on hard lessons learned that apply to any manager, whether in the executive suite or not. As with most experiential books, it is all about him&#x2014;but it&#x2019;s written in such an engaging and universally acceptable manner that no one could object. Leave aside his background, for the moment. Who would realize, for instance, that executives worry about things like initiating layoffs, hiring the right people, training, and minimizing politics, among others? It&#x2019;s a refreshingly honest take, and his colorful (and, yes, profanity-laced) language breaks down any other misperceptions about the role and the person. Plus, his imagination is compelling, such as the comparisons between peacetime and wartime CEOs: Peacetime CEO always has a contingency plan. Wartime CEO knows that sometimes you gotta roll a hard six. After all, the success equation is easy: the hard thing is getting it done. --Barbara Jacobs",

Hill, the son of horror master Stephen King, runs a diverse gamut that includes some unapologetic chillers along the lines of the book's title story. Yet the essence of his material could best be described as a hybrid that connects the ironic twists from episodes ofThe Twilight Zonewith the angst and vulnerability of childhood and adolescence. David LeDoux, whose previous audiobook credits include Douglas Coupland'sHey Nostradamus!and Sara Gruen'sWater for Elephants, demonstrates an especially keen knack for capturing the cadence of teen and young adult male speech patterns, with equal parts deadpan cool and quivering tension. Hill's novella Voluntary Committal provides a sublime experience of jarring suspense and compelling family drama. Admittedly, a few of the briefer works may leave listeners longing for more fully developed story lines, but Hill consistently manages to evoke emotional responses and provoke unsettling questions, which makes for a worthwhile experience.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

All that remains is the search for the truth behind his betrayal and the survival of its consequences.The StoryDeceived by the forces of evil into prematurely bringing about the end of the world, War - the first Horseman of the Apocalypse - stands accused of breaking the sacred law by inciting a war between heaven and hell. Dishonored and stripped of his powers, War must return to Earth to search for the truth and punish those responsible. But there is no clear definition of good and evil in this tale. Hunted by a vengeful group of angels, War must take on the forces of Hell, forge uneasy alliances with the very demons he hunts, and journey across the ravaged remains of the Earth on his quest for vindication. But the answers he seeks will reveal a deep conspiracy in which War will find, and have to resign himself to the reality that although once the hand of God, he is just a pawn in the eternal battle between heaven and hell.GameplayA mix of exploration and fast-paced action gameplay,Darksidersis based on nonlinear play situations. That means that as War slowly regains his previous powers of destruction and carnage in order to continue his search for the origins and reasons for his betrayal, players will be able to backtrack to areas and scenarios that they may have left unexplored upon first discovery. Almost all areas of the game can be explored and some of the things players will find as they do so are treasure chests, health chests, and bonus life points, etc. The ability to go back and explore areas is important, especially as the game progresses and War finds himself up against enemies whose defeat require special skills and/or weaponry.As for combat gameplay,Darksidersfeatures a variety of weapons--including blades and firearms--that can be used in combo moves or in single strikes. Some of these can be charged up for quick, but devastating attacks on enemies and all can be arranged on your controller's D-pad for easy and preferred access. Additional gameplay elements include the ability/necessity to fight from the back of your mount, Ruin, and the collection of the souls in the form of glowing orbs that fall to the ground as enemies are dispatched.

        "006202468X": "Product DescriptionPrue McKeel&rsquo;s life is ordinary. At least until her baby brother is abducted by a murder of crows. And then things get really weird.You see, on every map of Portland, Oregon, there is a big splotch of green on the edge of the city labeled &ldquo;I.W.&rdquo; This stands for &ldquo;Impassable Wilderness.&rdquo; No one&rsquo;s ever gone in&mdash;or at least returned to tell of it.And this is where the crows take her brother.So begins an adventure that will take Prue and her friend Curtis deep into the Impassable Wilderness. There they uncover a secret world in the midst of violent upheaval, a world full of warring creatures, peaceable mystics, and powerful figures with the darkest intentions. And what begins as a rescue mission becomes something much bigger as the two friends find themselves entwined in a struggle for the very freedom of this wilderness.A wilderness the locals call Wildwood.Wildwoodis a spellbinding tale full of wonder, danger, and magic that juxtaposes the thrill of a secret world and modern city life. Original and fresh yet steeped in classic fantasy, this is a novel that could have only come from the imagination of Colin Meloy, celebrated for his inventive and fantastic storytelling as the lead singer of the Decemberists. With dozens of intricate and beautiful illustrations by award-winning artist Carson Ellis,Wildwoodis truly a new classic for the twenty-first century.AWildwoodPlaylist by Colin Meloy &amp; Carson Ellis\"Ramble On\"by Led ZeppelinColin Meloy: I remember reading an interview with Evan Dando from the Lemonheads right around the time the first Lord of the Rings movie came out, bemoaning the fact that the director hadn&rsquo;t included asingleZeppelin song in the movie. I tend to agree; I mean, how rad would it&rsquo;ve been after that dramatic ending inThe Return of the King, with all its royal celebrations and slo-mo montages&mdash;the screen goes black and those monster riffs of &ldquo;Immigrant Song&rdquo; kick in? Mind-blowing. So much incredible music in the 60s and 70s was directly fueled by mid-century fantasy fiction, something thatWildwoodowes much to; I feel it would be deeply remiss here not to include a little Zepp.\"Marching Song\"by Esben and the WitchColin Meloy: That said, when I was deep in my preadolescent reverie of fantasy and sci-fi, my friends and I would meet every weekend at someone&rsquo;s house to play Dungeons &amp; Dragons. There. Confession made. And as everyone knows, the best Dungeon Masters always partnered up their biggest action scenarios with music. While I think it may have been de rigueur to blast Zeppelin or Hawkwind for some folks, I considered myself to be somewhat of a sophisticate. Joy Division was perfect music for a slow, suspenseful crawl through a gelatinous cube-infested grotto. The Legendary Pink Dots added an extra dimension to a party&rsquo;s first encounter with some weird, reclusive nemesis in a castle tower. An Enchantress might appear to &ldquo;Under Ice&rdquo; by Kate Bush or anything from Siouxsie&rsquo;s output. When I first heard this song from Brighton, England&rsquo;s Esben and the Witch (even the name is evocative of those days) I imagined a new generation of over-imaginative ten-year-olds pairing their fantastical ramblings with the drowning rains and empty plains of this song.\"Take It Easy\"by Hopeton LewisColin Meloy: Switching gears, here. Rocksteady, a kind of precursor to the reggae explosion of the 70s, was a beautiful, thoughtful, random amalgam of classic R&amp;B and traditional Jamaican rhythms. It&rsquo;s clearly the kind of music that is birthed out of necessity; a bunch of poor kids in the slums of Kingston figuring out for themselves how to re-create the sounds that they were hearing over crappy radio speakers: Sam Cooke, Ben E. King, and Sam &amp; Dave. And what came out wasn&rsquo;tquitethe same, but beautiful and weird and extraordinary in its own right. All this to say: I think that rocksteady music is the music of true enjoyment, the aural equivalent of a slice of bacon, and a rocksteady party was the kind of party I imagined Prue&rsquo;s parents would throw to celebrate Mac and Prue&rsquo;s joyful return. And I&rsquo;ll bet that Prue&rsquo;s dad dug deep for some Lewis sides&mdash;maybe he even had them on 45.\"Tam Lin\"by Fairport ConventionColin Meloy:  My 60s Brit Folk obsession is fairly well documented, but I thought I&rsquo;d be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t include an old folk song in this list. This one, in particular, features a forbidding forest and an evil fairy queen and a pair of star-crossed lovers. Clocking in just north of seven minutes, it&rsquo;s as immersive and complete a narrative as a song can hope to retell.\"Jar of Hearts\"by Christina PerriCarson Ellis: I love Sibylle Baier&rsquo;s mournful songs and I listened to them a lot when I was working onWildwood, especially during the rainy months. Portland winters can be dreary and sometimes gloomy music is the best thing for them. This isn&rsquo;t my very favorite song of hers, but I chose it because, you know, the title.\"I Lost Something in the Hills\"by Sibylle BaierCarson Ellis: The intensity and focused passion of this song makes me think of my darling Jack, along with the references to heaven and hell, a favorite theme of his.\"My Lovely Elizabeth\"by S.E. RogieCarson Ellis: Wildwood has a lot of illustrations&mdash;85 in all&mdash;and it was hard work getting them done. Man, I love to draw but at times this project was exhausting. At times it was downright grueling. Fortunately, I have some remedies for this: taking a walk always helps, as does yoga, as does S. E. Rogie.\"Katie Cruel\"by Karen DaltonCarson Ellis: This is a spooky traditional song that dates back to the Revolutionary War. LikeWildwood&rsquo;s villainess, Alexandra, Katie Cruel roams the forest and the &ldquo;bogs and mire,&rdquo; jilted and in exile. This is a good song to listen to while walking in Forest Park, the real woods that were the inspiration forWildwood&rsquo;s Impassable Wilderness. Or while walking in any misty, quiet forest where beards of moss hang from the gnarled branches of dead trees and there&rsquo;s little sign of civilization. You can imagine that around any bend you might find the solitary hut of Katie Cruel, a little curl of smoke drifting up from its chimney and the sound of her high lonesome banjo coming from within. I also love this song&rsquo;s beautiful, totally unhinged chorus:Oh that I was where I would be,Then I would be where I am not,Here I am where I must beGo where I would, I cannot.\"Over the Hills and Far Away\"by Led ZeppelinCarson Ellis: I&rsquo;m a longtime Led Zeppelin fan and this song, in addition to having a fitting title, was another one I loved when I was Prue&rsquo;s age. I first heard it around the time I read The Hobbit, and I thought its medieval vagabond vibe was awesome. I&rsquo;m also a sucker for a song that starts with a pretty guitar part and then gets crazy. As an adult I tend to like Zeppelin&rsquo;s earlier, bluesier stuff better but, as a kid, I loved the Middle Earth-ish stuff and &ldquo;Over the Hills and Far Away&rdquo; was my jam.A Look InsideWildwoodClick on the images below to open larger versions.

I was in the military from age seventeen as an ROTC cadet until I was a retired GI at age fifty-six. Others came from my service as Secretary of State and as National Security Advisor. Yet others came to me as I wandered through life. In this book I want to share with you a selection of these stories as well as experiences that have stayed with me over the years. Each one of them taught me something important about life and leadership. Some of the stories deal with serious aspects of my life, including some of the controversial issues I was involved in during my tenure as Secretary of State. There are also humorous stories from my life as well.  I offer them to you for whatever use you may wish to make of them.The first part ofIt Worked for Meexplains my Thirteen Rules, which have been bouncing around since they were first published inMagazineover twenty years ago. These are rules that I have gathered over the years and to which I&#x2019;ve adhered in my career.CLP's Thirteen Rules:It ain't as bad as you think. It will look better in the morning.Get mad, then get over it.Avoid having your ego so close to your position that when your position falls, your ego goes with it.It can be done!Be careful what you choose. You may get it.Don't let adverse facts stand in the way of a good decision.You can't make someone else's choices. You shouldn't let someone else make yours.Check small things.Share credit.Remain calm. Be kind.Have a vision. Be demanding.Don't take counsel of your fears or naysayers.Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier.The rest of the book focuses on everything from the importance of really knowing who you are and how to always be yourself to why I put an emphasis on knowing and taking care of others, especially those who are your followers. I go into my experience in the exploding digital realm that has reshaped the world and our lives. I talk about how to be a great manager and a great leader.  I give no conclusions or recommendations, just my observations. The chapters are free-standing. You can read them straight through or jump in anywhere. Everyone has life lessons and stories.

She has not been back in decades, reluctant to face the demons of her past. Now she visits with her children on their way to begin life anew in New York. Shortly after their arrival, though, her son, Daniel, recently diagnosed with early-onset bipolar disorder, vanishes from her side. The ensuing search through the haunts of her adolescence brings back painful memories of growing up with her psychic fortune-telling mother and the revelations that drove her to leave home at 15. But confronting the past may give Olivia what she needs to face the future. Cornwell&#x2019;s first novel is an authentic and artful coming-of-age story that is uniquely multigenerational. In lyrical language, she renders a turbulent adolescence that is achingly believable and a heartfelt tribute to the struggles of mental illness. Readers are kept on their toes as Olivia&#x2019;s story, by turns endearing and suspenseful, unfolds and the search for Daniel drags on. With great attention to detail and a smooth flow between past and present, this emotionally charged narrative is as memorable as it is compelling. --Cortney Ophoff",

Ignatius William Perrish wakes up bleary and confused after a night of drinking and \"doing terrible things\" to find he has grown horns. In addition to being horribly unsightly, these inflamed protuberances give Ig an equally ugly power--if he thinks hard enough, he can make people admit things (intimate, embarrassing, I-can't-believe-you-just-said-that details). This bizarre affliction is of particular use to Ig, who is still grieving over the murder of his childhood sweetheart (a grisly act the entire town, including his family, believes he committed).Hornsis a wickedly fun read, and reveals Hill's uncanny knack for creating alluring characters and a riveting plot. Ig's attempts to track down the killer result in hilariously inappropriate admissions from the community, heartbreaking confessions from his own family, and of course, one hell of a showdown.--Daphne Durham",
        "0062008048": "The gruesome murders of the beautiful and talented actress Sharon Tate, her unborn child and four others that same night at the hands of the notorious &#8220;Manson family&#8221; rocked the nation. As one of the most horrific crimes in modern history, these atrocities, the trial and the subsequent conviction of Charles Manson and his followers caused a media sensation, spawning movies, documentaries and bestselling books, including the classicHelter Skelter. A defining moment in an era otherwise associated with radical peace, love and understanding, this incident is one that still resonates with millions today.Yet while this crime left an indelible mark on society&#8217;s consciousness, it was, first and foremost, a shattering personal tragedy for those closest to Sharon&#8212;the loving family left to cope with the emotional devastation of her loss. Now, after nearly forty years, their story is finally revealed.Compiled by close family friend Alisa Statman and Sharon&#8217;s niece Brie Tate,Restless Soulsdraws on a wealth of material including interviews with the Tates, personal letters, tape recordings, home movies, public interviews, private journals, and official documents to provide a powerful, poignant, and affecting four-decade, three-generation memoir of crime and punishment, anguish and hope, rage and love, that is both a chronicle of death and a celebration of life.Extending beyond all previous accounts,Restless Soulsis the most revealing, riveting, and emotionally raw account not just of these heinous murders, the hunt and capture of the killers and the behind-the-scenes drama of their trials, but of the torment victims families&#8217; endure for years in the wake of such senseless violence.Tate family members set the record straight, correcting media misinformation and delving well beyond the official storyline to provide information, much of it available for the first time.

        "0060513608": "The events of September 11 have seemingly been covered, analyzed, and discussed from every angle imaginable. So the subject matter alone of Jim DeFede'sThe Day the World Came to Townmakes it noteworthy. In the immediate aftermath of the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, 38 commercial airliners carrying over 6,000 passengers were forced, as a precautionary measure, to land in Gander, Newfoundland, Canada. Due to the ongoing closure of U.S. airspace, the passengers spent four days in this isolated town of 10,000 before being allowed to continue on their way. In that time, Gander's residents rallied together to extend a kind of hospitality that seems too expansive for the wordhospitality. Townspeople not only opened schools and legion halls for use as emergency shelters, they invited the passengers into their homes for showers, meals, and warm beds while local businesses simply gave toiletries and clothing to passengers stuck without luggage. Despite the grim consequences that led to the situation, DeFede finds humor: two flight attendants are offered a car for sightseeing by a local woman who happened to be driving by; the stranded chairman of Hugo Boss finds himself shopping for men's underwear at the local Wal-Mart. But the real message of the book is how, even in times of great turmoil and conflict, people can and must look to one another for comfort, help, and hope.--John Moe",
        "006056668X": "In his entertaining adventure-in-whale-researching,Fluke, or, I Know Why the Winged Whale Sings, Nathan Quinn, a prominent marine biologist, has been conducting studies in Hawaii for years trying to unravel the secret of why humpback whales sing. During a typical day of data gathering, Nate believes his mind is failing: the subject whale has \"Bite Me\" scrawled across its tail. Events become even stranger as the self-proclaimed \"action nerds,\" Nate, photographer Clay, their research assistant Amy, and Kona, a white Rasta (a Jewish kid from New Jersey), encounter sabotage to their data and equipment. They also observe increasingly bizarre whale behavior, including a phone call from the whale to their wealthy sponsor to ask that Nate bring it a hot pastrami and Swiss on rye, and discover both a thriving underwater city and the secret to what happened to Amelia Earhart.Thoughtful, irreverent, and often hilarious, Moore has crafted a tale that contains a bit of the saga of declining whale populations due to hunting and habitat destruction, as well as his over-the-top, decadent wit as applied to scientific methodology and professional jealousies. Moore notes a pasty, rival scientist \"looked like Death out for his after-dinner stroll before a busy night of e-mailing heart attacks and tumors to a few million lucky winners,\" and that killer whales (which are all named Kevin), are \"just four tons of doofus dressed up like a police car.\" Smart, sincere, and a whale of a story,Flukeis terrific.--Michael Ferch--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

This slim volume finds protagonist Joanna and husband Walter and kids leaving the wicked city for the bucolic town of Stepford. Despite its ideal facade, the sleepy little storybook town actually is more wicked. Joanna soon notices that her female neighbors are all body and no brains and seemingly exist only to do housework while their husbands gather nightly at a mysterious men's club. Even worse, it appears that the women who moved there just before her suddenly begin morphing into hausfraus built like swimsuit models-and she's next! It's hard to tell if this is a stab at the feminist movement or simply a male fantasy, but it's a fun read and will keep you turning the pages. Note also that a new feature film based on this story is in the works.Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.",

        "0099460297": "The artful construction of this seductive novel and the mature, compassionate wisdom permeating it would be impressive for a seasoned writer, but it's all the more remarkable in a debut. This narrative of the McLeod family during three vital summers is rich with implications about the bonds and stresses of kin and friendship, the ache of loneliness and the cautious tendrils of renewal blossoming in unexpected ways. Glass depicts the mysterious twists of fate and cosmic (but unobtrusive) coincidences that bring people together, and the self-doubts and lack of communication that can keep them apart, in three fluidly connected sections in which characters interact over a decade. These people are entirely at home in their beautifully detailed settings Greece, rural Scotland, Greenwich Village and the Hamptons and are fully dimensional in their moments of both frailty and grace. Paul McLeod, the reticent Scots widower introduced in the first section, is the father of Fenno, the central character of the middle section, who is a reserved, self-protective gay bookstore owner in Manhattan; both have dealings with the third section's searching young artist, Fern Olitsky, whose guilt in the wake of her husband's death leaves her longing for and fearful of beginning anew. Other characters are memorably individualistic: an acerbic music critic dying of AIDS, Fenno's emotionally elusive mother, his sibling twins and their wives, and his insouciant lover among them. In this dazzling portrait of family life, Glass establishes her literary credentials with ingenuity and panache.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

        "0099416158": "Ever since he publishedThe Firmin 1991, John Grisham has remained the undisputed champ of the legal thriller. WithA Painted House, however, he strikes out in a new direction. As the author is quick to note, this novel includes \"not a single lawyer, dead or alive,\" and readers will search in vain for the kind of lowlife machinations that have been his stock-in-trade. Instead, Grisham has delivered a quieter, more contemplative story, set in rural Arkansas in 1952. It's harvest time on the Chandler farm, and the family has hired a crew of migrant Mexicans and \"hill people\" to pick 80 acres of cotton. A certain camaraderie pervades this bucolic dream team. But it's backbreaking work, particularly for the 7-year-old narrator, Luke: \"I would pick cotton, tearing the fluffy bolls from the stalks at a steady pace, stuffing them into the heavy sack, afraid to look down the row and be reminded of how endless it was, afraid to slow down because someone would notice.\"What's more, tensions begin to simmer between the Mexicans and the hill people, one of whom has a penchant for bare-knuckles brawling. This leads to a brutal murder, which young Luke has the bad luck to witness. At this point--with secrets, lies, and at least one knife fight in the offing--the plot begins to take on that familiar, Grisham-style momentum. Still, such matters ultimately take a back seat inA Painted Houseto the author's evocation of time and place. This is, after all, the scene of his boyhood, and Grisham waxes nostalgic without ever succumbing to deep-fried sentimentality. Meanwhile, his account of Luke's Baptist upbringing occasions some sly (and telling) humor:I'd been taught in Sunday school from the day I could walk that lying would send you straight to hell. No detours. No second chances. Straight into the fiery pit, where Satan was waiting with the likes of Hitler and Judas Iscariot and General Grant. Thou shalt not bear false witness, which, of course, didn't sound exactly like a strict prohibition against lying, but that was the way the Baptists interpreted it.Whether Grisham will continue along these lines, or revert to the judicial shark tank for his next book, is anybody's guess. ButA Painted Housesuggests that he's perfectly capable of telling an involving story with nary a subpoena in sight.--James Marcus--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

Rather than telling a new story, she tells an old one (scarcely lacking for historians) in a fresh way. Shlaes brings to the tale an emphasis on economic realities and consequences, especially when seen from the perspective of monetarist theory, and a focus on particular individuals and events, both celebrated and forgotten (at least relatively so). Thus the spotlight plays not only on Andrew Mellon, Wendell Wilkie and Rexford Tugwell but also on Father Divine and the Schechter brothers&mdash;kosher butcher wholesalers prosecuted by the federal National Recovery Administration for selling \"sick chickens.\" As befits a former writer for theWall Street Journal, Shlaes is sensitive to the dangers of government intervention in the economy&mdash;but also to the danger of the government's not intervening.

        "0060014342": "One-third of Western Europe's population died between 1348 and 1350, victims of the Black Death. Noted medievalist Norman Cantor tells the story of the pandemic and its widespread effects inIn the Wake of the Plague.After giving an overview, Cantor describes various theories about the medical crisis, from contemporary fears of a Jewish conspiracy to poison the water (and the resulting atrocities against European Jews) to a growing belief among modern historians that both bubonic plague and anthrax caused the spiraling death rates. Cantor also details ways in which the Black Death changed history, at both the personal level (family lines dying out) and the political (the Plantagenet kings may well have been able to hold onto France had their resources not been so diminished).Cantor veers from topic to topic, from dynastic worries to the Dance of Death, and from peasants' rights to Perpendicular Gothic. This makes for amusing reading, though those seeking an orderly narrative may be frustrated. He also seems overly concerned with rumors of homosexual behavior, and his attempt to link the savage method of Edward II's murder to a cooling in global weather is a bit farfetched.Cantor wears his considerable scholarship lightly, but includes a very useful critical biography for further reading.

        "B00002STEZ": "If Mario is Nintendo's Luke Skywalker, then it's safe to say that Donkey Kong is Nintendo's Darth Vader. Originally cast as the primate villain in the Donkey Kong arcade game back in the early '80s, Kong and his many descendants have stepped away from the \"dark side\" and become forces for good. While it's genetically unlikely that Kong is Mario's father, it's been well documented that Kong and company have been enlisted to rescue Nintendo in times of trouble. Remember when the Super NES was \"threatened\" by Sega's 32-bit/CD add-on hype? A game called Donkey Kong Country came out, featuring prerendered graphics never before seen on a home console. Not only did it breathe new life into the Super NES' sales, it spawned a profitable series that kept Nintendo's 16-bit scene alive for years to come. Fast forward to 1999. Sega and Sony again threaten the Nintendo 64 with superior game consoles, and once again Nintendo calls on Kong's descendants to breathe new life into its 64-bit system with Donkey Kong 64. While this much-anticipated 3D adventure game has high-quality gameplay and plenty of variety to fuel Nintendo's sales this holiday season, it lacks enough \"wow factor\" to exert the revolutionary influence that Donkey Kong Country had. Donkey Kong 64 starts with a well-worn storyline: Donkey Kong's isle of paradise faces destruction by an invading K.Rool and his crocodile Kremlings. Donkey now has four friends to help him defeat K.Rool: Diddy Kong, his perennial sidekick; Lanky Kong, an ape with super-stretchy limbs; Tiny Kong, a teenybopper who can shrink to fit into small holes; and Chunky Kong, a muscle-bound lunkhead who can lift boulders and smash down doors. Veterans of the Donkey Kong series will also note the return of old-timers like Cranky, Funky, and Candy, all of whom upgrade the Kongs with new abilities, hints, shooting weapons, and musical instruments that help unlock hidden areas. For the most part, Donkey Kong 64 is an explore-and-collect adventure. Those who obtain perverse pleasure from collecting every last coin and item in this type of game will be titillated - and those who don't will be frustrated. The main thrust is to find 200 golden bananas in the main world and in the seemingly standard individual stages: an underwater level, a forest level, a jungle level, an industrial level, etc. As expected, almost none of these bananas are in plain view - multipart puzzles and obstacles impede the way to these treasures. However, there's plenty more to collect: regular bananas, fairies (which you must take pictures of with a camera), banana medals, super-secret Rareware coins, blueprint pieces (found by defeating certain enemies), crowns (to unlock multiplayer games) and boss keys (to unlock new areas on the island). Now, factor in that each of the five characters must find some of these items individually: Devoted gamers will see this as added replay value, while others will see it as a royal pain in the Donkey derriere. If that weren't enough, it seems the developers threw every gameplay style they could think of into the mix. This gameplay variety is perhaps this title's main strength, although the quality of the games varies. For starters, the game has a separate two-to four-player mode, with games such as a battle arena, where Kongs can beat up each other in a circular ring, or a GoldenEye-type shooting game. In the adventure mode, you earn golden bananas by completing mini-bonus games. Some are true games in their own right, such as a racing track, race-boat water course, or mine-cart roller coaster - all of which look impressive in 3D. Some of these games are less visually impressive but are entertaining nevertheless, such as a maze where the Kong must avoid enemy detection, or a bug splattering stage. The remaining games - such as a simple target-shooting session or a slot machine - are either run-of-the-mill or too easy to sustain long-term interest. Finally, a couple of bonus games are direct translations of old-school titles, including a partial version of the original Donkey Kong arcade game that'll bring back memories for some. Since the Kongs learn unique abilities as the game progresses, some Kongs have special stages, as well. Remember the barrel-blast levels in the 16-bit games? Donkey now plays them in 3D with a target sight. As the barrel moves, you can shoot Donkey out to other barrels. Diddy gets a jet pack that lets him complete some flying stages, while the other three characters learn other impressive skills, such as shrinking (Tiny), climbing up steep slopes (Lanky), and lifting or breaking heavy objects (Chunky).

        "0007410956": "Amazon Best Books of the Month, May 2011:  Near the end of World War II, a plane carrying 24 members of the United States military, including nine Women&#x2019;s Army Corps (WAC) members, crashed into the New Guinea jungle during a sightseeing excursion. 21 men and women were killed. The three survivors--a beautiful WAC, a young lieutenant who lost his twin brother in the crash, and a severely injured sergeant--were stranded deep in a jungle valley notorious for its cannibalistic tribes. They had no food, little water, and no way to contact their military base. The story of their survival and the stunning efforts undertaken to save them are the crux ofLost in Shangri-La, Mitchell Zuckoff&#x2019;s remarkable and inspiring narrative. Faced with the potential brutality of the Dani tribe, known throughout the valley for its violence, the trio&#x2019;s lives were dependent on an unprecedented rescue mission--a dedicated group of paratroopers jumped into the jungle to provide aid and medical care, consequently leaving the survivors and paratroopers alike trapped on the jungle floor. A perilous rescue by plane became their only possible route to freedom. A riveting story of deliverance under the most unlikely circumstances,Lost in Shangri-Ladeserves its place among the great survival stories of World War II.--Lynette MongAmazon Exclusive: Hampton Sides ReviewsLost in Shangri-LaHampton Sidesis the editor-at-large forOutsidemagazine and the author of the international bestsellerGhost Soldiers, which won the 2002 PEN USA Award for nonfiction and the 2002 Discover Award from Barnes &amp; Noble, and also served as the basis for the 2005 Miramax filmThe Great Raid.Although World War II was the greatest conflict in the history of this planet, many a jaded reader has come to the reluctant conclusion that there aren&rsquo;t any more World War II stories left to tell. At least not good ones&mdash;not tales of the &ldquo;ripping good yarn&rdquo; variety. Yet remarkably, in his new bookLost in Shangri-La, Mitchell Zuckoff has found one, and he&rsquo;s told it with reportorial verve, narrative skill, and exquisite pacing.What makes this World War II story all the more fascinating is that it isn&rsquo;t really a war story&mdash;not in a strict military sense. It&rsquo;s more of an exotic adventure tale with rich anthropological shadings. In 1945, near the end of the war, an American plane crashes in a hidden jungle valley in New Guinea inhabited by Stone Age cannibals. 21 Americans die in the crash, but three injured survivors soon find themselves stumbling through the jungle without food, nursing terrible wounds and trying to elude Japanese snipers known to be holding out in the mountains.The first contact between the three Americans and the valley&rsquo;s Dani tribesmen is both poignant and comical. The Americans, Zuckoff writes, have &ldquo;crash-landed in a world that time didn&rsquo;t forget. Time never knew it existed.&rdquo; The tribesmen, who have never encountered metal and have yet to master the concept of the wheel, think the American interlopers are white spirits who&rsquo;ve descended on a vine from heaven, fulfilling an ancient legend. They&rsquo;re puzzled and fascinated by the layers of &ldquo;removable skin&rdquo; in which these alien visitors are wrapped; the natives, who smear their bodies in pig grease and cover their genitals with gourds, have never seen clothes before.The Americans, in turn, are pretty sure their boartusk-bestudded hosts want to skewer them for dinner.What ensues in Zuckoff&rsquo;s fine telling is not so much a cultural collision as a pleasing and sometimes hilarious mutual unraveling of assumptions. Though the differences in the two societies are chasmic, the Americans and the Dani become&mdash;in a guarded, tentative sort of way&mdash;friends.But when armed American airmen arrive via parachute to rescue the survivors, relations become more tense. The Americans make their camp right in the middle of a no-man&rsquo;s land between warring Dani tribes&mdash;a no-man&rsquo;s land where for centuries they have fought the battles that are central to their daily culture. Here, Zuckoff notes, the ironies are profoundly rich. The Dani, untouched by and indeed utterly unaware of the great war that&rsquo;s been raging all across the globe, become thoroughly discombobulated when their own war is temporarily disrupted.Yes, therearestill a few good World War II stories left to tell. And yes, this one meets all the requirements of a ripping good yarn. Zuckoff, who teaches journalism at Boston University, is a first-rate reporter who has spared no expense to rescue this tale from obscurity. His story has it all: Tragedy, survival, comedy, an incredibly dangerous eleventh-hour rescue, and an immensely attractive heroine to boot. It&rsquo;s extraordinary that Hollywood hasn&rsquo;t already taken this tale and run wild with it. If it did, the resulting movie would be equal partsAlive,Cast Away, andThe Gods Must Be Crazy. It&rsquo;s as though the Americans have arrived in the Stone Age through a wormhole in the space-time continuum. The Dani don&rsquo;t know what to do with themselves&mdash;and life, as any of us know it, will never be the same.--This text refers to theHardcoveredition.",
        "0061939897": "No good deed goes unpunished. Just ask Steve Schmidt, John McCain&#x2019;s campaign manager and the guy who pushed Sarah Palin as McCain&#x2019;s running mate. Now, in Palin&#x2019;s much-hyped book, he&#x2019;s just a fat, smoking bullet-head who told her to &#x201C;stick to the script.&#x201D; The feeling running through Going Rogue is that Palin has been bursting to take a whack at those she believes didn&#x2019;t do right by her during the campaign. (Katie Couric, we&#x2019;re looking at you!) Before readers get to that, however, there&#x2019;s personal biography. We&#x2019;re introduced to Sarah the reader&#x2014;loved to read&#x2014;the basketball player, hunter, wife, mother. Then lots and lots of Alaska politics, which will probably be a little hard even for people from Alaska to plow through. (Scores are settled here, too.) Once Palin gets into the 2008 campaign, the tone is folksy, but the knives are out. Much has been made of her criticisms of Schmidt and another McCain staffer, Nicolle Wallace. But less has been said about Palin&#x2019;s comments about Barack Obama. For instance, she notes that when she and husband Todd first heard Obama speak, they saw the wow factor but worried that his &#x201C;smooth&#x201D; talk would hide his radical ideas. She also implies that Obama wanted to shield only his own children from the press, though, in fact, in September 2008, he told CNN that Palin&#x2019;s children must be off limits as well. Ronald Reagan&#x2019;s name is mentioned by page 3 and invoked regularly throughout. There&#x2019;s no doubt Palin sees herself as heir to his legacy. But many readers will see the Sarah Palin revealed in these pages as much closer to George Bush, someone you&#x2019;d like to have a beer with. Or perhaps dinner: &#x201C;I always remind people from outside our state that there&#x2019;s plenty of room for all Alaska&#x2019;s animals&#x2014;right next to the mashed potatoes.&#x201D; --Ilene Cooper",
        "0061236829": "Starred Review. At the beginning of Oates's 36th novel, Rebecca Schwart is mistaken by a seemingly harmless man for another woman, Hazel Jones, on a footpath in 1959 Chatauqua Falls, N.Y. Five hundred pages later, Rebecca will find out that the man who accosted her is a serial killer, and Oates will have exercised, in a manner very difficult to forget, two of her recurring themes: the provisionality of identity and the awful suddenness of male violence. There's plenty of backstory, told in retrospect. Rebecca's parents escape from the Nazis with their two sons in 1936; Rebecca is born in the boat crossing over. When Rebecca is 13, her father, Jacob, a sexton in Milburn, N.Y., kills her mother, Anna, and nearly kills Rebecca, before blowing his own head off. At the time of the footpath crossing, Rebecca is just weeks away from being beaten, almost to death, by her husband, Niles Tignor (a shady traveling beer salesman). She and son Niley flee; she takes the name of the woman for whom she has been recently mistaken and becomes Hazel Jones. Niley, a nine-year-old with a musical gift, becomes Zacharias, \"a name from the bible,\" Rebecca tells people. Rebecca's Hazel navigates American norms as a waitress, salesperson and finally common-law wife of the heir of the Gallagher media fortune, a man in whom she never confides her past. Oates is our finest novelistic tracker, following the traces of some character's flight from or toward some ultimate violence with forensic precision. There are allusions here to the mythic scouts of James Fenimore Cooper'sLeatherstocking Tales, who explored the same New York territory when it was primeval woods. Many of the passages are a lot like a blown-up photo of a bruise&mdash;ugly without seeming to have a point. Yet the traumatic pattern of the hunter and the hunted, unfolded in Rebecca/Hazel's lifelong escape, never cripples Hazel: she is liberated, made crafty, deepened by her ultimately successful flight. Like Theodore Dreiser, Oates wears out objections with her characters, drawn in an explosive vernacular. Everything in this book depends on Oates' ability to bring a woman before the reader who is deeply veiled&mdash;whose real name is unknown even to herself&mdash;and she does it with epic panache.(June)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0061791059": "Starred Review. Grade 5&ndash;8&mdash;Jane Eyre meets Lemony Snicket in this smart, surprising satire of a 19th-century English governess story. A witty omniscient narrator speaks directly to modern readers and follows 15-year-old Penelope, recent graduate of the Swanburne Academy for Poor Bright Females, to British country manor Ashton Place, where conniving Lord Fredrick has discovered three wild children apparently raised by wolves while hunting in his vast forest property. To Lord Fredrick, who's named them Alexander, Beowulf, and Cassiopeia Incorrigible, the children are trophies and property (\"Finder's keepers, what?\"); to young Lady Constance they're savage nuisances who howl, chase squirrels, and gnaw on shoes. Enter Penelope Lumley, charged with taming them in time for a Christmas party, and bolstered by her top-notch classical education and an endless supply of platitudes from Agatha Swanburne. She also comes armed with a cherished book of poetry and her favorite fiction series, \"Giddy-Yap, Rainbow!\" There are stock characters, and there are mysteries. Most of all, without taking itself too seriously, there is commentary on writing itself, the dangers and the benefits of relying on books for moral courage, and the perils of drawing false expectations of the world from literature. Penelope shows growth, confronting issues of social class and expectation versus reality, and eventually realizing her own capacity for insight. Humorous antics and a climactic cliff-hanger ending will keep children turning pages and clamoring for the next volume, while more sophisticated readers will take away much more. Frequent plate-sized illustrations add wit and period flair.&mdash;Riva Pollard, Prospect Sierra Middle School, El Cerrito, CA(c) Copyright 2010.

        "0062110837": "An Amazon Best Book of the Month, April 2013: Imaginative and meticulously researched, this enchanting debut novel from Helene Wecker is, in reality, an historical fiction. Set primarily in turn-of-the-century Manhattan, it deliberately details the immigrant experience--the wonders and hardships of being in a new country and the discoveries, triumphs, and failures that follow--while bringing the city itself to life with such passion that New York of yore seems like a magical land. Beyond reality, however,The Golem and the Jinni, as the title implies, is also a fantastic work of fantasy. The Golem is an insatiably curious clay \"woman\" that was created to seem human while serving only her husband; the Jinni is a magical \"man\" whose fascination with mortals has left him nearly stripped of his own nature and forced to live as one. These mythical characters from otherwise clashing cultures not only coexist, but come to rely upon one another in order to exist at all. In turn, their story finds us not only rooting for them to find peace and happiness, but gaining a better understanding of our own human nature in the process.--Robin A. Rothman",

        "006230755X": "Blum specializes in nonfiction narrative showcasing explosive periods in U.S. history, as in the Edgar Award&#x2013;winning American Lightning (2011). His latest focuses on the period before WWI, when German saboteurs in the U.S. attempted to use bombs and even biological weapons, hoping to weaken the country enough to keep it from entering the war on the side of the Allies. The hero of the piece is New York Police Inspector Tom Tunney, who thwarted many of the plots and captured numerous enemy agents in New York. One problem common to books of this kind is that the author tries to make everything relate to the plot, sometimes pulling the rug out from under the reader in the process. For example, the opening describes a bomb plot aimed at St. Patrick&#x2019;s Cathedral in New York City, prompting the reader to think, &#x201C;Wow! I didn&#x2019;t know the Germans did that.&#x201D; We learn later that Blum is only setting the scene of an unstable era, and that the plot was actually the work of anarchists, not Germans.

But, instead of selecting a difficulty level at the start of the game, GOW offers a choice at the beginning of each level. In the vein ofchoose your own adventure, you can select between a difficult or easy path. And it's not just a simple choice of battling tougher enemies; each path (explained by a comrade) represents additional content that is crucial to the storyline. After easing your way into the experience of the gameplay with the simpler paths, you can go back and test your skills on the more difficult routes and never feel like you've played through the areas before.Standing around in the open is likely to get you killed inGOW. You must use cover to survive. With a context sensitive A button function, you won't have to sweat memorizing cumbersome button combos. The A button will:Slam you into cover. As you approach cover inGOWsimply tap the A button to slide and make immediate use of cover.Vault you over the cover. Once you're in cover, pressing up and A will vault you over your cover to engage the opponent or next cover opportunity.Evade enemy fire. When you're forced to be out in the open, tapping the A button will engage a roll maneuver to evade enemy fire.Activate a \"Swat Turn.\" When taking cover on the side of a doorway, pressing the A button will spin your character from one side of the doorway to the other, helping avoid fire.Ripping a magazine free and replacing it in the midst of bloody combat is no easy task.GOWsimulates this difficult action by forcing you to perfect your reloading skills. To be effective in combat you'll need to allot for time to successfully reload your weapon. Do it well and the battle is yours; do it poorly and you may actually jam your gun. Time it perfectly and you'll earn a bonus with a temporary damage boost. ThoughGOWclearly showcases a sci-fi experience, its roots are in tactical, realistic combat scenarios. Therefore, running and gunning makes for seriously erratic shooting. Think about what you're doing. Unless wasting ammo is your goal, you better stop, aim, shoot, and then move on. Otherwise, the Locust Horde might swarm you and take your life.Gears of Warpresents a focused and well-paced cinematic experience, and nothing ruins that faster than a time-consuming exploration of every switch or button to find the elusive trigger to open a door. This game introduces a \"point of interest\" button that comes up on the screen so you can immediately interact with the necessary item to move forward in your gameplay.GOWcertainly offers drool-worthy graphics, but the mechanics have also received equal attention. Keep your eyes and ears on high alert for a release date, as Microsoft hasn't let the cat out of the bag on when gamers will be able to tackle this great-looking and great-playing title.",

        "0062114875": "Gr 8 Up-Everyone is born with a twin: two souls-one body. Only, in America, it's illegal to remain that way-to be a hybrid. The dominant soul is supposed to take over, and the recessive, or weaker one is supposed to disappear, usually by the time the child is six. But even though Addie was the stronger soul, Eva held on. Despite the fact that she could no longer move or speak to anyone but Addie, she didn't go away. Now that they are teens, Addie and Eva have adopted rules of behavior in order to survive: don't stand out, don't be exceptional, blend in at all costs. But then the girls become friends with Hally and her brother, Devon, and the siblings show the sisters that there's another way to live-Eva can reemerge. But Eva's freedom comes at high price: imprisonment in a hospital that wants to \"cure\" kids of being hybrids and where patients who \"go home\" are never heard from again. This uniquely imagined novel doesn't fall short in the execution. Zhang's prose is lovely, and the plot is compelling to the last page. If there's one complaint to be made it's that the differences in characterization of the hybrid siblings are very subtle, and it's occasionally difficult to immediately see the change when different personalities take over. It will be easy to categorize this book as yet another dystopian novel, but it is remarkable and will stand out from the rest.-Heather M. Campbell, formerly at Philip S.

Jinx is that staple of children's literature: the scorned, ill-used orphan who proves to be so much more gifted and important than he ever imagined possible. He occupies a world that is simultaneously original and familiar, influenced by centuries of folklore, but newly envisioned and vividly created. This eldritch, primeval forest that Jinx has been warned to shun is, nevertheless, where he has been abandoned by his heartless stepfather. Blackwood has populated this magical place with convincingly conflicted wizards and witches who seem uncertain as to how much they should be using their skills to control events or the beings around them. Jinx is slow to recognize his own powers as he digs his bare toes into the earth of the forest and feels the pulsing heartbeat of its life, or finds that he can call up fire. He is even slower to divine the motives of the various people he encounters, including Elwyn and Reven-youths under mysterious curses of their own-who navigate the Urwald beside him. Readers will thrill to the journey with Jinx as he discovers and grows into himself. Though they will not feel abandoned at the edge of a cliff at the book's end, they won't be surprised-and will be delighted-if sequels are in the offing.-Miriam Lang Budin, Chappaqua Library, NY&#x3B1;(c) Copyright 2011.

The author is off to a good start with the tale of how Vivi, Teensy, Caro and Necie met as little girls in 1930, their spunk and liveliness a harbinger of things to come. But the focus on the Ya-Yas' early years soon wavers and the novel is all over the map&mdash;here a few tales about the grown-up Ya-Yas, like Vivi's run-in with her son's first-grade teacher, a pompous nun; there a story about Vivi's eldest daughter, Sidda, one of the so-called \"Petites Ya-Yas,\" and her directorial debut at age eight at a Valentine's Day party. A chapter appears out of nowhere from the viewpoint of Myrtis Spevey, a contemporary of the original Ya-Yas, who is so excessively jealous and resentful of the friends that she comes off as a cartoon character. After a vexing 30-year leap, Myrtis's creepy, emotionally ill daughter, Edythe, takes over the narrative, kidnapping one of the Ya-Yas' grandchildren. What begins as a collection of haphazard but entertaining snippets from the Ya-Yas' lives suddenly bumps up against a sober story about a missing child and the lengths to which parents will go to protect their young. Readers may lose patience as even the loose family-album format fails to hold up, but Wells still charms when she focuses on the redemptive power of family love and the special bond that comes from genuine, long-lived friendship.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "006166118X": "Book DescriptionDead cats. That's the image many people conjure up when you mention curiosity. An image perpetuated by a dusty old proverb that has long represented the extent of our understanding of the term. This book might not put the proverb to rest, but it will flip it upside down: far from killing anything, curiosity breathes new life into almost everything it touches.In Curious?Dr. Todd Kashdan offers a profound new message missing from so many books on happiness: the greatest opportunities for joy, purpose, and personal growth don't, in fact, happen when we're searching for happiness. They happen when we are mindful, when we explore what's novel, and when we live in the moment and embrace uncertainty. Positive events last longer and we can extract more pleasure and meaning from them when we are open to new experiences and relish the unknown.Dr. Kashdan uses science, story, and practical exercises to show you how to become what he calls a curious explorer&#8212;a person who's comfortable with risk and challenge and who functions optimally in an unstable, unpredictable world. Here's a blueprint for building lasting, meaningful relationships, improving health, increasing creativity, and boosting productivity. Aren't you curious to know more?HowCurious?Will Help You: An Essay by Todd KashdanWithout question, happiness is important. Who doesn't want to be happy and wish the same for their loved ones? But this book is not limited to happiness. This is a book about living a life that matters with a broader view about what the \"good life\" entails. Much of what we desire often has nothing to do with happiness but is just as important. This includes meaning and purpose in life, wisdom, satisfying relationships, the ability to tolerate distress, spirituality, creativity, compassion, feeling a sense of competence and mastery, and so on. Sometimes trying to be happy actually gets in the way of making inroads toward these other elements. Effectively handling the pain and stress that life brings is an essential part of creating a rich, meaningful existence.When you adopt this broad view of what matters, an important question remains that this entire book hinges on. What is essential to creating a fulfilling life? The answer is&#x2026;Being curious.Being open to new experiences.Being able to effectively manage ambiguity and uncertainty.Being able to adapt to the demands required of different situations (what I call &#x201C;psychological flexibility&#x201D;).Discovering our strengths, deepest values, and what it is we are passionate about.Strengthening connections to these values and passionate pursuits so that we can pursue a life aligned with them.This book provides a closer look at curiosity; a neglected and underappreciated strength in our arsenal. People regularly ignore curiosity because it appears, on the surface, to be a very obvious, simple, impotent emotion--something unusual appears or someone captivates us by a story, we feel curious, and direct our attention to explore further. But while this emotion seemed simplistic even to me, as I began my research, I soon discovered that curiosity is a deeper, more complex phenomenon that plays a critical role in what makes people&#x2019;s lives most worth living. Curiosity is the spark plug that ignites other factors that contribute to happiness and meaning in life. You can't work with strengths until you spot them and investigate them.  You can't be grateful without being curious about what benefits you received in your life.Besides a better understanding of curiosity, readers will be introduced to strategies for becoming a more curious explorer. By reclaiming curiosity and learning how to wield it, readers will be able to demonstrably alter the quality of their lives. A good portion of this book focuses on how to find, create, and sustain fulfilling moments and a fulfilling life.HowCurious?Will Help You[PDF]",
        "0006514006": "Sisterly rivalry is the basis of this fresh, wonderfully vivid retelling of the story of Anne Boleyn. Anne, her sister Mary and their brother George are all brought to the king's court at a young age, as players in their uncle's plans to advance the family's fortunes. Mary, the sweet, blond sister, wins King Henry VIII's favor when she is barely 14 and already married to one of his courtiers. Their affair lasts several years, and she gives Henry a daughter and a son. But her dark, clever, scheming sister, Anne, insinuates herself into Henry's graces, styling herself as his adviser and confidant. Soon she displaces Mary as his lover and begins her machinations to rid him of his wife, Katherine of Aragon. This is only the beginning of the intrigue that Gregory so handily chronicles, capturing beautifully the mingled hate and nearly incestuous love Anne, Mary and George (\"kin and enemies all at once\") feel for each other and the toll their family's ambition takes on them. Mary, the story's narrator, is the most sympathetic of the siblings, but even she is twisted by the demands of power and status; charming George, an able plotter, finally brings disaster on his own head by falling in love with a male courtier. Anne, most tormented of all, is ruthless in her drive to become queen, and then to give Henry a male heir. Rather than settling for a picturesque rendering of court life, Gregory conveys its claustrophobic, all-consuming nature with consummate skill. In the end, Anne's famous, tragic end is offset by Mary's happier fate, but the self-defeating folly of the quest for power lingers longest in the reader's mind.Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an alternatePaperbackedition.",

        "B00009WNZA": "The Simswas one of the most popular games ever made. In it, players micromanage the lives of a family of virtual people, or Sims, and influence their paths toward success or something akin to a nervous breakdown. Its open-ended blend of cartoonish behavior and everyday living is unique in an art form otherwise obsessed with carnage and sports. WithThe Sims 2, long-time fans now have a deeper game with lots of ways to customize and share their experiences. The game will also attract first-timers because the goal-oriented gameplay and the luridly fun starter families make it easier to get into the action right out of the box.Now Sims are born with the traits of their parents, families grow, and Sims grow old.The People in Your NeighborhoodThe game starts at the neighborhood level. Here you can create a housing development from scratch or start with one of three premade neighborhoods, each with its own theme. From there, you'll settle on a house and a family of Sims to control.Create your own Sim (above) or your own house (below) from scratch with advanced tools.Aside from the basic needs carried over from the previous game, Sims now have aspirations, wants, and fears. The wants and fears are the day-to-day things that occupy their minds, like wanting to see friends or get married and fearing death or being rejected for a kiss. Satisfy their wants, and they become more efficient at completing tasks you assign them. Realize their fears, and Sims become lethargic, cranky, and unresponsive to your commands. Aspirations are the big-picture things, like raising a family, becoming wealthy, and gaining knowledge. Succeed here and you'll be able to buy odd gifts for your Sim to improve his or her life, like a money tree that pays dividends or a \"fountain of youth\" water cooler.What Else Is New?Of course, you wouldn't be able to juggle all that if it weren't for the improved \"Free Will\" option, which makes it easier for Sims to fulfill their basic needs. The artificial intelligence of the game is noticeably improved; they won't turn on radios just as a family member is going to bed but, strangely, they do occasionally put their dishes on the floor.Another big change in the series is the concept of the lifespan. Now Sims are born with the traits of their parents, families grow, and Sims grow old. Not only does this go hand in hand with aspirations (growing up is the first aspiration that a baby Sim will have), it provides a limited time with which your Sims can achieve their goals.The Universal Control Panel helps you manage your Sim family.A Family AffairThe Sims 2not only lets you create just about any type of Sim in any type of family, build elaborate houses, and even create a neighborhood from scratch, but it also allows you to start the gamein medias res, with premade households. These families all have backstories that are smart spoofs of soap-opera plots--lots of scheming, romance, ghosts, and family fighting. Parents of teens shouldn't worry, though, because nudity is tastefully blurred out and \"woo-hoo\" between Sims takes place completely under the covers. The ESRB has given this a Teen rating. IfThe Sims 2were a film, it would likely land between PG and PG-13.The makers have included some nice tools to help share the universe you've created. For example, you can capture in-game stills and video to show friends the private moments, family interactions, and house parties of your Sims. You can even package a household to share as a blog or an album on a special Web site.The Sims 2is for patient gamers. Like life itself, the game is filled with mundane details, like getting ready for work and doing dishes. The game also demands a level of creativity from its players that the run-and-gun game genres wouldn't know what to do with. But those who stick with it will be rewarded with an absorbing, amusing diversion and a virtual family history that they've created themselves.--Porter B.

        "0099297701": "Horror lit's head chef Harris serves up another course in his Hannibal \"The Cannibal\" Lecter trilogy, and it's a pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance for those with strong stomachs. In the first book,Red Dragon(filmed asManhunter), Hannibal diabolically helps the FBI track a fascinating serial killer. (Takes one to know one.) InThe Silence of the Lambs, he advises fledgling FBI manhunter Clarice Starling, then makes a bloody, brilliant escape.Years later, posing as scholarly Dr. Fell, curator of a grand family's palazzo, Hannibal lives the good life in Florence, playing lovely tunes by serial killer/composer Henry VIII and killing hardly anyone himself. Clarice is unluckier: in the novel's action-film-like opening scene, she survives an FBI shootout gone wrong, and her nemesis, Paul Krendler, makes her the fall guy. Clarice is suspended, so, unfortunately, the first cop who stumbles on Hannibal is an Italian named Pazzi, who takes after his ancestors, greedy betrayers depicted in Dante'sInferno.Pazzi is on the take from a character as scary as Hannibal: Mason Verger. When Verger was a young man busted for raping children, his vast wealth saved him from jail. All he needed was psychotherapy--with Dr. Lecter. Thanks to the treatment, Verger is now on a respirator, paralyzed except for one crablike hand, watching his enormous, brutal moray eel swim figure eights and devour fish. His obsession is to feed Lecter to some other brutal pets.What happens when the Italian cop gets alone with Hannibal? How does Clarice's reunion with Lecter go from macabre to worse? Suffice it to say that the plot is Harris's weirdest, but it still has his signature mastery of realistic detail. There are flaws: Hannibal's madness gets a motive, which is creepy but lessens his mystery. If you want an exact duplicate ofThe Silence of the Lambs's Clarice/Hannibal duel, you'll miss what's cool about this book--that Hannibal is actually upstaged at points by other monsters. And if you think it's all unprecedentedly horrible, you're right. But note that the horrors are described with exquisite taste. Harris's secret recipe for success is restraint.--Tim Appelo--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

        "0061929387": "*Starred Review* Crichton, who died in 2008, was known primarily for such high-tech thrillers as Jurassic Park and The Andromeda Strain. This new novel, found in manuscript form among his papers, will come as a bit of a surprise to many of his fans. It is, of all things, a pirate novel. Set in 1665, it tells the story of Captain Charles Hunter, a privateer who&#x2019;s hired by the governor of Jamaica&#x2019;s Port Royal to steal a Spanish galleon and its cargo of gold treasure. Don&#x2019;t expect to see Jack Sparrow in this story of pirates of the Caribbean, though: Crichton doesn&#x2019;t play his pirates for laughs. And this is no typical pirate adventure, either: it&#x2019;s actually a caper novel posing as a high-seas adventure. All the key caper-novel elements are here: the target, the mastermind, the plan, the motley crew, the ruthless villain, the gadgets, the twist, and the turncoat. Crichton keeps us in a constant state of suspense, never revealing quite what his hero, Captain Hunter, has up his sleeve, and the novel ends most unexpectedly. Pirate fans will love the book for its flashy characters and historical authenticity. Crime fans will enjoy the caper-novel structure and the way the author keeps them on their toes. If this really is Crichton&#x2019;s final book, it&#x2019;s a splendid send-off: something new, different, and daring. --David Pitt--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

Under hypnosis, she relives the final, tortured moments in the life of Matilda, a 12th century Welshwoman. In the process, Jo herself comes close to death. The story then jumps 15 years. Jo, now a journalist researching regression, is again hypnotized and again regresses to Matilda's excitement-packed life. Unfortunately, the pace of the early pages is not maintained. The problem is not with Jo/Matilda, who are both well-drawn, or even with the whopping coincidences Jo encounters. What slows the narrative is the bevy of minor characters, Jo's acquaintances. They talk to her and about her, they try to help her and they conspire against her, all at the expense of the central plotline. This is still a good read, but it could have been better.

Nintendo fused the global familiarity of a remote control with the sophistication of motion-sensing technology to come up with an input device that differentiates the Wii from any other console that has come before it.Revolutionary controlSporting the dimensions of a small traditional remote control, the wireless Wii Remote is a multifunctional device that is limited only by the game designer's imagination. The magic of the Wii Remote's design lies within; acellerometers inside the controller body measure movement in all directions and at all speeds. In a tennis game, it serves as your racket as you swing your arm for a long forehand or a quick and hard backhand. In a 4x4 driving game it serves as a steering wheel, allowing you to swerve to avoid obstacles or pickup power-ups. In first-person shooters, the Wii Remote acts as a firearm that you can point directly at an on-screen enemy. The list of potential uses is enormous, and the light weight of the Wii Remote allows gamers to play for hours without feeling fatigued.The Wii Remote boasts impressive technology for such a compact package.All Wii Remote buttons are accessible and responsive.View larger.Control many games from up to 30 feet away.View larger.The motion sensing technology is neatly tucked away within the Wii Remote body.View larger.The remote feels comfortable in both right and left hands.View larger.As comfortable as it is functionalThe Wii Remote is equally comfortable in right and left hands and houses just the right number of buttons for gaming- not so many that new players will get confused, but enough so that Wii games don't feel constrained. On the face of the remote are the D (or \"plus\") pad, a large \"A\" button which is used for major on-screen actions, and two small options buttons. Between the game buttons are a plus and minus buttons (which often act as \"forwards\" and \"back\"), as well as a \"Home\" button to engage the Wii home screen to change settings or check remote battery levels. On the back side of the controller is a trigger-like \"B\" button, perfect for timing releases of a bowling roll inWii Sports.Thankfully, battery life is excellent with the two included AA batteries, just as with the previous generation of Nintendo wireless controllers.Immersive intelligenceAlong the bottom of the Wii Remote, four blue LED lights indicate which player position the remote is currently set to. The controller automatically connects to the Wii console via Bluetooth wireless technology. Below the LEDs, an expansion port lets you connect a number of devices including the Nunchuck and Classic controllers for Virtual Console gaming (Virtual Console games and controller accessories sold separately). Other features of the Wii Remote include adjustable rumble force-feedback and a reinforced wrist strap to ensure safe use. A speaker inside the remote gives the player feedback about the strength of swings or the accuracy of their moves- such as realistic tennis noises as the \"racket\" connects with the ball inWii Sports. Overall, the physical design of the remote is extremely sturdy and of very high quality, ensuring countless hours of Wii gaming fun!",

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers.

        "0060838574": "As true crime books go, this addition to the Scott and Laci Peterson library isn't particularly riveting, salacious or revealing, which is strange considering Bird's unique perspective. Adopted as a child, Bird reunited with her birth mother, Jackie Peterson, Scott's mother, in late 1997. Bird takes every opportunity to stress that she grew very close to the Peterson family, but there's very little evidence of this apart from Bird's own assertions. The reader learns tidbits about Scott and Laci: i.e., Laci loved flowers, and Scott \"was a real charmer, the kind of guy who lights up a room.\" But such details hover on the surface. In fact, this book reveals more about the author's self-delusional behavior than the crime itself. Laci's abduction occurs early on, and for the rest of the book, Bird relates how, despite all evidence to the contrary, she refused to believe her brother could be guilty. Her denial is such that, after Scott's arrest, Bird writes letters to him in which she replaces the word \"jail\" with \"camp.\" Despite Bird's frequent protestations, one wonders if she isn't disingenuous at times. She professes her love for her birth mother, for example, yet paints her in an unflattering light (\"I was beginning to understand why Jackie was so critical of Laci. No one was good enough for her golden boy\"). With the help of a therapist, Bird finally accepts the evidence and devises her list of 33 reasons why her brother is guilty. This list-which takes up a mere five pages and offers such banal reasons as Scott \"flirted with our babysitter\"-is just as superficial as the rest of the book.

Being an investigator of keen insight, it occurred to me that Tony was somebody we needed to find.It being Detroit, the woman had used an alias to report the crime and &ldquo;Tony&rdquo; would turn out to be a nickname without a single etymological connection to the killer&rsquo;s true identity.  These&mdash;let&rsquo;s call them&mdash;big city idiosyncrasies, caused a two-month delay before we were able to arrest Benjamin Atkins and obtain a confession to 11th homicides, along with a planned 12th to celebrate his birthday in two weeks.--Noah Boyd",

But in Lehane&rsquo;s hands, the Prohibition-era tale of Joe Coughlin&rsquo;s rise to criminal power is both fresh and nuanced, packed with guns, booze, and babes as it roars from Boston to Tampa to Cuba. As Coughlin crosses deeper into the dark side--among those who &ldquo;live by night and dance fast&rdquo;--he provokes the question that sustains this propulsive narrative: Can a man be a good mobster and a good person at the same time? Incredibly, Lehane, who becomes more masterful with each book, has us rooting for Coughlin even as he slowly becomes the kind of monster mobster he once reviled and rebelled against. --Neal Thompson",

And with the addition of activities like Skateboarding and Rhythm Kung Fu, players will be using the Wii Balance Board accessory in a variety of new and fun ways.GameplayAs with the originalWii Fitrelease,Wii Fit Plusis designed, as its name implies, to improve the user's fitness. The game contains a large number of activities that fall into a variety of categories, including: yoga, aerobics, strength training and balance games. With all but a few exceptions, which utilize variations on a standard Wii Remote configuration, all activities utilize the Wii Balance Board (included with this bundle), either alone or configured with either a Wii Remote alone or the Wii Remote and nunchuck. The Balance Board, like any other Wii controller acts as a motion/pressure sensing device wirelessly synched to your Wii and replicating your body's movements. Each controller employed occupies one of the Wii's four wireless inputs, together mapping the reference points needed to recreate most full body motions on screen. Although this limits the majority of the activities to a single player orientation, various activities throughout the game support up to eight players in alternating play.To useWii Fit Plusplayers import their Miis from their Wii system, set up profiles, establish a current physical baseline, set fitness goals, and embark on a routine to reach them.Wii Fit Plustracks your usage, weight and progress towards your goal over time, giving you a status report as you start each session. At any time players can choose whatever activity they want, whether exercise or balance game, and as they progress in these they will level up in each, gaining points, setting high scores and unlocking more activities.Personalization Option Via 'The Locker Room'The originalWii Fitwas designed to have something for everyone. NowWii Fit Plusraises the bar by providing users with personalization options that allow them to find/create a specific workout routine that is exactly right for them, their family and their lifestyle. One example of this is \"The Locker Room.\" Easily accessible throughout the game, here players can choose from a number customizable options that allow them to maximize their time withWii Fit Pluswithout having to navigate through the game menu while in the middle of a workout. In essence this allows players to become their own personal trainer. Customization options available within The Locker Room include: preprogrammed and timedWii Fit PlusRoutines; My Routine, where you choose your own set of activities, optimizing their length and area of the body to be focused on; and Favorites, a notation of activities you frequent, which provides fast access to exercises you enjoy doing the most.Addition Yoga and Strength ExercisesDesigned as an addition to the already substantial list of focused, physical exercises available inWii Fit,Wii Fit Pluscontains six new and challenging strength and yoga activities. But continuing with the game's commitment to personalization, the key to these additions is not in their volume, but in how the player chooses to mix and match them. Do them in the order they are presented, or combine them in whatever order you want. The choice is yours. The player even has the ability to repeat the ones that he/she prefers, maximizing attention and effort where it is needed most. In addition, for those to whom time is a commodity, you can now omit unnecessary interludes between exercises, making for a continuous, timesaving routine.A Wealth of New Balance GamesRegardless of the considerable fitness factor packed intoWii Fit Plus, the Nintendo brand is and will always be all about having fun. With that in mindWii Fit Plusalso comes packed with 15 new, entertaining balance games suitable for every member of the family. Just a few of those that players can expect to see are: Juggling; Skateboarding; Snowball Fight; Obstacle Course, a log-leaping, cannonball-evading event reminiscent of what Nintendo icon Mario must go through; and Perfect 10, a balance game designed to promote a combination of physical and mental health. In this final example the player's Mii is situated between multiple color-coated balls, each showing specific numbers, with the goal to swing your hips, hula style, in different directions to tap out a total of ten as many times as possible before time runs out.Key Game FeaturesTheWii Fit PlusBundle includes the game software and the Wii Balance Board.Users can input the amount of time they want to spend on their workouts or select an area for personal improvement, andWii Fit Pluswill suggest a number of diverse activities for them.For the first time, users can mix and match which strength and yoga activities they prefer on a given day.

        "0061161705": "Football, food, fashion and wizards collide in Pratchett's 37th Discworld novel (after 2007'sMaking Money), an affectionate satire on the foibles of sports and sports fans. The always out-of-touch wizards at Ankh-Morpork's Unseen University stand to lose a very big bequest unless they enter a team in a violent but popular street sport competition. As the wizards struggle to learn the game, aided by the university's hired help, Ankh-Morpork's ruler schemes to use the competition for his own purposes. Though the book suffers from a few awkward moments (Pratchett's attempts to discuss racism through the strained relationships of dwarves, humans and goblins fall particularly flat), the prose crackles with wit and charm, and the sendups of league football, academic posturing,Romeo and Julietand cheesy sports dramas are razor sharp and hilarious but never cruel. At its heart, this is an intelligent, cheeky love letter to football, its fans and the unifying power of sports.(Oct.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Called in to investigate the apparent suicide of a male Grant Tech student, Sara brings along her pregnant sister, Tessa, who wanders away from the scene and is brutally attacked. The distraught Sara must work side by side with her ex-husband, Det. Jeffrey Tolliver, whom she loves despite his past infidelity, but it's Lena Adams, formerly a cop and now a campus security guard, whose story the novel follows most closely. Still mourning the murder of her sister and recovering from her own torture and rape by the same man, Lena is looked on with suspicion by her ex-boss, Jeffrey. With reason: she's hiding a few key facts. The dead boy's mother is her therapist and Lena is involved with an abusive young man with a shady past. Campus gossip Richard Carter further confuses investigators; meanwhile, police discover the bodies of two more students, their deaths potentially suicides but more likely murder. Slaughter provides grisly variations on the themes of sibling rivalry, sexual abuse and campus politics in a story not for the faint of heart. Readers who can stomach gruesome details and like fitting together multiple stories of physical and psychological abuse will savor the way Slaughter can evoke sympathy for perverse, even criminal, behavior by tracing its origins, and those who make it through the complexities and the gore will be rewarded with a satisfyingly chilling ending.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

        "0091800951": "Bestselling British author Harris (Pompeii;Enigma) returns to ancient Rome for this entertaining and enlightening novel of Marcus Cicero's rise to power. Narrated by a household slave named Tiro, who actually served as Cicero's \"confidential secretary\" for 36 years, this fictional biography follows the statesman and orator from his early career as an outsider&mdash;a \"new man\" from the provinces&mdash;to his election to the consulship, Rome's highest office, in 64 B.C. Loathed by the aristocrats, Cicero lived by his wits in a tireless quest for imperium&mdash;the ultimate power of life and death&mdash;and achieves \"his life's ambition\" after uncovering a plot by Marcus Crassus and Julius Caesar to rig the elections and seize control of the government. Harris's description of Rome's labyrinthine, and sometimes deadly, political scene is fascinating and instructive. The action is relentless, and readers will be disappointed when Harris leaves Cicero at the moment of his greatest triumph. Given Cicero's stormy consulship, his continuing opposition to Julius Caesar and his own assassination, readers can only hope a sequel is in the works.

Indeed, while Michael Stirling, dubbed the Merry Rake, is charming enough, subdued Francesca Bridgerton rarely seems worthy of his pursuit. All is well at the novel's outset, aside from the fact that Michael covets his cousin, the Earl of Kilmartin's, wife. Then, barely two chapters into the book, his cousin suffers an aneurysm and dies. Devastated and unable to cope with his new position as earl and his feelings for Francesca, Michael flees to India for four years, only to return still very much in love and suffering from malaria. In London, the two attend social events, trade quips and try to restore their friendship, but the more intimate they become, the more their feelings of guilt gnaw at them. Guilt is the only thing that stands in the way of the couple's happiness, and it's often frustrating to witness their slow, overwrought progression from denial to acceptance. While this book possesses some of the qualities that Quinn's fans have come to expect&mdash;sprightly prose, feverish love scenes and well-developed secondary characters&mdash;it is weighed down by the sheer intensity of the protagonists' grief.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "B00005B8G1": "The Game Boy platform (which includes the original unit, the Game Boy Pocket, and the Game Boy Color) came to market when most video game consoles had a life expectancy of just a few years. More than a decade later, the system is still going strong. How did the Game Boy successfully compete--and in some cases bury--an onslaught of faster, more powerful handheld and home console systems? Let us count the ways: affordability, a huge library of games that consistently made the most of the hardware's limitations, smart power management that extended battery life, and uncluttered controls. But perhaps it was the system's ultraportable design that allowed devotees to play video games around their schedule, making it the must-have system for kids and adults alike.Now the Game Boy Advance (or GBA as people are already calling it) comes to us with power that would have been unthinkable back in the day. The portable's 32-bit RISC CPU runs circles around the former's 8-bit workhorse, allowing it to process program instructions much faster. What that means to everyday gamers is more intricate visuals, more simultaneous movement on the screen, and better sound. In fact, the often-annoying beeps and boops of old-school Game Boy titles are being replaced with digitized stereo sound. The extra processing muscle also means you can even network up to four Game Boy Advance units together, via the communication cable, for multiplayer fun off of one shared cartridge. Only two Game Boy Color units could link together, and each unit had to have its own copy of the game.What's not being replaced, however, is the wide selection of Game Boy games. Because the Game Boy Advance system is backward-compatible, it will play its own line of colorful games--including such launch titles asSuper Mario Advance,F-Zero: Maximum Velocity,Army Men Advance,High Heat Major League Baseball 2002,Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, andReady 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2--as well as all of the monochrome and color games that have already been released for the previous Game Boy systems (nearly 500 in total). Players can view the older games in their smaller, originally square dimensions, or, with the touch of the shoulder button, expand the game to fit the GBA's larger screen. We tried enlarging the screen on a Game Boy Color edition ofTony Hawk's Pro Skater 2and found that Mr. Hawk was much easier to see.When you first pick up the system, you'll be amazed at how lightweight it is. At fewer than 5 ounces and a little larger than a deck of playing cards, the system easily fits into a shirt pocket without any sag. The GBA's wider shape fits better into a wider range of hands. The former design too often pushed the left and right thumb knuckles together during gameplay. The new layout should be comfortable for all ages, and the center screen orientation makes it easy to see.Game Boy Color owners will find the GBA's larger screen somewhat darker than they're used to, but that's because the screen is outfitted with antiglare technology. Like the old Game Boy Color, the color LCD is not backlit, so you need pretty good light to play by. Unlike that system, though, you won't be craning your neck and tilting the unit to see around the hot-spot reflection of the light bulb in your screen.But you'll also notice the graphics. Sporting what's basically a redesigned SNES technology, you'll see things on the GBA that the big consoles do, such as scaling (making objects larger or smaller) and rotation effects--technological advances that will affect the look of everything from crossing a finish line to throwing a touchdown pass to crawling through a dungeon.Some might argue that Nintendo could have tried to put even more power into this Game Boy Advance. After all, the 32-bit video game had its heyday more than five years ago. Perhaps, but after handling this new handheld, we're inclined to think that Nintendo wisely struck a balance between size, price, and power consumption. And considering how well the old 8-bit system weathered the decade's technological storms, we think the Game Boy Advance is here to stay, and we're glad.--Porter B.

        "0061031127": "Set in her native St. Petersburg, Russia, Simons's latest thick novel (after Tully, etc.) focuses on a WWII love affair. As the story opens, Tatiana, the youngest member of the Metanova family, is just 17; she still shares a bed with her older sister, Dasha. Not long after the country goes to war with Germany, Tatiana meets Alexander, a soldier, and sparks fly. It turns out, however, that Alexander is the same soldier Dasha has been crowing about. Possessed of a strong sense of family loyalty, and living under conditions that permit no privacy, Tatiana refuses to interfere with her sister's happiness, but the attraction between Tatiana and Alexander proves too powerful. Complicating matters, another soldier, Dimitri, has information that could destroy Alexander, and Dimitri likes Tatiana, too. In order to protect both Dasha's feelings and Alexander's life, the star-crossed lovers become part of a deceptive quadrangle as war intensifies around them. Taking her title from a tragic poem by Alexandr Pushkin, Simons skillfully highlights the ironies of the socialist utopia. Despite the novel's sprawling length and its seemingly epic scope, the nearly single-minded focus on dialogue between Tatiana and Alexander leaves other character development shortchanged and the reader with the impression of a peculiarly tiny canvas.

        "B0002A6CQ4": "The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect. It looks too good to be trueSound:Great voice acting, stress-inducing music, and disturbing sound effects combine to create the perfect atmospherePlayability:The controls are fashioned beautifully, boss fights are ingenious, and the popping of heads is immensely rewardingEntertainment:Hard to put down even after you've beaten it twiceReplay:Moderately HighRated:10 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:Some games are simply destined to become milestones in gaming history, and Resident Evil 4 is one of them. Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it. Capcom has managed to create a game that is a complete reinvention of the series &#8211; even the entire genre &#8211; without losing anything that Resident Evil fans expect. Perfectly balancing elements of horror, subtlety, and wit with explosive action and over-the-top thrills, playing RE 4 feels like living one of the most epic films you've ever seen. Gorgeous to look at, a dream to control, and filled with some of the most exciting moments you've experienced in a game, Resident Evil 4 is stellar on every level. It goes without saying that it's the best in the series, the best survival horror game yet, and simply one of the best games ever made.Rated:10 out of 10Editor:Jeremy ZossSubscribe to Game Informer--Amazon.com",
        "0061626813": "A former religion reporter for theLos Angeles Times, Lobdell recounts in this plainly written memoir how he became a Protestant evangelical, nearly accepted Catholicism and, in the end, rejected faith altogether. Central to the arc of this memoir is the unfolding sexual abuse scandal in the Roman Catholic Church, which Lobdell covered in depth during his time as a religion reporter, beginning in 2000. Despairing of the role of priests and bishops in that scandal, he refashions his identity as a crusading reporter out to cleanse the church of corrupt leaders. But after finding that his investigative stories about faith healer Benny Hinn and televangelists Jan and Paul Crouch appear to make no difference on the reach of these ministries or the lives of their followers, he gives up on the beat and on religion generally. Lobdell subjects his faith to the rigors of rationalism. If Christians are no more ethical than atheists, why belong to a church? It's a curious utilitarian argument that sounds more like a rearview explanation than a revealing account of loss of faith. Still, the memoir's strength lies in the wrenching emotional toll exacted by the Catholic abuse scandal. If nothing else, it suggests reporters may have been victimized by the scandal, too.(Mar.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

        "0061236276": "Kindergarten-Grade 5&mdash;Benjamin Britten's \"Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra\" has been the gold standard for introducing children to instruments since 1946. The concept has been embraced (some may say enhanced) by none other than Lemony Snicket, whose picture-book overview offers the additional layer of a murder mystery. The CD presentation features music by Nathaniel Stookey, performed by the San Francisco Symphony. The story is well paced, employing wordplay, humor, and mild suspense to build a slow crescendo that originates with the delicate strings and climaxes with percussion. The bombastic Inspector, read by Snicket on the CD, sports pinstripes, a bowler hat, and a handlebar mustache in the book. As he interrogates each section of the orchestra, the instruments describe their whereabouts on the night of the crime in characteristic voices, telling something about their actual roles while offering imagery for the illustrator. Thus, \"'We were performing a waltz,' said the Violins. 'We played graceful melodies so the ladies and gentlemen could spin around and around and around until they felt dizzy and somewhat nauseous.'\" Ellis's watercolors combine caricatures of the action with silhouettes of the instruments. Evidence leads to the conductor, since \"wherever there's a conductor, you're sure to find a dead composer!\" Musings on justice versus art point to certain acquittal. Due to the length of the musical portions, it is unlikely that children will listen and read simultaneously. It is quite likely, however, that both formats will provide entertainment and enlightenment, in whatever order they are encountered.&mdash;Wendy Lukehart, Washington DC Public LibraryCopyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0099450259": "Mark Haddon's bitterly funny debut novel,The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, is a murder mystery of sorts--one told by an autistic version of Adrian Mole. Fifteen-year-old Christopher John Francis Boone is mathematically gifted and socially hopeless, raised in a working-class home by parents who can barely cope with their child's quirks. He takes everything that he sees (or is told) at face value, and is unable to sort out the strange behavior of his elders and peers.Late one night, Christopher comes across his neighbor's poodle, Wellington, impaled on a garden fork. Wellington's owner finds him cradling her dead dog in his arms, and has him arrested. After spending a night in jail, Christopher resolves--against the objection of his father and neighbors--to discover just who has murdered Wellington. He is encouraged by Siobhan, a social worker at his school, to write a book about his investigations, and the result--quirkily illustrated, with each chapter given its own prime number--isThe Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time.Haddon's novel is a startling performance. This is the sort of book that could turn condescending, or exploitative, or overly sentimental, or grossly tasteless very easily, but Haddon navigates those dangers with a sureness of touch that is extremely rare among first-time novelists.The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Timeis original, clever, and genuinely moving: this one is a must-read.--Jack Illingworth, Amazon.ca--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",
        "006178480X": "Rollins&#x2019; latest Sigma Force thriller verges on science fiction. A satellite crashes in Mongolia, but before it does, it transmits what appears to be an image of Boston, New York City, and Washington, D.C., in ruins. The image, it turns out, is time-shifted from the very near future by about 90 hours (there&#x2019;s a rather laborious scientific explanation for how this could happen). As Painter Crowe, head of Sigma, tries to understand the situation, operative Gray Pierce learns of an ancient relic that seems to predict imminent disaster. In four days, the end of the world begins, and can even the highly skilled Sigma team stop something as big as that? As usual, there&#x2019;s a historical element to the story&#x2014;this time involving Attila the Hun, Genghis Khan, and Genghis&#x2019; legendary hidden treasure&#x2014;but it&#x2019;s the fast-paced action that carries us through to the end. Sure, the Sigma Force novels are formulaic (modern-day threat, ancient mystery, a team of experts who risk their lives to avert disaster at the last minute), but when the formula generates this much excitement, should we really mind? --David Pitt",

        "006121468X": "Starred Review. Grade 9 Up&mdash;This urban fairy tale, a sequel toWicked Lovely(HarperTeen, 2007), is impossible to put down. Leslie lives with a father who has given up on life, a drug-abusing brother who allowed his dealer to rape Leslie in lieu of payment, and a burning desire to banish pain and fear from her life. Unable to confide in her best friend, Aislinn, she devotes herself to working to pay the family bills and to get the tattoo she believes will help her reclaim her body. What she doesn't know is that the art she has selected will bind her to Irial, the king of the Dark Court of Fairy. He removes her emotions like fear, panic, or anger, and uses them to nourish the fairies of his court. What Irial doesn't expect is his growing love for Leslie and her desire to make her own choices. In Leslie, Marr has created a damaged, wounded character who still comes across as being incredibly strong. Irial needs to care for his court, knowing them too weak to win a war, but his feelings for Leslie make him unwilling to do what needs to be done. The lesser characters are also well drawn: Rabbit the tattoo artist, his father, Gabriel, and also Aislinn, Keenan, and Seth fromWicked Lovely. While reading that book first would give more shades to some of the characters, it isn't necessary to appreciate the intricate world that Marr creates.&mdash;Lisa Prolman, Greenfield Public Library, MACopyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "B0028ZNX68": "Although theGuitar Heroseries has only been around since 2005, the gobs of exposure--or  perhaps over exposure--that it has received has fueled an understandable amount of skepticism among many gamers regarding the future of the overall franchise. After all, once a music game has conquered single player, two-player, artist-specific, full band multiplayer and handheld action, where does it go? Answer: into the DJ booth withDJ Hero.Recently I was able to spend some time with a Xbox 360 demo of the game that has been making the rounds, and here is what I came away with..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; }  ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; }  table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; }  td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }Challenge yourself with realistic DJ gameplay mechanics and multiple point multipliers.View          larger.Put your old Guitar Hero axe to work in DJ and Guitar mode.View          larger.Go head-to-head against a friend in DJ vs. DJ mode.View          larger.Action inDJ Herorevolves around aGuitar Herostyle note highway which streams color coated prompts toward the player, in the role of DJ, who input these via the bundled game-specific wireless turntable/mixer controller. The turntable portion of the controller is made up of a realistic platter that spins all the way around in both directions when pushed by the player and has familiar green, red and blue buttons attached on top. The mixer half has a sliding three-position fader bar, a button used to activate star power like \"Euphoria\" gameplay sections which temporarily double point multipliers, an effects knob and a hidden control panel containing your console's standard navigational buttons. Gameplay takes you through pre matched, two-jam tracks, with the green and blue buttons oriented on the left and right edges of the note highway and on the platter representing these, and the red button in the middle providing  a spot to add samples, which can be changed at various times in the game with the effects knob. Players must perform three main types of DJ actions when prompted by the note highway: taps, which are beat matching actions requiring the pushing of buttons on the platter;  fader bar moves indicating either a selection of one of the two tracks during the jam, or a mix of the two; and scratching, which entails selecting one of the two tracks on the platter and moving the turntable quickly up and down. In addition, players can activate Euphoria strategically, as success throughout sections of a track fills the Euphoria meter at the left, and shoot for the additional bonus of a Rewind, given for perfection in certain sections, and allowing the player to replay that same section again for additional points.It's interesting how this latest release in the series parallels the historical deconstructive trend  in actual pop music, which saw Hip-hop, Electronica, House, and other musical genres rise through the use of DJ sampling and mixing techniques, but does this mean thatDJ Herowill enjoy as much success and be as good a play experience as some of theHerogames that came before it? Only time will tell, but after a few hours breaking it down on the DJ deck myself, it seems to me that the game has a major thing going against it, and an equally important positive thing going for it that together will probably decide this for most players. The negative is that the controller used is a bit more difficult to operate than any used in earlier games, except perhaps the drums ofGuitar Hero World Tour, while the positive is that the overall gameplay is as fun and infectious as any seen in the series.To be clear, the controller issues alluded to are by no means a deal breaker. More than anything else, what the vast majority of players will be challenged by in theDJ Herocontroller is their unfamiliarity with a DJ deck. As popular as DJ influenced music is in reality, not too many fans per capita have had hands-on experience with the tools of the trade, unlike the legions ofGuitar Herofans, purchasing in their millions, who are at least somewhat familiar with how a guitar, drum and microphone work. Another inconvenience related to the controller is its fairly cramped layout, with both sections residing right next to each other and no apparent way to create space between the two pieces without disconnecting them. This is enhanced by the fact that in many cases the controller may be more easily worked from a high platform in front of the standing player, potentially making this lack of space even more of a problem. But as with any new controller type, muscle memory will kick in with practice and players become more comfortable with the basic DJ mechanics of the game. There are also some simple hints doled out by the in-game tutorials that should be heeded, like when scratching make sure to let go at the end of each scratch, and anchor your hand to the turntable deck with your thumb to avoid spinning the platter too wildly. Also, the two pieces of the controller can be swapped to allow for left-handed play, and thankfullyDJ Hero's development team recognized that discouraged players are not a good thing and did away with the familiarGuitar Heroscenario of AI audiences booing a player off the stage. If you are screwing up they will still let you know, but at least players will always get the experience of finishing. At the end of each set you are rated at 1-5 stars, where the more stars you get the more tracks are unlocked and DJ gear is made available to you. The gradual organization of the game's four play settings also help you build confidence by introducing more advanced skills as you progress. In Easy, players primarily use tapping and a simplified form of scratching. The Medium setting adds fader bar functionality. Play on the Hard level requires precise directional scratching, where you must scratch in the same direction as the note highway. The assumption is that Expert level bumps things up even farther, although this level was not available with the demo played.Finally, as part of the fun built into the game, players can expect various ways to play and experience the game. These include a variety of gameplay modes including single player, a head-to-head multiplayer DJ vs. DJ mode where two players work their way through the same track for the best possible point total, the multiplayer Guitar and DJ mode which is compatible with allGuitar Heroguitars made for the same platform, and Party Mode where scoring is turned off and you can just listen to the 80+ unique mixes by big name DJs included in the game. And as with all games in theGuitar Heroseries players can expect some pretty deep character customization options to be made available as their skills rise.Taken together does all this equate to a quality music gameplay experience? Well, what I've seen is pretty solid, so if you are a fan of bothGuitar Herotype gameplay and DJ music and culture, I'd say you almost certainly will not be disappointed. Also, with its new controller, as well as different and in many places, challenging gameplay, if you are more interested inDJ Heroas a departure from series' very well-worn gameplay mold, you will probably be equally happy.Tom Milnes, Amazon.com/games freelance contributor",

Pepperberg, who teaches animal cognition, has previously documented the results of her 30-year relationship with Alex inThe Alex Studies. While this book inevitably covers some of the same ground, it is a moving tribute that beautifully evokes the struggles, the initial triumphs, the setbacks, the unexpected and often stunning achievements during a groundbreaking scientific endeavor spent uncovering cognitive abilities in Alex that no one believed were possible, and challenging science's deepest assumptions about the origin of human cognitive abilities. Pepperberg deftly interweaves her own personal narrative&mdash;including her struggles to gain recognition for her research&mdash;with more intimate scenes of life with Alex than she was able to present in her earlier work, creating a story that scientists and laypeople can equally enjoy, if they can all keep from crying over Alex's untimely death.(Nov.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It matters little that each wonderful vignette has nothing to do with the one that follows. (We move seamlessly from a one-humped Wump and Mister Gump to yellow pets called the Zeds with one hair upon their heads.)

A brave New World is rising--a hostile yet beautiful world, filled with innovative gameplay, new strategic scenarios, eye-searing graphics and much more. Welcome to a world calledAge of Empires III.CampaignIn this action adventure tale of historical fiction, players take on the role of Morgan Black and his family, struggling against the hostile wilderness and a mysterious cult that's crept in from Europe.In a series of 24 scenarios divided into three acts, Morgan Black and his descendants help the Aztecs resist conquest by Spanish conquistadors, pit the French against the British in the French and Indian War and help Simon Bolivar lead revolutions in South America.MultiplayerWhether you're searching for a quick game or hoping to talk strategy with friends online,Age of Empires III's Multiplayer site is your community destination.Here, you can play with persistent Home Cities that gain power and strategic options the more games you play, compete for a spot on dozens of ladders, help organize your clan or chat after a game -- all without leaving the multiplayer portal.Fans ofAge of Mythology's Quick Search can still look for games swiftly, while players looking for something specific can browse game lists to find the set of options that matches their tastes.New Feature--Home CitiesThis revolutionary new feature to the RTS landscape is incorporated into all aspects ofAge of Empires III-- from Campaign to Multiplayer -- and is unlike anything you've experienced before.Much like the persistent character from a role-playing game that encourages you to keep playing, your Home City is an important support system to your efforts in the New World. During a game, your Home City can regularly send you supplies or military reinforcements.You are the leader of your colony, but your success brings glory back to Mother Europe. The more games you play, and the better you do, the more powerful your Home City will become. Every few games, you gain the ability to both upgrade and customize your Home City:Upgrade your city by unlocking new types of soldiers or buildings, or improving those you already have.Broaden your tech tree in whatever direction most fits your play style--invest in warships, native alliances, cavalry, artillery or economy.Customize your Home City by changing the appearance of buildings, the weather or even the types of people who walk, work and perform in its streets.Throughout a game, as well as in between games, you can visit your Home City to watch its citizens go about their lives, get an opinion on how you're doing, plot your next move or just marvel at the beautiful sunset.Full 3-D Graphics, Destructible Environments and MoreWe first set out to reproduce the rich detail ofAge of Empires II: Age of Kings. As we strove to make the fascinatingAge of Empires IIItime period come alive, that goal quickly evolved: We at Ensemble Studios wanted to create the best-looking game ever. From the stunning water effects to the hundreds of units battling on-screen, you'll feel like you're a part of the action in the New World.Tone mapping--This photo imaging technique balances the colors in a scene on the fly. The end result is a rich, warm game where bright colors are vibrantly rendered alongside darker counterparts, such as shadows.Lighting and shadows--The sun is always shining inAge of Empires, so it's important that lighting and shadows be an awe-inspiring experience. Units and buildings cast shadows according to a real sun position, and even cast shadows on each other. High Dynamic Range rendering allows us to represent the shiny glints of sunlight that bounce off highly reflective surfaces.Bump and specular mapping--Water glistens like water. Metal shines like metal. These advanced techniques serve to provide an extra level of rendering detail heretofore unseen in real-time strategy (RTS) gaming.Water--We felt that portraying stunning, realistic water effects in the game was so important that we devoted a programmer to it full-time. You'll find the water rich with details like foam near the shore, accurately modeled water motion, flotsam in rivers and realistic water colors. Plus, reflections change with the viewing angle, the angle of sunlight and the motion of the water. The overall effect is breathtaking.Cliffs and Riverbeds--Instead of just stretching terrain, we built a system to attach geometry to the terrain map to allow for realistic overhangs and steep cliffs, from areas like the American Southwest. This effect is supported on random maps too.CivilizationsBritishQuick access to Settlers gives the British one of the strongest economies in the game. The ability to upgrade two key units -- the Musketeer and Hussar -- make the British military formidable in the late game. The British Home City emphasizes improvements to technology and naval warfare.DutchAlthough Dutch Settlers are limited and costly, their civilization makes up for this economic disadvantage by building Banks and generating coin automatically. The Dutch Home City emphasizes upgrades to defense and economy.FrenchAlthough the French economy starts slowly, the Coureur unit, a Villager with strong fighting skills, makes the French difficult to attack early. The French also have the strongest cavalry unit in the game -- the Cuirassier. Plus, the French are experts at allying with the Native Americans.GermanThe Germans have fewer Settlers and therefore a slower economy. Fortunately, both the Settler Wagon and Uhlan cavalry spawn for free from the German Town Center. Plus, the Germans start with the ability to send Mercenaries from their Home City (long before other civilizations can).Native AmericanEuropean civilizations can learn new technologies and gain troops by forging alliances with the Native Americans. A British player who allies with the Iroquois is essentially playing as two civilizations: the British and the Iroquois.OttomanFor the Ottomans, Settlers spawn automatically from the Town Center. Building a Mosque and conducting research help keep that Settler production steady. Befitting their position straddling Europe and Asia, the Ottomans have more unique units than any other civilization.PortugueseStarting the game with two Town Centers, the Portuguese can quickly produce Settlers, control territory or support their allies. The Spyglass ability allows the Portuguese to easily spy on the enemy. The Portuguese also have a strong navy, strong light infantry and the best Dragoons in the game.RussianStarting the game with extra resources but fewer Settlers gives the Russians the flexibility of focusing on economy or an early raid. Russian infantry, individually weak, are trained in blocks at a faster rate, providing the Russians with the opportunity to overwhelm their enemy with greater numbers.SpanishThe Spanish have a strong military, with both hand infantry and cavalry. Flexibility in early shipments from the Home City give the Spanish the option to attack early or set up for a strong, late economy. Spanish Home City improvements benefit soldiers, buildings and naval units.&nbsp;CombatAge of Empires IIIgives players an amazing amount of control over their side of the battlefield.More to command -- Not only are you in command of large and diverse armies of infantry, cavalry and artillery, but also Native American warriors, mercenaries and tall ships.Multiple formations -- You can assign different formations to your army for different strengths and weaknesses, or have the game automatically choose the most appropriate formation. Examples include:Volley -- ranged infantry, like musketeers, take turns firing at enemies ahead of them.Charge -- your soldiers walk, then run into combat. Cavalry wield sabers, and musketeers fix bayonets. This formation does tremendous damage but makes your soldiers more prone to injury.Bombard -- your soldiers protect the cannons, while the cannons shell enemy ranks. Available only when you have artillery in your army.Battles are easier to follow -- You can still command individual units. But when the units fight in formation, you'll be able to tell exactly who is winning the fight.Real-time physics -- Infantry struck by cannon fire will be thrown like rag dolls, perhaps even over a cliff and into the water. Cannonballs bounce and ricochet.Detailed destructions -- Shingles, shutters and whole towers may fly off a building and interact with the terrain, such as crashing into nearby water. This next generation effect is done on the fly so that each building always has a unique destruction, no matter how many times you see it.Unique animations -- With hundreds of unique combat animations, you'll never see the same battle twice.",

        "0060593083": "InQuicksilver, the first volume of the \"Baroque Cycle,\" Neal Stephenson launches his most ambitious work to date. The novel, divided into three books, opens in 1713 with the ageless Enoch Root seeking Daniel Waterhouse on the campus of what passes for MIT in eighteenth-century Massachusetts. Daniel, Enoch's message conveys, is key to resolving an explosive scientific battle of preeminence between Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz over the development of calculus. As Daniel returns to London aboard theMinerva, readers are catapulted back half a century to recall his years at Cambridge with young Isaac. Daniel is a perfect historical witness. Privy to Robert Hooke's early drawings of microscope images and with associates among the English nobility, religious radicals, and the Royal Society, he also befriends Samuel Pepys, risks a cup of coffee, and enjoys a lecture on Belgian waffles and cleavage-&#x97;all before the year 1700.In the second book, Stephenson introduces Jack Shaftoe and Eliza. \"Half-Cocked\" Jack (also know as the \"King of the Vagabonds\") recovers the English Eliza from a Turkish harem. Fleeing the siege of Vienna, the two journey across Europe driven by Eliza's lust for fame, fortune, and nobility. Gradually, their circle intertwines with that of Daniel in the third book of the novel.The book courses with Stephenson's scholarship but is rarely bogged down in its historical detail. Stephenson is especially impressive in his ability to represent dialogue over the evolving worldview of seventeenth-century scientists and enliven the most abstruse explanation of theory. Though replete with science, the novel is as much about the complex struggles for political ascendancy and the workings of financial markets. Further, the novel's literary ambitions match its physical size. Stephenson narrates through epistolary chapters, fragments of plays and poems, journal entries, maps, drawings, genealogic tables, and copious contemporary epigrams. But, caught in this richness, the prose is occasionally neglected and wants editing. Further, anticipating a cycle, the book does not provide a satisfying conclusion to its 900 pages. These are minor quibbles, though. Stephenson has matched ambition to execution, and his faithful, durable readers will be both entertained and richly rewarded with a practicum in Baroque science, cypher, culture, and politics.--Patrick O'Kelley--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

If the name switch signals the author's desire to change writing styles, then she's certainly achieved her goal. The Trocheck books are mostly formulaic comic whodunits, but this supremely entertaining story sets Andrews up to be a southern Susan Isaacs. Mary Bliss is so busy propping up her best friend, Katharine, who's coping with her broken marriage by drinking gin and buying expensive toys, that she fails to notice her own marriage is in trouble. Her once dependable husband, Palmer, has cleaned out their accounts and left her with a pile of debt. In desperation, she takes a job as a product-demonstration hostess, but her salary will barely cover the electric bill. She allows Katharine to talk her into a cockeyed scheme to have Palmer declared dead so she can collect the insurance. That's when she meets sexy fraud investigator Matt Hayslip, and things really start to heat up. A breezy story fairly brimming with good spirits and feisty humor.Joanne WilkinsonCopyright &#169; American Library Association.

        "0061779768": "*Starred Review* What do you get when you stitch Othello, The Merchant of Venice, and &#x201C;The Cask of Amontillado&#x201D; together? Well, you get this rollickin&#x2019; adventure in which Pocket, the royal fool introduced in Moore&#x2019;s Fool (2009), is lured to Venice, where he thinks he&#x2019;ll be having a fun time with the beautiful Portia, but where three men (including a fella named Iago) are actually planning to murder him. To some, the idea of combining two Shakespeare plays and an Edgar Allan Poe short story might be vaguely chilling. To begin with, Moore, author of such delights as Sacre Blue (2012) and The Stupidest Angel (2004), has to move the events of the plays from the late sixteenth century to the thirteenth to keep the chronology in line with the events recounted in Fool, which means &#x201C;Amontillado&#x201D; is moved roughly 500 years back in time. And let&#x2019;s not forget that the plays are tragedies, whereas this book, which also interpolates elements of King Lear, from which Fool was derived, is a farce. The upshot is, if you&#x2019;re the kind of reader who insists Shakespeare is untouchable, then this novel will probably annoy you on general principles. On the other hand, if you&#x2019;re a fan of Moore&#x2019;s brand of history-mangling humor, you&#x2019;ll dive right in with a big grin on your face. The grins win in the end. --David Pitt",

The inclusion of subtitle \"Origins\" in the game's title refers to the six unique origin stories available to new heroes as a new game begins. Each of these has an impact on the player's motivations and his or her experience, and renders a unique prelude, path, and possible ending(s) to the game. There are many different endings to the game based on the origin story of the character and the choices you make as you play through the game. The game features three character classes--warrior, mage, and rogue--and three races of being--Human, Elf or Dwarf--that can assume these classes. Although most game elements, such as weapons, magic, etc., are available to any character, each class and race has different strengths, abilities and affinities which lend themselves to better utilizing different elements.Dragon Age: Originsis a single player game based on party-based gameplay and combat where the player can join, control and quest with up to three non-player characters (NPCs). Players can also quest alone if they so choose, but with the chance of survival are slim. Convincing NPCs to join you, and treating them well may be necessary depending on the varying sentiments between the player and the NPC, or between the NPC's in the party based on the chosen history written into the origin story accepted at the beginning of the game. This uncertainty allows for a variety of possible dynamics within the party ranging from open hostility, all the way to romance. The game progresses in real-time via a pause-and-play tactical combat system that allows the player to check inventory levels, equip a character, etc. in a slight vacuum.

The bodies of most overeaters are continually in a state of hyperinsulinism; their bodies are so adept at releasing insulin to help convert excess carbohydrates to fat that there's always too much of the hormone circulating through the body. This puts the body into a bind; it always wants to store fat. Even when people with hyperinsulinism try to lose weight--especially when they cut fat but increase carbohydrate consumption--their efforts will fail. This is why Dr. Atkins refers to insulin as &quot;the fat-producing hormone.&quot;Dr. Atkins's diet is extremely low in carbohydrates, which helps to regulate insulin production and decrease circulating insulin; less insulin soon results in less fat storage and fewer food cravings. The diet is far from torturous, though--those who've tried it attest that hunger isnota part of this plan. Ninety percent of Dr. Atkins's patients--more than 25,000 of them--have experienced dramatic weight loss.

She wakes up with no memory of what happened. She thinks it's the next day, but is terrified to discover five years have passed and she hasn't aged a day. Her mother's remarried, her boyfriend Austin's in college and dating her best friend, and her fastidious father has become a drunken conspiracy theorist who believes she was abducted by aliens. The only comfort and support she gets is from Austin's little brother, Tyler, an extremely grown-up and very cute 17-year-old. Her father's theories don't seem that crazy as Kyra begins manifesting new physical abilities&#x2014;she rarely feels tired or needs to eat and heals quickly. After several people whom she's come into close contact with die and sinister National Security Agency agents swarm her house wearing hazmat suits, the mysterious boy who helps her get away confirms her fears. Like him, Kyra is one of the Returned. She's more deadly to others, especially Tyler, than she ever imagined. Readers will sympathize with Kyra's predicament, although she's frequently self-centered and the story dwells too much on her and Tyler's mutual attraction. The characters' memory loss means there's no backstory about why they disappeared in the first place. Hopefully, that will be further explained in the next book in the projected trilogy. Nevertheless, the exciting plot zips along, leaving readers impatiently waiting for the next installment.&#x2014;Sharon Rawlins, New Jersey State Library, Trenton",

        "0099513021": "With a bit of sibling rivalry, some incestuous Greek gods, and good ol' contemporary London, Phillips puts together an amusing epic journey with perhaps a bit less pizzazz than Homer. Jealous of Neil, a mortal, because Alice loves him, Apollo schemes to bring about Alice's demise, but his sister Artemis won't let dead mortals lie. Needing a hero for a journey, she enlists the timid Neil to go into Hades and recover Alice (and save the world while he's at it). Phillips's tale is a delightful flight of fancy into the world of what would the Greek gods do that is adequately abridged, though listeners may want to hear the full extent of the characters' exploits. Tom Sellwood delivers in an English accent that works well with the setting. He ably projects the various gods' and goddesses' personas through their dialogue, so Apollo's arrogance is heard as well as Ares' more aggressive personality. Sellwood is at his best as Neil, the dry and mild-mannered engineer who gets caught up in the games of the gods.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0061941026": "Lamb&#x2019;s much-anticipated new novel explores the secrets of a Connecticut family on the occasion of mother Annie&#x2019;s remarriage to another woman. An artist who has found great success recycling junk into angry visual art, Annie is ambivalent about marrying Viveca, the art dealer responsible for her success. Meanwhile, Annie&#x2019;s ex-husband, Orion, struggles to accept Annie&#x2019;s remarriage and remake himself after messing up his career as a psychologist. And their kids are not exactly all right either. But, in classic Lamb fashion, this is less a story about the drama of the present or any of the various hot-button issues Lamb invokes (gay marriage, Christian Fundamentalism, Obama&#x2019;s presidency) than it is a lesson about how the traumas of the past play themselves out in the present, and how moral courage and religious faith are the key to overcoming that which haunts us. Here the old wounds are deep indeed&#x2014;abandonment, addiction, decades-old racial conflict, and lots of child abuse&#x2014;and Lamb does not hold back describing them in all their messiness. As he did in his Oprah-endorsed blockbusters She&#x2019;s Come Undone (1992) and I Know This Much Is True (1998), Lamb avoids irony and tends to spoon-feed his readers rather than let them find their own meanings in the text. But few authors are as compassionate toward their characters or as stirring in their redemption narratives. Librarians should expect heavy demand.

The new faction to the series is the Empire of the Rising Sun, derived from Imperial Japan, with an all-new cast of units and characters.The three factions have many differences, exemplified by their wildly different types of units. The Soviets, for example, have armored attack bears, Allies have the Dolphin ship which can high jump and use a sonic attack, and the Empire of the Rising Sun features such quirky units as a giant transforming mecha and ninjas.

        "0099451956": "Caldwell and Thomason's intriguing intellectual suspense novel stars four brainy roommates at Princeton, two of whom have links to a mysterious 15th-century manuscript, theHypnerotomachia Poliphili. This rare text (a real book) contains embedded codes revealing the location of a buried Roman treasure. Comparisons toThe Da Vinci Codeare inevitable, but Caldwell and Thomason's book is the more cerebral-and better written-of the two: think Dan Brown by way of Donna Tartt and Umberto Eco. The four seniors are Tom Sullivan, Paul Harris, Charlie Freeman and Gil Rankin. Tom, the narrator, is the son of a Renaissance scholar who spent his life studying the ancient book, \"an encyclopedia masquerading as a novel, a dissertation on everything from architecture to zoology.\" The manuscript is also an endless source of fascination for Paul, who sees it as \"a siren, a fetching song on a distant shore, all claws and clutches in person. You court her at your risk.\" This debut novel's range of topics almost rivals theHypnerotomachia's itself, including etymology, Renaissance art and architecture, Princeton eating clubs, friendship, steganography (riddles) and self-interpreting manuscripts. It's a complicated, intricate and sometimes difficult read, but that's the point and the pleasure. There are murders, romances, dangers and detection, and by the end the heroes are in a race not only to solve the puzzle, but also to stay alive. Readers might be tempted to buy their own copy of theHypnerotomachiaand have a go at the puzzle.

Naturally, Blazkowicz is the only thing standing in the Nazis' way, so he's set  behind enemy lines in an effort to end the madness.On the surface, the single-player game seems like pure gold--after all, everyone  loves killing Nazis. But the story jumps all over the place, the enemy AI is  less than impressive, and most gamers will be able to finish the game in a mere  10 to 15 hours. The single-player game falls short of the standards set by  titles such asHalf-LifeandNo One Lives Forever.In fact, the best thing aboutReturn to Castle Wolfensteinis its  team-based multiplayer mode. Each multiplayer adventure features Axis vs. Allies, and  both sides offer four character classes: engineer (removes obstacles), medic  (heals and revives teammates), lieutenant (calls in air strikes and replenishes  ammo), and soldier (only class able to use sniper rifles, flamethrowers, and  other unusual weapons). The game includes only eight multiplayer maps, but they  are all perfectly designed, and in order to be successful teams have to work  together. The result is a great gaming experience that fans ofCounter-Strikeor the Day of Defeat mode forHalf-Lifewill really  appreciate.Graphically,Return to Castle Wolfensteinlooks amazing. It uses the  powerfulQuake IIIengine to great effect, and the character models,  explosions, and lighting effects are all perfectly done.

The third time was not the charm: a second rescue mission disappeared in another blizzard, leaving neither clues nor apparent survivors. Subsequent attempts--some with fatal results--failed under the harsh conditions, forcing the men to weather the Arctic winter in makeshift shelters, including the tail section of a broken bomber. This tale of survival in the deadliest conditions would be enthralling on its own (and it is), but Zuckoff's meticulous research led him to a modern-day group dedicated to solving the mystery of the third flight.

As a private in the Russian army, you will fight off waves of invading German troops and Panzer tanks in Moscow and Stalingrad. Once you finish the Russian campaign, you'll go up against Field Marshal Rommel's troops in the deserts of North Africa. As part of this campaign, you'll race around in your own tank with others at your side, and later you'll be tasked with calling in air strikes against enemy tanks. The final campaign has you in the role of an American corporal in Europe, but unlike most WWII games, you won't perform a D-Day landing on Omaha or Utah Beach. InCall of Duty 2, you have to scale the cliffs of Pointe du Hoc with the Army Rangers amidst a hail of artillery and machine gun fire, giving you a true appreciation of the time-honored saying, \"War is Hell!\"Call of Duty 2is a thinking-gamer's first-person shooter of medium difficulty. While there are many reflexive elements, the game quite often requires you to consider the tactics of the situation in order to survive. While you can probably blow through the game in 10 hours on the regular setting, the more difficult settings require you to be much more thoughtful about your approach to the different scenarios. Your teammates in battle neither finish your fight, nor simply provide enemy fodder, while the enemy AI (artificial intelligence) is quite clever. If you are too meek, you will find yourself pinned down by aggressive fire while the enemy lobs grenades at you until you're decimated.Unlike the its predecessor,Call of Duty 2doesn't give you a health bar. Instead, as you are hit by more and more fire, your screen grows increasingly red around the border, and your character begins to grunt and pant. This is your signal that it's time to find some cover in order to recuperate before you continue. Another major improvement is the enhanced smoke grenades, which not only look great but can be used effectively in battle to obscure your path from tanks or machine-gun nests as you make your way to an objective.WhileCall of Duty 2has received an ESRB T (teen) rating -- meaning there are no gratuitous blood and guts splashing all over the screen -- this is still war, and there are enemies that will try to drag themselves to safety after being hit, only to be bludgeoned to a screaming death by your fellow men-at-arms. And like its older brother,Call of Duty 2offers the standard deathmatch, team deathmatch, capture-the-flag, and search-and-destroy multiplayer modes. However, this version offers a new option called \"headquarters,\" which most closely resembles the \"crazy king\" version of king-of-the-hill in Halo 2. Shifting headquarter points appear and must be captured in order to start building points, only to be overrun by the other side in order to halt that point gain. This version of the multiplayer mode is not only extremely fun, but it requires teams to adapt on the fly.Unlike the original, in this sequel you can skip forward from one mission to the next once you've cleared a campaign. The game also auto-detects 16:9 and 16:10 wide-screen ratios, as well as the sometimes tricky 5:4 ratio for LCD monitors. As the user, you can make use of a good set of performance tweaking functions, or you can allow the game to determine the optimal ratio, based on your system. With the addition of actual war footage as introductions to each campaign, and famous war quotes at the end of the scenes,Call of Duty 2has everything you need to lose yourself in the middle of the biggest war in history of the world.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

        "0062072188": "Amazon Exclusive: Daniel Silva on WritingPortrait of a Spywith a PencilWhile on book tour, I&rsquo;ve been surprised to find that readers are fascinated by how writers actually write. Most readers hold in their mind an idealized image of the novelist at work&mdash;a figure in a trendy urban coffeehouse, a solitary figure walking along an empty beach. The truth, however, is seldom so romantic.Before going any further, let us stipulate that, much like the hero of my novels, the art restorer and spy Gabriel Allon, I am something of a creature of habit. I work seven days a week, from early in the morning until six thirty in the evening, when I stop to watch the evening news. My work clothing never varies: gray sweatpants by Russell Athletic, a long-sleeve T-shirt by L.L. Bean, fleece Acorn moccasins, and discount cotton socks from Marks &amp; Spencer in England. Occasionally, visitors to our house will catch a glimpse of this outfit, but, for the most part, my wife and children tend to shield me from public view. As a rule, I don&rsquo;t answer the telephone&mdash;unless it is a family emergency of some sort&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t read e-mail. I nibble rather than eat.Portrait of a Spy, like all the Gabriel Allon novels, was fueled largely by McVitie&rsquo;s digestive biscuits.I have a computer, of course, but I really do most of my actualwritingin longhand, on yellow legal pads. I prefer to work while lying on the floor rather than at my desk. This annoys my wife because she took a great deal of time and effort to have a desk custom made to fit my office. When I showed her a photograph of Muriel Spark, one of her literary heroes, writing in longhand stretched across a floor, she was only partially mollified. Sometimes we talk about living somewhere other than Georgetown. Secretly, the very idea terrifies me. After writing 14 books in the same room of the same house, I am afraid I have lost the ability to work anywhere else.As for my writing instrument of choice, it is unquestionably the pencil. There is something about the sound it makes scratching across the page that, for me, is the essence of composition. The pencil is the antithesis of all things cyber and e, a means of returning, however briefly, to a world that is unconnected and unwired. A pad and pencil do not freeze or crash. There are no viruses or error messages. If a thunderstorm knocks out the power, the words will still be there when the lights come on again. And then, there is the satisfying natural rhythm of the work itself&mdash;the turning of the completed page, the sharpening of the dulled point, the fortnightly disposal of the fluffy wooden shavings.Lately, I have been hoarding pencils. I&rsquo;m not sure precisely when it began; I suspect it had something to do with the death of the typewriter. An irrational fear gripped me, a fear that pencils were next. If the typewriter could go extinct, how could the lowly, environmentally hostile pencil possibly hope to survive in the brave new world? I now order my favorite brand&mdash;the Paper Mate Mirado Black Warrior No. 2&mdash;by the case. I am reasonably confident I now have enough pencils on hand to see me through the next several novels&mdash;though, if I happen to misplace a pencil, I will search the house thoroughly before removing a new one from its special drawer and sharpening it for the first time. To sharpen a virgin pencil is, in a sense, to commit an act of assisted suicide. It saddens me.I wish it were not so. I wish I could write on a computer while traveling on an airplane or sitting in a strange hotel room, but I cannot. I have become a prisoner of my office. I need my floor, and my Mirado Black Warrior No. 2 pencils, and my McVitie&rsquo;s digestive biscuits. I hoard them, too. I keep them on a special shelf in the storage room, next to my socks from Marks &amp; Spencer.Copyright &copy; Daniel Silva 2011. All Rights Reserved.",

Itched to be a fly on your agent's office wall as she ignored your calls? Here's voyeurism at its playful, charming finest in Keyes's latest (afterSushi for Beginners;Under the Duvet; etc.). Gemma Hogan is living a lovely carefree life in Dublin when her father walks out on her mother, and she is summoned to play mom to her mom. But the magic of e-mail allows her to vent her woes to a friend in Seattle, who finds them hilarious enough to send to a top London agent, JoJo Harvey. JoJo, who is half Jessica Rabbit and half corporate powerhouse, likes Gemma's work but has bigger fish to fry-she is having a tormented affair with her married boss; her slimy co-worker is trying to beat her out for a coveted partner position; and her famed client Lily Wright, who wrote a gorgeous little cheerful fable that sold hundreds of thousands of copies, can't seem to get it together to write another book. Lily, in turn, is struggling with young motherhood, catastrophic finances and the paralyzing guilt of stealing her now-husband Anton from her former best friend, one Gemma Hogan. Keyes skillfully ties her interlocking plots together with grace and humor, and explores three disparate but gloriously real women's lives. It's a credit to Keyes that although she never exactly breaks new ground, she always serves up funny, heartwarming, believable fiction.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0060809779": "Bigger Thomas is doomed, trapped in a downward spiral that will lead to arrest, prison, or death, driven by despair, frustration, poverty, and incomprehension. As a young black man in the Chicago of the '30s, he has no way out of the walls of poverty and racism that surround him, and after he murders a young white woman in a moment of panic, these walls begin to close in. There is no help for him--not from his hapless family; not from liberal do-gooders or from his well-meaning yet naive friend Jan; certainly not from the police, prosecutors, or judges. Bigger is debased, aggressive, dangerous, and a violent criminal. As such, he has no claim upon our compassion or sympathy. And yet...A more compelling story thanNative Sonhas not been written in the 20th century by an American writer. That is not to say that Richard Wright created a novel free of flaws, but that he wrote the first novel that successfully told the most painful and unvarnished truth about American social and class relations. AsIrving Howeasserted in 1963, \"The dayNative Sonappeared, American culture was changed forever. It made impossible a repetition of the old lies [and] brought out into the open, as no one ever had before, the hatred, fear and violence that have crippled and may yet destroy our culture.\"Other books had focused on the experience of growing up black in America--including Wright's own highly successfulUncle Tom's Children, a collection of five stories that focused on the victimization of blacks who transgressed the code of racial segregation. But they suffered from what he saw as a kind of lyrical idealism, setting up sympathetic black characters in oppressive situations and evoking the reader's pity. InNative Son, Wright was aiming at something more. In Bigger, he created a character so damaged by racism and poverty, with dreams so perverted, and with human sensibilities so eroded, that he has no claim on the reader's compassion:\"I didn't want to kill,\" Bigger shouted. \"But what I killed for, I am! It must've been pretty deep in me to make me kill! I must have felt it awful hard to murder.... What I killed for must've been good!\" Bigger's voice was full of frenzied anguish. \"It must have been good! When a man kills, it's for something... I didn't know I was really alive in this world until I felt things hard enough to kill for 'em. It's the truth...\"Wright's genius was that, in preventing us from feeling pity for Bigger, he forced us to confront the hopelessness, misery, and injustice of the society that gave birth to him.--Andrew Himes",

For those unfamiliar with the series, a mysterious corporation has secretly been performing ungodly biotech experiments in the sleepy little town of Raccoon City. When reports of gory attacks come in from nearby areas, two crack military squads are sent to investigate. Players take the role of either sharpshooter Chris Redfield or demolitions expert Jill Valentine to track down the source of the town's problems--specifically, something in a decaying mansion that's mutating animals into grotesque killers and turning humans into bloodthirsty zombies. Supplies and ammunition are scarce, so players have to know when to fight, when to run, and how to keep their wits about them. Players can't afford to waste their shots and expect their characters to survive.The story is being retrofitted with motion-captured animation, next-generation graphics, real-time lighting and shadow effects, new areas, and newly rendered in-game video segments to create an even more cinematic experience.

And while the game clearly takes full advantage of the graphics  power and speed of the N64, a few components that made the original so compelling  have been left out of this release.Still, Nintendo's expertise at sucking players into the game world is strongly evident, andMario Kart 64offers enough challenges to keep players (especially casual  gamers) entertained. Placing a familiar Nintendo personality behind the wheel of a  sputtering kart powered by a 50, 100, or 150-cc engine, the game lets players race  computerized opponents or up to four other players on a variety of well-designed tracks.  Because karts lack the power and speed of race cars, drivers must focus on collecting  power-ups and nonlethal weapons rather than negotiating hairpin turns on two wheels.  Grabbing and using on-track items is the heart of the game's fun: a strategically-placed  banana peel sends the unlucky victim into a spin, nailing an opponent with a turtle shell  launches their vehicle skyward, and a rocket provides a quick boost to near-breakneck  speeds, if only for a moment.The multiplayer mode provides enormously chaotic fun for up to four players--flip it on  at a party and watch the guests congregate around the screen.--Eric TwelkerPros:Well-designed tracksSimple controlsStrong multiplayer appealCons:Computerized opponents sometimes pull off questionable feats",

She'd come to terms with the fact that the home was obviously not your run-of-the-mill state facility, or she wouldn't have discovered her powers as a necromancer or found the witch, Tori; the warlock, Simon; and the werewolf, Derek, also in residence. Now the four of them and the ghost of the recently deceased telekinetic Liz, are trying to find the one adult who can help them. Things are complicated by Simon's diabetes, Derek's imminent transformation, and Tori, who, despite her magical powers, is best described by a different word, which rhymes with witch. Armstrong does an admirable job of walking the fine line between making things too easy for the group and putting unnecessary obstacles in their path.

Thomas, a brilliant, handsome warrior who combines physical strength and skill with the bow, survives the pillaging of his village to become an archer and then rescues a female counterpart known as the Blackbird after she's nearly raped by Sir Simon Jekyll during one of the troop's raids in France. The nobleman becomes Thomas's chief rival as Jekyll continues to pursue the Blackbird, and Thomas is finally cast out of his unit after failing to kill Jekyll in an ill-conceived assassination attempt. He recovers to join and couple with the Blackbird, making his way through France and parlaying his skills into a royal pardon even as his opportunistic partner leaves him for the libidinous Prince of Wales. The three members of Cornwell's romantic triangle eventually meet during a huge climactic battle at Cr&#x82;cy, where Thomas must face up to a demanding family legacy involving a quest for a special lance. Cornwell has been down this path many times before, and he's a consummate pro when it comes to plying the tried-and-true combination of heroic characters; a fast-moving, action-packed plot; and enough twists and turns to keep the narrative from lapsing into formula. He uses his historical expertise judiciously as well. This book mark the beginning of a promising new series that brings an intriguing period to life.

Your missions include the D-day assault on Omaha Beach, tracking your Nazi nemesis aboard a speeding armored train, the epic battle for control of the Nijmegen Bridge, a strategic choke point in the Allied drive into the heart of Nazi Germany, and a top-secret, high-risk mission to steal the Ho IX flying wing. The Ho IX is an experimental Nazi jetfighter so powerful it could turn the tide of World War II.There are 20 levels of gameplay spread across six major missions, all based on real World War II events and all adding up to one complete and uninterrupted story line. Fully realized and highly-detailed 3-D environments include six times the number of nonplayer character animations as in the originalMedal of Honor.

        "0091795273": "An exhaustive, soul-searching memoir, Bill Clinton'sMy Lifeis a refreshingly candid look at the former president as a son, brother, teacher, father, husband, and public figure. Clinton painstakingly outlines the history behind his greatest successes and failures, including his dedication to educational and economic reform, his war against a \"vast right-wing operation\" determined to destroy him, and the \"morally indefensible\" acts for which he was nearly impeached.My Lifeis autobiography as therapy--a personal history written by a man trying to face and banish his private demons.Clinton approaches the story of his youth with gusto, sharing tales of giant watermelons, nine-pound tumors, a charging ram, famous mobsters and jazz musicians, and a BB gun standoff. He offers an equally energetic portrait of American history, pop culture, and the evolving political landscape, covering the historical events that shaped his early years (namely the deaths of Martin Luther King Jr. and JFK) and the events that shaped his presidency (Waco, Bosnia, Somalia). What makesMy Liferemarkable as a political memoir is how thoroughly it is infused with Clinton's unassuming, charmingly pithy voice:I learned a lot from the stories my uncle, aunts, and grandparents told me: that no one is perfect but most people are good; that people can't be judged only by their worst or weakest moments; that harsh judgments can make hypocrites of us all; that a lot of life is just showing up and hanging on; that laughter is often the best, and sometimes the only, response to pain.However, that same voice might tire readers as Clinton applies his penchant for minute details to a distractible laundry list of events, from his youth through the years of his presidency. Not wanting to forget a single detail that might help account for his actions, Clinton overdoes it--do we really need to know the name of his childhood barber? But when Clinton sticks to the meat of his story--recollections about Mother, his abusive stepfather, Hillary, the campaign trail, and Kenneth Starr--the veracity of emotion andKitchen Confidential-type revelations about \"what it is like to be President\" makeMy Lifeimpossible to put down.To Clinton, \"politics is a contact sport,\" and while he claims thatMy Lifeis not intended to make excuses or assign blame, it does portray him as a fighter whose strategy is to \"take the first hit, then counterpunch as hard as I could.\" WhileMy Lifeis primarily a stroll through Clinton's memories, it is also a scathing rebuke--a retaliation against his detractors, including Kenneth Starr, whose \"mindless search for scandal\" protected the guilty while \"persecuting the innocent\" and distracted his Administration from pressing international matters (including strikes on al Qaeda). Counterpunch indeed.At its core,My Lifeis a charming and intriguing if flawed book by an equally intriguing and flawed man who had his worst failures and humiliations made public. Ultimately, the man who left office in the shadow of scandal offers an honest and open account of his life, allowing readers to witness his struggle to \"drain the most out of every moment\" while maintaining the character with which he was raised. It is a remarkably intimate, persuasive look at the boy he was, the President he became, and man he is today.--Daphne Durham--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

Dennis, who quickly learned how to trade after starting as a runner at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in 1966 at age 17, had made a reported $200 million by 1983. To settle an argument with fellow trader William Eckhardt about whether trading ability was innate or could be taught, he put an ad in theWall Street Journaloffering to teach candidates how to trade in two weeks, and then backed them with his own money. Of the thousands of people who who applied, 23 turtles were accepted. Their trading made $100 million for Dennis, leading some to become highly successful traders in their own right. Having tracked down most of the people involved, Covel describes the turtle training, including rules for entering and exiting trades as well as Dennis and Eckhardt's personal lessons, and speculates on why some turtles succeeded more than others. However, there are too many characters with competing interests, and many missing facts. Covel's own strong views can also get more emphasis than the voices of the principals.

This faculty dean sacked the deadwood, made lots of hot new hires, including Yale-spawned literary-theory wunderkind Delphine Roux, and pissed off so many people for so many decades that now, in 1998, they've all turned on him. Silk's character assassination is partly owing to what the novel's narrator, Nathan Zuckerman, calls \"the Devil of the Little Place--the gossip, the jealousy, the acrimony, the boredom, the lies.\"But shocking, intensely dramatized events precipitate Silk's crisis. He remarks of two students who never showed up for class, \"Do they exist or are they spooks?\" They turn out to be black, and lodge a bogus charge of racism exploited by his enemies. Then, at 71, Viagra catapults Silk into \"the perpetual state of emergency that is sexual intoxication,\" and he ignites an affair with an illiterate janitor, Faunia Farley, 34. She's got a sharp sensibility, \"the laugh of a barmaid who keeps a baseball bat at her feet in case of trouble,\" and a melancholy voluptuousness. \"I'm back in the tornado,\" Silk exults. His campus persecutors burn him for it--and his main betrayer is Delphine Roux.In a short space, it's tough to convey the gale-force quality of Silk's rants, or the odd effect of Zuckerman's narration, alternately retrospective and torrentially in the moment. The flashbacks to Silk's youth in New Jersey are just as important as his turbulent forced retirement, because it turns out that for his entire adult life, Silk has been covering up the fact that he is a black man. (If this seems implausible, consider that the famousNew York Timesbook critic Anatole Broyard did the same thing.) Young Silk rejects both the racism that bars him from Woolworth's counter and the Negro solidarity of Howard University. \"Neither the they of Woolworth's nor the we of Howard\" is for Coleman Silk. \"Instead the raw I with all its agility.Self-discovery--thatwas the punch to the labonz....

Faunia, brutally abused by her Vietnam vet husband (a sketchy guy who seems to have wandered in from a lesser Russell Banks novel), scarred by the death of her kids, is one of Roth's best female characters ever. The self-serving Delphine Roux is intriguingly (and convincingly) nutty, and any number of minor characters pop in, mouth off, kick ass, and vanish, leaving a vivid sense of human passion and perversity behind.

En route to a beach vacation shortly after they meet, the couple takes a detour to the small town where Jeffrey grew up and began his law enforcement career. But their carefree holiday is interrupted when his best friend from childhood, a fellow cop, is charged with murder after killing a man who broke into his house. Despite his subsequent confession, Jeffrey believes there&#x92;s more to the story than Robert is telling him, and when the skeleton of a young woman with whom both Robert and Tolliver were once involved is discovered in a secret cave only they knew about, and Robert admits to her murder too, Tolliver must again confront a past he thought he had long since put behind him.Slaughter unravels a convoluted story deftly and smoothly as the action moves between those long-ago events and the siege of the police station by two young men who are determined to make Jeffrey pay for a crime they believe he committed. Threatening to kill whoever stands between them and their target--including eight children on a school field trip at the station house when the bloody siege begins--they execute a deputy they mistakenly believe is Tolliver. Skillfully blending past and present events and illuminating the equally convoluted relationship between Sara and Jeffrey (who have married and divorced in the intervening years) without interrupting the breathtaking pace of the action or dropping a beat, Slaughter takes this series to a new level of excellence.--Jane Adams",

That many (if not most) fantasy works are in some way derivative of Tolkien is understood, but the influence of the Lord of the Rings is so universal that everybody from George Lucas to Led Zeppelin has appropriated it for one purpose or another.Not just revolutionary because it was groundbreaking, the Lord of the Rings is timeless because it's the product of a truly top-shelf mind. Tolkien was a distinguished linguist and Oxford scholar of dead languages, with strong ideas about the importance of myth and story and a deep appreciation of nature. His epic, 10 years in the making, recounts the Great War of the Ring and the closing of Middle-Earth's Third Age, a time when magic begins to fade from the world and men rise to dominance. Tolkien carefully details this transition with tremendous skill and love, creating in the Lord of the Rings a universal and all-embracing tale, a justly celebrated classic.--Paul Hughes--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

Nintendo's Wave Bird isn't the first wireless controller ever brought  to market, but it's a whole lot better than what came before. You may remember a  brief fad a few years ago with spotty infrared devices. These units failed  because they were a lot heavier than standard controllers, and also because they  required a direct line of sight between the controller and the infrared  receiver. The Wave Bird is much lighter (it weighs a bit more than a regular  controller) and uses radio frequency signals for reliable game control at  distances of up to 20 feet. Unless your playing on a stadium-size TV screen,  that should be more than enough. The unit will last for about 100 hours of use  on just two AA batteries and has 16 channel frequencies, so you'll easily be  able to hook up four controllers without interference.",

        "0064401324": "Grade 3-6-Two delightful short books by John Reynolds Gardiner have been paired up in this audio set. Stone Fox (HarperCollins, 1980) tells the story of a boy determined to win a dog sled race to save his grandfather's farm. No one has ever beaten Stone Fox, an imposing and silent Native American, but little Willy trains daily for the race with his beloved dog, Searchlight. It seems like Willy might even win the race until heartbreaking tragedy strikes. Top Secret (Little, 1984) also features a determined boy and his grandfather, but in a much different setting and story. Allen Brewster has a fantastic idea that might even win the silver trophy at the science fair human photosynthesis. He has several obstacles to overcome. Allen persists in his mission using the scientific method and finally comes up with a concoction that turns him into a human plant. He turns green, craves sunlight and water instead of food, and sprouts baby roots if he stands in mud too long. Everything changes when Allen is deemed a threat to national security and his project is suddenly top secret. Both books are about 20 years old, so the characters do not represent very diverse backgrounds, but the messages of loyalty and determination are timeless. Tony Award winner B. D. Wong narrates the characters to fit the emotion and suspense of each story. The fact that one sentence was left out of the narration of Stone Fox and a few words were dropped from Top Secret might deter purchase of this audiobook for a read-along program. Each story could be listened to for pleasure or as a springboard for classroom discussion.Teresa Wittmann, St. Anthony School, Renton, WACopyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

Humanity has filled the galaxy, and thanks to ultra-high technology everyone has everything they want, no one gets sick, and no one dies. It's a playground society of sports, stellar cruises, parties, and festivals. Jernau Gurgeh, a famed master game player, is looking for something more and finds it when he's invited to a game tournament at a small alien empire. Abruptly Banks veers into different territory. The Empire of Azad is exotic, sensual, and vibrant. It has space battle cruisers, a glowing court--all the stuff of good old science fiction--which appears old-fashioned in contrast to Gurgeh's home. At first it's a relief, but further exploration reveals the empire to be depraved and terrifically unjust. Its defects are gross exaggerations of our own, yet they indict us all the same. Clearly Banks is interested in the idea of a future where everyone can be mature and happy. Yet it's interesting to note that in order to give us this compelling adventure story, he has to return to a more traditional setting. Thoughtful science fiction readers will appreciate the cultural comparisons, and fans of big ideas and action will also be rewarded.--Brooks Peck",

        "B000067DPM": "Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship",

All is well until WWII erupts and an army outpost is installed nearby. Soldiers lure Helen to dances, seduce Bea into a hasty romance, and rob Helen&#x2019;s sister Jane of her innocence.  Then word comes that her brother has been killed in action, and the world can no longer be held at bay. When Helen returns decades later as a young wife and mother, she tries to re-create Ashaunt&#x2019;s former simplicity for her emotionally fragile son, but the Vietnam war and the counterculture take their toll. At the end of her life, as cancer ravages her body, Helen finds Ashaunt equally threatened by environmental disasters and encroaching development, and the outrage becomes too much to bear.

Yet salt, Kurlansky asserts, has \"shaped civilization.\" Although now taken for granted, these square crystals are not only of practical use, but over the ages have symbolized fertility (it is, after all, the root of the word \"salacious\") and lasting covenants, and have been used in magical charms. Called a \"divine substance\" by Homer, salt is an essential part of the human body, was one of the first international commodities and was often used as currency throughout the developing world. Kurlansky traces the history of salt's influences from prehistoric China and ancient Africa (in Egypt they made mummies using salt) to Europe (in 12th-century Provence, France, salt merchants built \"a system of solar evaporation ponds\") and the Americas, through chapters with intriguing titles like \"A Discourse on Salt, Cadavers and Pungent Sauces.\" The book is populated with characters as diverse as frozen-food giant Clarence Birdseye; Gandhi, who broke the British salt law that forbade salt production in India because it outdid the British salt trade; and New York City's sturgeon king, Barney Greengrass.

        "0075536668": "The ostensible subject ofThe Sound and the Furyis the  dissolution of the  Compsons, one of those august old Mississippi families that fell on hard  times and wild eccentricity after the Civil War. But in fact what William Faulkner  is really after in his legendary novel is the kaleidoscope of consciousness--the overwrought mind caught in the act of thought. His rich, dark, scandal-ridden story of  squandered fortune, incest (in thought if not in deed), madness, congenital brain damage, theft, illegitimacy, and stoic endurance is told in the interior  voices of three Compson brothers: first Benjy, the \"idiot\" man-child who  blurs together three decades of inchoate sensations as he stalks the fringes  of the family's former pasture; next Quentin, torturing himself brilliantly, obsessively over Caddy's lost virginity and his own failure to recover the family's honor as he wanders around the seedy fringes of Boston; and finally Jason, heartless, shrewd, sneaking, nursing a perpetual sense of injury and outrage against his outrageous family.If Benjy's section is the most daringly experimental, Jason's is the most  harrowing. \"Once a bitch always a bitch, what I say,\" he begins, lacing into Caddy's illegitimate daughter, and then proceeds to hurl mud at blacks, Jews, his sacred Compson ancestors, his glamorous, promiscuous sister, his  doomed  brother Quentin, his ailing mother, and the long-suffering black servant Dilsey who holds the family together by sheer force of character.Notoriously \"difficult,\"The Sound and the Furyis actually one of  Faulkner's more accessible works once you get past the abrupt, unannounced  time shifts--and certainly the most powerful emotionally. Everything is  here: the complex equilibrium of pre-civil rights race relations; the  conflict between Yankee capitalism and Southern agrarian values; a meditation  on time, consciousness, and Western philosophy. And all of it is rendered in prose  so gorgeous it can take your breath away. Here, for instance, Quentin recalls an  autumnal encounter back home with the old black possum hunter Uncle Louis:And we'd sit in the dry leaves that whispered a little with the slow  respiration of our waiting and with the slow breathing of the earth and the windless October, the rank smell of the lantern fouling the brittle air,  listening to the dogs and to the echo of Louis' voice dying away.  He never raised it, yet on a still night we have heard it from our front porch.  When  he called the dogs in he sounded just like the horn he carried slung on his shoulder and never used, but clearer, mellower, as though his voice were a  part of darkness and silence, coiling out of it, coiling into it again.   WhoOoooo.  WhoOoooo.  WhoOooooooooooooooo.What Faulkner has created is a modernist epic in which characters assume  the stature of gods and the primal family events resonate like myths.

It's already here, living in the head of the guy who just crossed the street in front of you, or maybe even closer than that. We saw these possibilities get played out in the author's bloodsporting-anarchist-yuppie shocker of a first novel,Fight Club.  Now, inSurvivor, his second and newest, the concern is more for the origin of the malaise. Starting at chapter 47 and screaming toward ground zero, Palahniuk hurls the reader back to the beginning in a breathless search for where it all went wrong. This time out, the author's protagonist is self-made, self-ruined mogul-messiah Tender Branson, the sole passenger of a jet moments away from slamming first into the Australian outback and then into oblivion. All that will be left, Branson assures us with a tone bordering on relief, is his life story, from its Amish-on-acid cult beginnings to its televangelist-huckster end. All of this courtesy of the plane's flight recorder.Speaking of little black boxes, Skinnerians would have a field day with the presenting behavior of the folks who make up Palahniuk's world. They pretend they're suicide hotline operators for fun. They eat lobster before it's quite... done. They dance in morgues. The Cleavers they are not. Scary as they might be, these characters are ultimately more scared of themselves than you are, and that's what makes them so fascinating. In the wee hours and on lonely highways, they exist in a perpetual twilight, caught between the horror of the present and the dread of the unknown.

With nothing to gain, any who could soon abandoned Pandora, leaving those who remained to deal with the lawlessness of a world gone bust, and the mystery of the long-dead alien civilization. But as chaotic as these times were, there were worse days yet to come. After several years the planet's huge orbit slowly brought it near to its sun and once unknown and horrifying creatures sprang from their long hibernation to terrify the stranded colonists. The only hope of the colonists seems to be a vault discovered in the side of a mountainside, rumored to contain alien technology and secrets about Pandora. Will this discovery be the colonist's salvation or their end?

        "006174266X": "Gr 5-8-Donovan Curtis is an impulse-driven prankster who, at the start of Ungifted, manages to alienate both the students and faculty of his middle school. First he mocks the basketball team over the school PA system with a derisive cheer and then he whacks the school's statue of Atlas with a stick, knocking the huge globe off and sending it rolling down the hill where it smashes into the gymnasium and stops the big game. When Donovan ends up on the carpet, the district superintendent accidentally adds his name to the roll of gifted students at the Academy for Scholastic Distinction. Although he flounders at his new school, Donovan ends up humanizing a program that focuses on academic achievement and ignores the social aspects of students' success. From his first day when he startles the robotics team by naming their robot, to his saving the class from summer school by drafting his pregnant sister as the answer to a missed credit in Human Development, Donovan finds that his gift lies in helping the smart kids by teaching them how to be \"normal.\" Using an ancestor who survived the Titanic as inspiration, Donovan has a goofy kindness that charms characters and readers alike. Reminiscent of Stanley Yelnats and Joey Pigza, he careens through life much like the out-of-control globe from Atlas's statue. The story is told from the points of view of various characters (each chapter titled with an Un-word), and readers hear from teachers and administrators, students-both gifted and not-and family members. The message is tolerance, and Korman expertly and humorously delivers it in an unpretentious and universally appealing tale.-Jane Barrer, Steinway Intermediate School, New York City&#x3B1;(c) Copyright 2011.

He finds himself on the run with a small group of his peers, battling other supernatural beings in a race to find a powerful artifact and avert disaster. Hmm, sounds familiar. This is not The Lightning Thief (Hyperion, 2005) and the mythology is the lost city of Atlantis rather than the Greek pantheon, but comparisons with the \"Percy Jackson\" series are inevitable. Unfortunately, this volume hardly measures up. Jack McKinley is just not as likable or believable as Rick Riordan's protagonist, and the supporting characters are flat. There are far too many deus ex machina moments needed to move the story along (e.g., Marco falling to his death but landing just close enough to a magic waterfall to not actually die). There is plenty of action throughout, and some of it is quite original (nearly dying under a mountain of flaming bat guano is certainly \"fresh\"), but it is not enough to make up for the uneven plot and weak characters.-Anthony C.

Easily one of the best games of its  genre on any video game console, this long-awaited follow-up toGoldenEye 007is a must-have for Nintendo 64 owners--and a damn  good reason to be one if you're not.The futuristicPerfect Darkcasts players as Joanna Dark, a  secret agent who becomes embroiled in a sinister conspiracy involving  aliens and an evil corporation. Gameplay is broken down into missions,  each with objectives that must be unerringly completed before  progressing to the next mission. This is not your typical kill-anything-that-moves  game: putting a bullet in the wrong person, not keeping the  right one alive, or perforating a seemingly unimportant inanimate object  can often result in mission failure.WhilePerfect Dark's solo missions play out much like those inGoldenEye 007, the game's fantastic multiplayer options are  another matter entirely. Cooperative and counteroperative simultaneous-play  modes allow for another player to join in on a mission as,  respectively, a teammate or the enemy. However, the real fun here is in  the highly customizable Combat Simulator, a one-to-four-player  simultaneous-play mode that features both free-for-alls and team-based  challenges and can include up to eight Simulants, computer-controlled  combatants of varying behavior.Although Simulants make for decent adversaries or teammates, you'll want  to grab a friend--and an Expansion Pak, as only 35 percent of the game  is available without one--to fully enjoyPerfect Dark.--Joe  HonPros:One of the best first-person shooters on any video game consoleOutstanding multiplayer game with huge replay valueBevy of game options, cheats, and secret featuresExcellent training mode with challenges all of its ownCons:Graphics get ugly when playing with more than two players",

        "0062024027": "A Q&amp;A with Author Veronica RothQ:What advice would you offer to young aspiring writers, who long to live a success story like your own?Roth:One piece of advice I have is: Want something else more than success. Success is a lovely thing, but your desire to say something, your worth, and your identity shouldn&rsquo;t rely on it, because it&rsquo;s not guaranteed and it&rsquo;s not permanent and it&rsquo;s not sufficient. So work hard, fall in love with the writing&mdash;the characters, the story, the words, the themes&mdash;and make sure that you are who you are regardless of your life circumstances. That way, when the good things come, they don&rsquo;t warp you, and when the bad things hit you, you don&rsquo;t fall apart.Q:You&rsquo;re a young author--is it your current adult perspective or not-so-recent teenage perspective that brought about the factions in the development of this story? Do you think that teens or adults are more likely to fit into categories in our current society?Roth:Other aspects of my identity have more to do with the factions than my age. The faction system reflects my beliefs about human nature&mdash;that we can make even something as well-intentioned as virtue into an idol, or an evil thing. And that virtue as an end unto itself is worthless to us. I did spend a large portion of my adolescence trying to be as &ldquo;good&rdquo; as possible so that I could prove my worth to the people around me, to myself, to God, to everyone. It&rsquo;s only now that I&rsquo;m a little older that I realize I am unable to be truly &ldquo;good&rdquo; and that it&rsquo;s my reasons for striving after virtue that need adjustment more than my behavior. In a sense,Divergentis me writing through that realization&mdash;everyone in Beatrice&rsquo;s society believes that virtue is the end, the answer. I think that&rsquo;s a little twisted.I think we all secretly love and hate categories&mdash;love to get a firm hold on our identities, but hate to be confined&mdash;and I never loved and hated them more than when I was a teenager. That said: Though we hear a lot about high school cliques, I believe that adults categorize each other just as often, just in subtler ways. It is a dangerous tendency of ours. And it begins in adolescence.Q:If you could add one more faction to the world withinDivergent, what would it be?Roth:I tried to construct the factions so that they spanned a wide range of virtues. Abnegation, for example, includes five of the traditional &ldquo;seven heavenly virtues:&rdquo; chastity, temperance, charity, patience, and humility. That said, it would be interesting to have a faction centered on industriousness, in which diligence and hard work are valued most, and laziness is not allowed. They would be in constant motion, and would probably be happy to take over for the factionless. And hard-working people can certainly take their work too far, as all the factions do with their respective virtues. I&rsquo;m not sure what they would wear, though. Overalls, probably.Q:What do you think are the advantages, if any, to the society you&rsquo;ve created inDivergent?Roth:All the advantages I see only seem like advantages to me because I live in our current society. For example, the members of their society don&rsquo;t focus on certain things: race, religion, sexual orientation, political affiliation, etc. I mean, a world in which you look different from the majority and no one minds? That sounds good to me. But when I think about it more, I realize that they&rsquo;re doing the exact same thing we do, but with different criteria by which to distinguish ourselves from others. Instead of your skin color, it&rsquo;s the color of your shirt that people assess, or the results of your aptitude test. Same problem, different system.Q:What book are you currently reading and how has it changed you, if at all?Roth:I recently finishedImaginary Girlsby Nova Ren Suma, which I would call &ldquo;contemporary with a paranormal twist,&rdquo; or something to that effect. It&rsquo;s about a girl whose sister has a powerful kind of magnetism within the confines of a particular town, and how their love for each other breaks some things apart and puts other things back together. It was refreshing to read a young adult book that is about sisterhood instead of romance. It&rsquo;s one of those books that makes you love a character and then hate a character and then love them again&mdash;that shows you that people aren&rsquo;t all good or all bad, but somewhere in between.Imaginary Girlsgave me a lot to think about, and the writing was lovely, which I always love to see.",

The story opens in 1899 with the funeral of Elizabeth Holland, a well-bred beauty said to have plunged to her death in the Hudson River. The narrative then travels back several weeks, tracing the relationships and events that have led to the somber assembly. This tangled web includes not one but two sets of star-crossed lovers; an upstairs/downstairs romance; a scheming social climber; a bitter servant girl; and oodles of money, all set in a Edith Wharton via Hollywood vision of Old New York.

        "0061340634": "SignatureReviewed byAndrew O'HaganNovelists can no longer take it as an insult when people say their novels are like good television, because the finest American television is better written than most novels. Ann Patchett's new one has the texture, the pace and the fairy tale elegance of a half dozen novels she might have read and loved growing up, but the magic and the finesse ofRunis really much closer to that ofSix Feet UnderorERorThe Sopranos, and that is good news for everybody, not least her readers.Bernadette and Bernard Doyle were a Boston couple who wanted to have a big lively family. They had one boy, Sullivan, and then adopted two black kids, Teddy and Tip. Mr. Doyle is a former mayor of Boston and he continues his interest in politics, hoping his boys will shape up one day for elected office, though none of them seems especially keen. Bernadette dies when the adopted kids are just four, and much of the book offers a placid requiem to her memory in particular and to the force of motherhood in lives generally. An old statue from Bernadette's side of the family seems to convey miracles, and there will be more than one before this gracious book is done. One night, during a heavy snowfall, Teddy and Tip accompany their father to a lecture given by Jessie Jackson at the Kennedy Centre. Tip is preoccupied with studying fish, so he feels more than a little coerced by his father. After the lecture they get into an argument and Tip walks backwards in the road. A car appears out of nowhere and so does a woman called Tennessee, who pushes Tip out of the car's path and is herself struck. Thus, a woman is taken to hospital and her daughter, Kenya, is left in the company of the Doyles. Relationships begin both to emerge and unravel, disclosing secrets, hopes, fears.Runis a novel with timeless concerns at its heart&mdash;class and belonging, parenthood and love&mdash;and if it wears that heart on its sleeve, then it does so with confidence. And so it should: the book is lovely to read and is satisfyingly bold in its attempt to say something patient and true about family. Patchett knows how to wear big human concerns very lightly, and that is a continuing bonus for those who found a great deal to admire in her previous work, especially the ultra-laudedBel Canto. Yet one should not mistake that lightness for anything cosmetic:Runis a book that sets out inventively to contend with the temper of our times, and by the end we feel we really know the Doyle family in all its intensity and with all its surprises.Andrew O'Hagan's novel Be Near Mehas just been published by Harcourt.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But looks aren't everything; his quality, an admirer once wrote,  \"was mostly in his heart.\" Laura Hillenbrand tells the story of the horse who  became a cultural icon inSeabiscuit: An American Legend.Seabiscuit rose to prominence with the help of an unlikely triumvirate: owner  Charles Howard, an automobile baron who once declared that \"the day of the horse  is past\"; trainer Tom Smith, a man who \"had cultivated an almost mystical  communication with horses\"; and jockey Red Pollard, who was down on his luck  when he charmed a then-surly horse with his calm demeanor and a sugar cube.  Hillenbrand details the ups and downs of \"team Seabiscuit,\" from early training  sessions to record-breaking victories, and from serious injury to \"Horse of the  Year\"--as well as the Biscuit's fabled rivalry with War Admiral. She also  describes the world of horseracing in the 1930s, from the snobbery of Eastern  journalists regarding Western horses and public fascination with the great  thoroughbreds to the jockeys' torturous weight-loss regimens, including saunas  in rubber suits, strong purgatives, even tapeworms.Along the way, Hillenbrand paints wonderful images: tears in Tom Smith's eyes as  his hero, legendary trainer James Fitzsimmons, asked to hold Seabiscuit's bridle  while the horse was saddled; critically injured Red Pollard, whose  chest was crushed in a racing accident a few weeks before, listening to the San  Antonio Handicap from his hospital bed, cheering \"Get going, Biscuit! Get 'em,  you old devil!\"; Seabiscuit happily posing for photographers for several minutes  on end; other horses refusing to work out with Seabiscuit because he teased and  taunted them with his blistering speed.Though sometimes her prose takes on a distinctly purple hue (\"His history had  the ethereal quality of hoofprints in windblown snow\"; \"The California sunlight  had the pewter cast of a declining season\"), Hillenbrand has crafted a  delightful book. Wire to wire,Seabiscuitis a winner. Highly  recommended.--Sunny Delaney--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

        "0061438596": "While the Bible may be the word of God, transcribed by divinely inspired men, it does not provide a full (or even partial) account of the life of Jesus Christ. Lucky for us that Christopher Moore presents a funny, lighthearted satire of the life of Christ--from his childhood days up to his crucifixion--inLamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal. This clever novel is surely blasphemy to some, but to others it's a coming-of-age story of the highest order.Joshua (a.k.a. Jesus) knows he is unique and quite alone in his calling, but what exactly does his Father want of him? Taking liberties with ancient history, Moore works up an adventure tale as Biff and Joshua seek out the three wise men so that Joshua can better understand what he is supposed to do as Messiah. Biff, a capable sinner, tags along and gives Joshua ample opportunities to know the failings and weaknesses of being truly human. With a wit similar to Douglas Adams, Moore pulls no punches: a young Biff has the hots for Joshua's mom, Mary, which doesn't amuse Josh much: \"Don't let anyone ever tell you that the Prince of Peace never struck anyone.\" And the origin of the Easter Bunny is explained as a drunken Jesus gushes his affection for bunnies, declaring, \"Henceforth and from now on, I decree that whenever something bad happens to me, there shall be bunnies around.\"One small problem with the narrative is that Biff and Joshua often do not have distinct voices. A larger difficulty is that as the tone becomes more somber with Joshua's life drawing to its inevitable close, the one-liners, though not as numerous, seem forced. True to form,Lambkeeps the story of Joshua light, even after its darkest moments.--Michael Ferch--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

        "0060959584": "Hopefully, years from now,Eating Well for Optimum Healthwill be looked upon as the book that saved the health of millions of Americans and transformed the way we eat--not as the book we overlooked at our own peril. It clarifies the mishmash of conflicting news, research, hype, and hearsay regarding diet, nutrition, and supplementation, and further establishes the judicious Dr. Weil, the director of the Program in Integrative Medicine at the University of Arizona, as a savior of public well-being. If you've ever wondered what \"partially hydrogenated soybean oil\" really is, been perplexed by contrary news reports about recommended dosages for supplements, or questioned the safety of using aluminum pots for cooking, Dr. Weil will make it all clear.Weil (pronounced \"while\") bravely criticizes many of the major diet books on the market, and backs up his admonitions with science. He warns readers to not fall under \"the spell\" of the anticarbohydrate Atkins Diet, but also criticizes the eating plan advocated by Dr. Dean Ornish--which has been granted Medicare coverage for cardiac patients--as being too low fat for the majority of people. (The omega-3 fatty acids missing from Ornish's diet are essential for hormone production and the control of inflammation, he says.) It's also fascinating to learn that autism, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease may be caused by omega-3 fatty acid deficiencies, while an excess of omega-6 fatty acids--very common in the typical American diet--can exacerbate arthritis symptoms. Weil's explanation of the chemistry of fats will prove difficult for most readers, but few will want to eat fast-food French fries ever again after reading his appalling reasons for avoiding them, which go way beyond their well-documented heart-clogging capabilities.After a thorough rundown of nutritional basics and a primer of micronutrients such as vitamins, minerals, fiber, and phytochemicals, Weil unveils what he feels is \"the best diet in the world,\" with 85 recipes, such as Salmon Cakes and Oven-Fried Potatoes, that are healthy, tasty, quick to prepare, and complete with nutritional breakdowns. He includes a stirring chapter on safe weight loss (he sympathizes with the overweight and comically recalls his one-week trial of a safflower oil-diet while an undergraduate). Other, equally enlightening sections include tips for eating out and shopping for food (with warnings on various additives and a guide to organics), and a wondrous appendix with dietary recommendations for dozens of health concerns, including allergies, asthma, cancer prevention, mood disorders, and pregnancy.Eating Wellis an indispensable consumer reference and one not afraid to lambaste the diet industry and empower the public with information about which the majority of doctors--to the detriment of the public health--are ignorant.--Erica Jorgensen--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

In many ways it's a coming-of-age novel, as Tiffany is now on her own. Known as &#x201C;The Hag O'the Hills,&#x201D; she spends her time tending to the messy, menial, everyday things that no one else will take care of, such as fixing bones or easing the pain of a dying man. But as she tries to serve the people of the Chalk hills, she senses a growing distrust of her, and a loss of respect for witches in general. Along with the Nac Mac Feegles, she has to seek out the source of this growing fear. Tiffany discovers she may have been responsible for waking an evil force when she kissed the winter in Wintersmith (HarperTempest, 2006). The Cunning Man is in need of a host body and is searching for Tiffany. Pratchett combines gut-busting humor and amusing footnotes with a genuine poignancy as Tiffany tries to decide what her future should be. Fans of the author's &#x201C;Discworld&#x201D; (HarperCollins) books will enjoy the connections with the larger series, particularly the inclusion of Granny Weatherwax.

        "0061144835": "Outnumbered Saxon forces continue battling Danish invaders in this rousing sequel to the bestsellingThe Last Kingdom. It's A.D. 877, and the dispossessed Northumbrian noble Uhtred has just routed the Danes in a battle at Cynuit in southern England. Logically, Uhtred should now ally himself with Alfred, whose Wessex kingdom alone has successfully resisted Danish control. But Uhtred sees a better chance of recovering his lost estate if he finds a way to join the Danes, who raised him and whose simple life of \"ale, women, sword, and reputation\" he finds more congenial than Alfred's Christian piety and military caution. But when the Danes invade Wessex, Uhtred's loyalties are further divided. His Celtic mistress foretells victory for Alfred, but Uhtred can scarcely believe that the bedraggled king, camped in isolated marshes with a handful of supporters, can repel the invaders and unite England. Yet pride grows in Uhtred: \"I understood that among the Danes I was as important as my friends, and without friends I was just another landless, masterless warrior. But among the Saxons I was another Saxon, and among the Saxons I did not need another man's generosity.\" Uhtred demonstrates his newfound patriotism in the book's climactic battle at Edington. Filled with bawdy humor, bloodlust, treachery and valor, this stirring tale will leave readers eager for the next volume in this Alfred the Great series.(Jan.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Penniless and shipless, you venture around a space dock until you find a ship and a job. You'll encounter a heady mix of canned missions that follow one main quest, and a million opportunities to make money or aggravate the various factions that co-exist in the universe. Like an online role-playing game, or Bethesda'sMorrowind, you determine who your enemies are and who your friends are by your own actions, and, in another nod to role-playing, you can customize your ship with guns, rockets, and equipment just as you would customize a RPG character with swords, bows, and magic items. Best of all, you can play cooperatively with friends or fight it out with enemies online.The backstory posits a future where various countries, divided by both nationality and, seemingly, race, have boarded massive colony ships and ventured into a wormhole that appeared within reach of our crude space technology. They found themselves in a galaxy far, far away and they got stuck there when the wormhole collapsed. They quickly colonized new home worlds and named everything with familiar locales that make navigation a breeze. In the American sectors you'll feel at home entering the New York system and landing at a spaceport called Manhattan, for example. While contrived, this device is used beautifully and it's far better than having to memorize a bunch of sci-fi names and remembering where they are, perfect for a massive universe such as this one.ThoughFreelanceris set in space, it is technically not a space simulation. The game was designed to be accessible to casual gamers. For example,Freelancermakes you use the mouse for ship control. This is quite a shift for a game genre normally known to require joystick control. But even old-schoolWing CommanderorX-Wingfans may find that the sacrifice of verisimilitude is made up for with gains in agility. The mouse controls your guns, while you use the keyboard to maneuver around the rich universe that developer Digital Anvil has constructed. Much like a first-person shooter, you can dodge and weave while precisely blasting your enemies.Despite the game's age, its graphics are spectacular, as is the sound and voice acting, and in that way, fighting and trading with friends or alone,Freelancerproves worth the wait. Just keep in mind that it is explicitly not a hardcore space simulation, and you'll have to leave your joystick on the shelf.--Andrew S.

Completed in 1960 and then confiscated by the KGB, it remained unpublished at the author's death in 1964; it was smuggled into the West in 1980. Grossman offers a bitter, compelling vision of a totalitarian regime where the spirit of freedom that arose among those under fire was feared by the state at least as much as were the Nazis. His huge cast of characters includes an old Bolshevik now under arrest, a physicist pressured to make his scientific discoveries conform to \"socialist reality\" and a Jewish doctor en route to the gas chambers in occupied Russia. Ironically, just as Stalingrad is liberated from the Germans, many of the characters find themselves bound in new slavery to the Soviet government.

        "B000TVT8PI": "As DVD playback made the PlayStation 2 more than just a game machine, hefty multi-media features make the Sony PlayStation 3 an even more versatile home entertainment machine. Features such as video chat, internet access, digital photo viewing, and digital audio and video will likely make it the central component of your media set-up. Still, it is first and foremost a game console--a powerful one at that.Under the HoodThe PS3 features IBM's \"Cell\" processor and a co-developed Nvidia graphics processor that makes the system able to perform two trillion calculations per second. That's approximately 320 times more calculations per second than the PS2. Along with the traditional AV and composite connections, it also boasts an HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) port, which delivers uncompressed, unconverted digital picture and sound to compatible high-definition TV and projectors. The system is capable of 128-bit pixel precision and 1080p resolution for a full HD experience.PlayStation 3: Tower of PowerA sleek new lookFeatures a wireless motion-sensitive controllerBlu-Ray Is the New WaySony's PlayStation 3 games are encoded onto the Blu-Ray disc media format, which can hold six times as much data as traditional DVDs. This increase in capacity, combined with the awesome power of its processor and graphics card, promises mind-blowing games once developers have learned how to fully harness the new console's power. The PS3 will also support CD-ROM, CD-RW, DVD, DVD-ROM, DVD-R, DVD+R formats.In addition, PlayStation 3 system software update version 2.20 and up includesBD Live support. With this you can now play discs that support Blu-ray Disc Profile 2.0 (BD-LIVE) and you can also connect to the Internet while playing discs that support this format so that you can obtain additional features. Features that are available vary depending on the software in use.Sensational ControllerNew gamers intuitively move the controller while playing, even though that movement has traditionally had no relation to what's going on in the game. Sony has picked up on this tendency and is using it to bring a new level of control to the PS3. Inside the controller is a high-precision six-axis sensing system that accurately detects fine movements in pitch, roll, and yaw, as well as three dimensions of movement. This means that future PS3 games will be controlled by the movements of your hands rather than just your thumbs. For example, you might be able to steer a car by holding the controller like a steering wheel.While the PS3 controller looks much like its Dual Shock predecessors, it will lack the force-feedback vibration since that would only interfere with the sensing system. It uses Bluetooth 2.0 wireless technology and can support up to seven wireless controllers at a time. It's a hot-swappable system, so if your controller is running low on power, just pause your game and connect a USB 2.0 cable. You can continue playing while your controller recharges automatically.Backwards CompatibleThe PlayStation 3 will be backward compatible with most PlayStation and PlayStation 2 games, which means you'll be able to play your favorite games without keeping all the old systems. The console will have slots for Memory Stick Duo, an SD slot and a Compact Flash memory slot. It comes with a pre-installed hard disc drive, which allows you to save games as well as download content from the internet.Gran Turismo 5 PrologueResistance: Fall of ManA Slew of New GamesA whole host of game publishers are already backing the PS3 and several have even confirmed games for the console. At the 2006 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), more than 30 titles were displayed for the system, includingGran Turismo HD,Resistance: Fall of Man, andFinal Fantasy XIII. Previously announced titles includeMetal Gear Solid 4,Devil May Cry 4andTekken 6.OnlineSony has stated that the PS3 will have similar online connectivity and services as the next generation of Xbox Live. Calling it \"an always on, always connected device,\" SCEI's chief technical officer Masa Chatani said the PS3 would be constantly in touch with a \"PlayStation World\" network \"fundamentally based on community, communication commerce, and content.\" Technically, the infrastructure is there to make that connection.

        "0062023020": "This fantasy-romance debut features faerie king Rain Tairen Soul, a man tormented by age-old grief: a thousand years ago, the woman he loved was slain in battle, and in his rage he laid waste to half the world. Now his people are dying out and the evil mages of Eld are rising again. When Rain hears the call of his lost soul mate, Ellysetta, he journeys to the neighboring kingdom to find her; when he claims a woodcarver's daughter as his mate, he scandalizes the nobility of her country and rouses the interest of Eld's wicked wizards, who come seeking her in order to get at Rain. The first book in a series, much of this volume is devoted to establishing the characters and their world, at the expense of plot. Though the extended courtship between Rain and Ellysetta can grow tedious, the story moves well enough to hold readers' interest and draw them into the sequel (due in November), which should advance the plot significantly. A promising start, this series should have great appeal for fans of fantasy and will likely reward romance readers for whom patience is not a problem.(Oct.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0061013315": "As a member of the British House of Lords and as former member of Parliament, Jeffrey Archer knows some of the most powerful people in the world. Indeed, the acknowledgements of this closely plotted thriller include current and former members of the American CIA, FBI, NSA, Secret Service, and a former U.S. attorney general.  From this background, Archer weaves a tale that follows his hero, CIA assassin Connor Fitzgerald, while simultaneously shadowing his bosses in Washington.The opening chapters feature unrelenting action as Connor tracks and kills a Colombian presidential candidate and starts a chain of events that could lead to a new Cold War. But, despite his ruthless background, Connor is not a cold and hollow plot device. He's an American Medal of Honor winner who is committed to his country, but also to his spiritual home, Ireland.  Archer even pauses briefly to flesh out Connor's family life and the tensions of living with secrets that his wife and beloved daughter suspect but will never know.  This character work pays off as the reader follows Connor through several nations and nearly as many identities. Gradually, Connor is caught in Russia between two power brokers: CIA director Helen Dexter and President Tom Lawrence.  Dexter needs her 28-year veteran agent dead or &quot;disappeared&quot; in a Russian prison.  But President Lawrence also needs Connor so he can finally rid himself of Dexter's tacit control of U.S. foreign policy.In the end, Connor must rely on old friends and native intelligence if he is to make it to his retirement alive. Fans of political intrigue, James Bond, and Tom Clancy will be drawn inexorably along for the ride.--Patrick O'Kelley--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

I was the assistant to his editor at that time, Edite Kroll.  Was I lucky!Q:What was his creative process like and how did you two work together?Markiet:I remember most clearly that Shel was meticulous in every aspect of a book... the trim size, the paper, the binding and of course, the contents.  No piece of the whole was too small to consider carefully.  He looked at every spread to be sure art and text were positioned the best way possible.  And, he considered every word and expression until it, and the whole text, was just right.  I learned how a book is made in the best possible way.Q:Shel passed away in 1999 but more than ten years later you&rsquo;re publishingEvery Thing On It, which includes tons of his never-before-seen poems and drawings. Can you tell us how this project came to be?Markiet:Over the years, Shel continued to write and draw and work on poems.  He left a rich archive of finished material.

Floaters are not pulled from the St. Lawrence... and some of last season's dead are not found until the spring melt.\"Readers of Kathy Reichs's cool and clever first forensic thrillerD&eacute;j&agrave; Deadwill  recognize the ironic voice of Tempe (short for Temperance) Brennan, the North Carolina-born scientist who winds up working at the Laboratoire de M&eacute;dicine L&eacute;gale in Montreal. Here she bristles at the  conservative attitudes of some of her Canadian colleagues.Despite the cold weather, Tempe's workload quickly becomes heavy: the bones of a long-dead nun now up for sainthood have been moved and tampered with; a deadly house fire turns out to be arson; and a university teaching assistant disappears after joining a cult. Tempe must figure out where (and why) all the bodies are buried in the hard Canadian ground. Her investigations take her home to North Carolina, and to a strange colony living on an offshore island.Unlike certain other writers who specialize in forensic pathology,  Reichs doesn't revel in the horror of death or rub our noses in gore: she uses the science of death to reveal rather than to shock or startle.

You&rsquo;ll get a competitive advantage by hearing sound cues that youcan&rsquo;thear with speakers, such as the soft footsteps of an enemy sneaking up behind you, or the loading of a weapon far in the distance, regardless of the direction. By hearing sounds others can&rsquo;t - and by knowing where they&rsquo;re coming from - you&rsquo;ll react faster and take them out before they takeyouout.If you&rsquo;re serious about XBOX 360 gaming, get serious about the sound. Invest in an Ear Force X41 and experience the game the way it was meant to be heard. It will help you to become a better player and you&rsquo;ll have a lot more fun enjoying your XBOX 360.&nbsp;Dolby 7.1 Channel Surround Sound Technology!Click here to enlarge&nbsp;Take your gaming to the next level by experiencing how your Xbox 360 was meant to be heard!Click here to enlarge&nbsp;Enjoy late night gaming without disturbing others!Click here to enlarge&nbsp;&nbsp;Dolby 7.1 Channel Surround SoundThe Ear Force X41 transmitter uses a 150MPS Digital Signal Processor (DSP) to deliver genuine Dolby Digital sound, Dolby Pro Logic IIx, and Dolby Headphone surround sound processing technologies - the industry-standard formats for encoding multi-channel sound in XBOX 360 games and DVD movies. The X41 uses the latest version of Dolby technology to create realistic game sound in 7.1 channels for improved surround sound accuracy.Dolby Pro Logic IIx and Stereo EnhancerThe X41 transmitter incorporates the latest Dolby Pro Logic IIx decoding system for surround sound realism from Dolby Pro Logic II encoded audio. When used with stereo sources, the Dolby Pro Logic Decoder also enhances the sound by spreading the stereo signal to provide a &ldquo;wider&rdquo; effect. This results in a richer, fuller sound than normal stereo - almost as if it originates from outside of the headphones.2.4GHz Wireless Digital RF TechnologyThe Ear Force X41 transmits game audio to the headset with an uncompressed wireless digital radio frequency (RF) signal to deliver CD-quality sound that rivals professional-grade wired headphones. Best of all, the wireless RF signal does not require &quot;line of sight&quot; to operate. That means you can stand anywhere near your XBOX 360 and hear a clear, noise-free signal.Chat Boost&nbsp;Dynamic Talkback&nbsp;ExpanderIf you&rsquo;ve ever had trouble hearing teammates on XBOX LIVE when the game action heats up, then you know how frustrating it can be when you have to keep adjusting the chat volume. Chat Boost fixes this problem by automatically adjusting the XBOX Live chat level when the game gets louder, so chat from teammates isn't lost in the exciting parts of your game. As the game sound gets louder, Chat Boost turns up the chat volume automatically so you can still hear what everyone is saying.It's a simple solution to an annoying problem, and it all happens automatically - so you don't have to adjust anything!Microphone MonitoringIt's hard to hear yourself speak when a headset is covering your ears. The X41 corrects this annoyance with its microphone monitoring feature. The X41 adds a portion of the microphone signal into the headset signal, so you can hear a portion of your voice along with incoming chat and game audio. Microphone monitoring not only prevents you from talking too loud or accidentally yelling into the mic, it also eliminates that annoying &quot;clogged ears&quot; feeling when talking while the headset is covering your ears.Bass BoostThe X41 headset DSP also lets you turn on a Bass Boost feature that produces deep, rich bass tones by increasing the volume of low frequency sounds - just like turning up the volume on the sub-woofer on your home theater system. Bass Boost improves your gaming experience by kicking-up the sound level of explosions, gun shots and other deep-bass sound effects, making them even more dramatic.Wired Headphone ConnectionThe X41 transmitter includes a headphone output jack with volume control to connect an optional pair of wired headphones in addition to the wireless X41 headset. This jack outputs the same high-quality Dolby Headphone 7.1 surround sound that&rsquo;s being transmitted to the wireless X41 headset, which allows two people to hear the game sound at the same time.Independent Chat/Game VolumesSeparate volume controls let you adjust the game and chat levels individually, so you can easily balance them and never have to worry about missing a cue from your teammates.Advanced Battery Booster CircuitryThe X41 has a &ldquo;battery booster&rdquo; circuit that squeezes every last bit of power from the batteries and assures high quality sound until they&rsquo;re completely dead. This allows a pair of AAA Alkaline batteries to last for as long as 25 straight hours of game play. You can also buy standard rechargeable batteries in place of Alkaline batteries.Powered By USBThe transmitter is powered by a single USB port on your XBOX, or from a nearby PC or laptop. So there is no need to fuss with a separate AC power adapter.",

By now, Alfred the Great is old and feeble, unwilling and unable to repel the Danish invaders. He relies on trusty pagan warlord Uhtred, but Uhtred's temper and an unexpected violent act force Uhtred to break his oath of loyalty to Alfred and flee north with his men, intending to reclaim his ancestral home. En route, they face marauding Danish armies, betrayal, battles for a pirate treasure, and the curse of a vicious Danish witch, only to eventually be manipulated back into fighting for Alfred.

After that mission, Chavez joined the Central Intelligence Agency. Clark and Chavez developed a mentor-student relationship over the course of several missions together.Rainbow was created in 2000. Ding Chavez was made a Team Leader and began recruiting counter-terrorism operatives immediately.

But there are no guarantees in deep space. Pandora, one of these distant planets, was reported to be rich in untapped mineral wealth, and so drew many hoping to get rich quick, but in the end little was found beyond the scattered ruins of a past alien civilization. With nothing to gain, any who could soon abandoned Pandora, leaving those who remained to deal with the lawlessness of a world gone bust, and the mystery of the long-dead alien civilization. But as chaotic as these times were, there were worse days yet to come. After several years the planet's huge orbit slowly brought it near to its sun and once unknown and horrifying creatures sprang from their long hibernation to terrify the stranded colonists.

        "0060091290": "Starred Review.Deftly evoking not only the romantic tension between hero and heroine but also the conflicts and challenges of the Victorian era, this superb romance from Kleypas launches her new series centered on the Wallflowers, four young ladies who are sick of being snubbed and overlooked by London's bachelors and who have banded together to find themselves husbands. Beautiful Annabelle Peyton represents Old World aristocracy; she's genteel but impoverished and desperately trying to maintain the appearance of wealth. Commoner Simon Hunt, on the other hand, is a brash, ambitious entrepreneur who has made a fortune investing in industry and railroads and is only marginally accepted by society. As Annabelle attempts to trap a moneyed aristocrat into marriage&mdash;with the help of her vivacious fellow Wallflowers, of course&mdash;Simon boldly pursues her, first with the desire to make her his mistress and then with far more noble intentions. The scenes involving Annabelle and the three other Wallflowers&mdash;two impudent American girls and a shy, stuttering English heiress&mdash;are almost as enjoyable as the ones in which Annabelle and Simon try to outmaneuver each other. The protagonists inevitably wind up at the altar, but their story doesn't end there. Kleypas delves deeper, touching on Annabelle's changing mindset (specifically, her growing admiration of Simon's working-class roots and her acceptance of everything he stands for) and Simon's insecurity over taking her away from polite society. By turns amusing, sensual and sober, but always compelling, this is a first-rate offering from a truly talented storyteller.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0061670871": "Amazon Exclusive Essay: Marisa de los Santos onFalling Together&nbsp;I am an incorrigible homebody.  I like my own pillow, my own imperfect showerhead, my coffee and pizza and bagel shops, my little rituals.  I am quite old lady-ish about it.  I like to write in&mdash;and only in&mdash;my radically unbeautiful office (I share it with guinea pigs).  I like to drive my kids to swimming.  At night, the moment when I shut my book, turn off my bedside table light, and know that everyone is sleeping under the same roof,our roof, is as close to a state of grace as I ever hope to come.  I have always been this person.So it is probably not surprising that, until now, my writing has stuck close to home, as well.  In the first two novels, my characters did a little meandering but rarely outside of the 95 corridor, never outside of the country.  They needed no passports; they never suffered jet lag.  And now, withFalling Together, what have I done but put Will, Augusta, Jason, and my poor aviophobic Pen on airplane after airplane and sent them clear across the world?   What was I thinking?  I was thinking about the story, mostly, and that these were people who, each in her or his own way needed to go in quest of something (apart from Augusta, who has everything she needs).  Also, I was thinking that the Philippines, where my father grew up, is too beautiful, too much a part of the landscape of my heart not to write about.I visited the Philippines for the first time when I was 22 and on Christmas Day, woke up to voluminous sunshine, enfolding heat, a houseful of relatives, and a roasted suckling pig, pointy-eared, tiger&rsquo;s eye-orange, and smelling like bliss. I was not in Kansas (or Virginia) anymore.  I rode in dazzlingly painted jeepneys; I visited roadside fruit stands as resplendent as parade-floats and cemeteries in which people laughed, ate, and talked as though they were in their own living rooms and the gravestones were furniture or friends.  I atea lot:  the little fists of bread called Elordes after the boxer; rice sticky with coconut milk; fish with blue bones like a secret; fruit shaped like sea anemones, hedgehogs, brains; heavenly, palm-sized mangoes with flesh you can scoop like custard.Amid all of these discoveries, the best part was the people, a branch (or palm frond) of my family tree that I had only seen in glimpses.  Now, this family surrounded me.  I learned that traits I thought were uniquely my father&rsquo;s&mdash;having conversations with his eyebrows, a brusque, instinctive generosity that shrugged off thanks&mdash;were family or cultural traits.  I learned thathomeis a word that can stretch.  Since that first visit, I&rsquo;ve been back many times since, especially since my parents retired there six years ago, and every time,homestretches to include something new:  a coral reef, a helper&rsquo;s bewitching baby, a soup made of mung beans, a tiny tarsier&rsquo;s enormous eyes.InFalling Together, Pen goes to the Philippines in search of her friend, but I think she finds more than that.  She sits in a banca boat with a school of jackfish shoaling beneath it and thinks, awestruck, &ldquo;All this time, every second:this.&rdquo;  She experiences the world as big and small at the same time.  While I sit at my desk, drive my children around, sleep under my roof, all the time, every second, there is another version of home, my home, vibrantly alive and unfolding itself thousands of miles away.

Those parts ofMedium Raw--more of a collection of essays than a streamlined narrative--that seemed to grow out of that celebrity, such as Bourdain's feuds with food critics and celebrity chefs, impressed reviewers the least. But they still found much to savor, particularly Bourdain's biting personality, his own humorous self-deprecation, his ability to bring out the unknown elements of the restaurant industry, particularly the kitchen and service staff who might otherwise be ignored, and, not least of all, the well-written (if often vulgar) and compelling stories.

Meanwhile, Harry receives a call from Anna Bethsen, a woman he hasn't seen in years.

        "B00006HBTW": "It&#x92;s a pretty bold claim but for many,Mario Partyis the best multiplayer game series ever. No need for guns or complicated role-playing elements here--Mario Partyis fun because it&#x92;s simple. The original N64 game created an entirely new subgenre--an unlikely combination of traditional board games and lots of ultrasimple arcade titles. The idea is that you travel around the board trying to collect stars, which must be paid for with coins, and you get coins by competing in minigames, which occur at the end of every round. These minigames generally don&#x92;t last longer than a minute or two, and many are based on oldGame & Watchtitles. There are over 50 minigames inMario Party 4, and each involves either a free-for-all, two players against two, or one against three (depending where you land on the board at the end of your turn). These can involve anything from skydiving to basketball dunking, or car racing to hide-and-seek, to name a few.Admittedly, this basic description of the gameplay might not sound too exciting, and indeed if you&#x92;re playing with less than three human opponents it can be pretty tedious. But play it with the full complement of non-virtual rivals and the game&#x92;s infinite capacity for cheating, backstabbing, and ganging up allows it to completely transcend the humdrum sum of its parts. There&#x92;s nothing terribly new in this third sequel except that the graphics are much improved and the minigames are all new, but that really misses the point: get this game out at Christmas instead ofTrivial Pursuitand you&#x92;ll wonder how you ever got through the holiday without it.--David Jenkins, Amazon.co.uk",

It is also the land of Cate Cooper's childhood, the place where all the ghosts of her past roam freely. Cate never thought she'd wind up in this tiny cottage named the Porgy House on this breathtakingly lovely strip of coast. But circumstances have changed, thanks to her newly dead husband whose financial&mdash;and emotional&mdash;bull and mendacity have left Cate homeless, broke, and unmoored.Yet Folly Beach holds more than just memories. Once upon a time another woman found unexpected bliss and comfort within its welcoming arms. An artist, writer, and colleague of the revered George Gershwin, Dorothy Heyward enjoyed the greatest moments of her life at Folly with her beloved husband, DuBose. And though the Heywards are long gone, their passion and spirit lingers in every mango sunset and gentle ocean breeze.And for Cate, Folly, too, holds the promise of unexpected fulfillment when she is forced to look at her life and the zany characters that are her family anew. To her surprise, she will discover that you can go home again. Folly Beach doesn't just hold the girl she once was&hellip; it also holds the promise of the woman she's always wanted&mdash;and is finally ready&mdash;to become.Folly Beach, filled with the irresistible charm, saucy wit, and lush atmosphere that have won her the devotion of fans and propelled her books to bestsellerdom, is vintage Dorothea Benton Frank.A Look InsideFolly BeachClick on the images below to open larger versions.Dorothy and DuBose Heyward,from the Collections of the South Carolina Historical Society.Tourist brochure of Folly Beach,from the Collections of the South Carolina Historical Society.The way to thebeach from Porgy House. Photo credit: Kathy Glick.PorgyHouse on Folly Beach. Photo credit: Kathy Glick.Dorothea Benton Frank on WritingFolly BeachLast summer, I went down to the South Carolina Historical Society and read the papers of Dorothy and DuBose Heyward, thinking that it was DuBose who wrotePorgy and Besswith George Gershwin on Folly Beach during the summer of 1934.  Not true.My first discovery was that DuBose was a high school dropout and that Dorothy, a young orphan,  was unusually well educated and already an award winning playwright when they married. Then I discovered the huge economic disparities between them. Dorothy was wealthy and although DuBose was comfortable at the time they met, he had grown up in poverty. I ran across a copy of her birth certificate, on which her name is &ldquo;Dorothea&rdquo;&mdash;my name&mdash;and letterhead that stated she lived on Fifth and Twelfth in Manhattan&mdash;my old address&mdash; on and on.  Every time I turned around, it seemed I was bumping into another coincidence. Okay, I thought, there&rsquo;s a story here and I&rsquo;m going to try and tell it. Who wasDorothyHeyward?  And what happened that summer on Folly Beach?It is historic fact that Dorothy herself adapted DuBose&rsquo;s bookPorgyfor the stage and that she also had a great hand in creating the adaptation ofMamba&rsquo;s Daughtersfor the stage, the two most successful works with DuBose Heyward&rsquo;s name attached to them. But she shied away from taking credit for herself and spent her widowhood making sure that DuBose&rsquo;s name appeared in the credits of all of Gershwin&rsquo;s productions ofPorgy and Bessso that his estate would receive the royalties that were due.What is in those boxes at the SCHS is there because it was what Dorothy wanted us to see. Every single letter from her to DuBose is absent. Perhaps he did not save her letters or perhaps she disposed of them. We will never know. But it appears that Dorothy wanted us to have a one-sided conversation with DuBose, not her. Dorothy always wanted DuBose to be the celebrity, the icon, the one who was remembered and revered. She loved him that much.And, finally, while Dorothy Heyward may have wanted to disappear into history as &ldquo;just a girl from Ohio who wanted a career on the other side of the footlights,&rdquo; the facts appear differently to me. True, she was diminutive in the extreme, and the fact that she was from Ohio may have left her more easily dismissed by DuBose&rsquo;s crowd of aristocratic old Charlestonians.  But Dorothy Kuhns Heyward was a powerhouse, who married into one of Charleston&rsquo;s most prestigious families and spent her life doing everything she could for the man she fiercely loved who was, for his time, a civil rights pioneer.  My new novel explores their lifelong collaboration, their devotion to each other and what magic happened on Folly Beach in 1934 and in 2010, both periods of fascinating self-discovery.",

Beloved illustrator Jan Brett's version ofThe Night Before Christmaslets these two mischievous elves add their rambunctious spirit to this familiar 1823 rhyming story. Here, Santa and his reindeer land on the snowy roof of a Victorian mansion in New England. While Santa delivers the toys inside, the elves and the reindeer frolic around the lawn, as a pig (earmarked for a girl named Jan) and a few alphabet blocks spill out of sacks into the snow. Santa swiftly reins in the mischief-makers and \"away they all flew like the down on a thistle.\" Brett's richly illustrated borders are lavishly decorated with antique toys, ornaments, and sweet treats, all surrounded with twisting golden ribbons.

        "0060955775": "When Paulo Coelho (The Alchemist) was a young man, his parents had him committed to mental hospitals three times because he wanted to be an artist--an unacceptable profession in Brazil at the time. During his numerous forced incarcerations he vowed to write some day about his experiences and the injustices of involuntary commitment. In this fable-like novel, Coelho makes good on his promise, with the creation of a fictional character named Veronika who decides to kill herself when faced with all that is wrong with the world and how powerless she feels to change anything. Although she survives her initial suicide attempt, she is committed to a mental hospital where she begins to wrestle with the meaning of mental illness and whether forced drugging should be inflicted on patients who don't fit into the narrow definition of \"normal.\" The strength and tragedy of Veronika's fictional story was instrumental in passing new government regulations in Brazil that have made it more difficult to have a person involuntarily committed.

        "B00002DHEV": "Nintendo first dabbled in video games during the industry's early years of the mid-'70s. Generations of successful gaming console releases through the years led to the much-hyped 1996 launch of Nintendo 64, a system that represented a giant evolutionary leap in video game technology. Within the first three days of launch, hundreds of thousands of gamers hunkered down withMario 64, considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever created. Even today, the system's excellent design continues to host an ever-expanding library of breakthrough games.Nintendo 64's popularity among younger gamers is no surprise. Well-respected games featuring such long-lived and much-loved personalities as Mario (of arcade classicDonkey Kongfame), Zelda, andBanjo-Kazooieare easy to learn and offer enormous replay value. But times are a' changin' and the system's ever-growing library of titles has expanded into every genre of games imaginable, including games better-suited for older gamers. In fact, some of the most acclaimed--in some cases, groundbreaking--games available on any platform today are packed onto N64's old-school cartridges.Under the system's hood, its appeal to the young certainly didn't produce a less mature gaming machine. On the contrary, the 64-bit system boasts impressive graphics, stereo sound, and numerous accessory enhancements, including a high-resolution pack that boosts graphics to awe-inspiring resolutions.Start your library withGoldeneye 007,Mario 64,Banjo Kazooie,Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, andStar Wars: Episode One Racer--these titles represent a decent start to any N64 cartridge library.With the recent launch of Sega's Dreamcast system, Nintendo 64 is being left behind as the leader in video game technology. And with newer game systems featuring CD-based games, the system's expensive cartridge format is proving itself an archaic and unconventional storage format. But, at a sub-$100 recommended retail price, innovative accessory enhancements and a great library of games keep the system's rabid fan base satisfied, if not eager for Nintendo's next evolutionary step.--Eric Twelker",
        "0006550436": "At the beginning of Amy Tan's fourth novel, two packets of papers written in Chinese calligraphy fall into the hands of Ruth Young. One bundle is titledThings I Know Are Trueand the other,Things I Must Not Forget. The author? That would be the protagonist's mother, LuLing, who has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. In these documents the elderly matriarch, born in China in 1916, has set down a record of her birth and family history, determined to keep the facts from vanishing as her mind deteriorates.A San Francisco career woman who makes her living by ghostwriting self-help books, Ruth has little idea of her mother's past or true identity. What's more, their relationship has tended to be an angry one. Still, Ruth recognizes the onset of LuLing's decline--along with her own remorse over past rancor--and hires a translator to decipher the packets. She also resolves to \"ask her mother to tell her about her life. For once, she would ask. She would listen. She would sit down and not be in a hurry or have anything else to do.\"Framed at either end by Ruth's chapters, the central portion ofThe Bonesetter's Daughtertakes place in China in the remote, mountainous region where anthropologists discovered Peking Man in the 1920s. Here superstition and tradition rule over a succession of tiny villages. And here LuLing grows up under the watchful eye of her hideously scarred nursemaid, Precious Auntie. As she makes clear, it's not an enviable setting:I noticed the ripe stench of a pig pasture, the pockmarked land dug up by dragon-bone dream-seekers, the holes in the walls, the mud by the wells, the dustiness of the unpaved roads. I saw how all the women we passed, young and old, had the same bland face, sleepy eyes that were mirrors of their sleepy minds.Nor is rural isolation the worst of it. LuLing's family, a clan of ink makers, believes itself cursed by its connection to a local doctor, who cooks up his potions and remedies from human bones. And indeed, a great deal of bad luck befalls the narrator and her sister GaoLing before they can finally engineer their escape from China. Along the way, familial squabbles erupt around every corner, particularly among mothers, daughters, and sisters. And as she did in her earlierThe Joy Luck Club, Amy Tan uses these conflicts to explore the intricate dynamic that exists between first-generation Americans and their immigrant elders.--Victoria Jenkins--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",
        "0062130358": "*Starred Review* This autobiography of a retired USAF F-16 pilot will remind seasoned readers of Jack Broughton&#x2019;s classic Thud Ridge (1969). It certainly offers the same gripping cockpit view of modern air combat, in this case over Iraq in two wars and patrolling U.S. skies after 9/11. Hampton recounts his training as a pilot, then his selection for F-16s&#x2014;officially the Fighting Falcon but known in the USAF as the Viper&#x2014;and finally his training for the most demanding flying done in the F-16, the Wild Weasel missions. These missions are dedicated to the neutralization or, preferably, destruction of enemy air defenses and date back to the first encounters with SAMs, in the Vietnam War. As the radars and missiles on the ground have improved, so have the technology and skills of the Wild Weasel pilots, who must keep themselves and their comrades alive in an air full of high-tech hostility. Hampton is a vivid writer and an unabashed warrior, and, like most such, he has doubts about the future of American armed forces if they are to be commanded by men who are neither warriors themselves nor particularly empathetic toward those who are. An outstanding work. --Roland Green",

The tale begins with a poor slave boy named Shasta escaping from his adopted fisherman father who plans to sell him to a brutish stranger. A dignified talking war horse named Bree helps Shasta flee. Jennings plays Shasta with refreshing gentleness-listeners get a sense of the boy's sensitivity and fear as he embarks on the adventure of his life. The talented narrator plays Bree with the right amount of dignity and haughtiness. This horse amuses with his witty observations about human behavior, and sense of equine superiority. The horse and his boy hope to travel north to Narnia, and encounter numerous adventures and strange characters, all beautifully portrayed by Jennings. The most memorable supporting characters are another escaped child, a tough girl named Aravis, and her talking mare called Hwin. Jennings brings these two adventure seekers to life with his crystal clear narration. Thanks to his skills as a storyteller, the action moves rapidly from one exciting episode to the next. Evocative music plays at the beginning and end of each side of the tape. This presentation will enchant young listeners and encourage them to read the other titles in the series. It is helpful for students to have read The Magician's Nephew and The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe before enjoying this, but The Horse and the Boy stands alone as enthralling, self-contained entertainment.Brian E.

As with similar games, the  viewpoint can be awkward at times, especially during combat, which here  is so clunky that you should try to avoid it whenever possible--something  you should do anyway, as this isn'tTomb Raider.Rather than resort to cheap scare tactics,Silent Hillfeatures  a gameplay twist that works very well with its limited visibility  environments. Harry carries a radio with him that crackles with static  whenever the game's nasties are near, and continues until they're no  longer in the vicinity or have been killed off.

Zukav explains the concept further:The Wu Li Master dances with his student. The Wu Li Master does not teach, but the student learns. The Wu Li Master always begins at the center, the heart of the matter.... This book deals not with knowledge, which is always past tense anyway, but with imagination, which is physics come alive, which is Wu Li.... Most people believe that physicists are explaining the world. Some physicists even believe that, but the Wu Li Masters know that they are only dancing with it.The \"new physics\" of Zukav's 1979 book comprises quantum theory, particle physics, and relativity.

As in previous installments, here you play as a thug with problems you must steal and shoot your way out of, but the problems this time are disconcertingly more realistic. You play as Carl Johnson, known on the street as CJ, a likeable criminal type who has just returned to his hometown, Los Santos (a fictionalized Los Angeles), to find that his mother has been murdered and that the police have framed him for another murder. Reunions with his friends and a troubled relationship with his brother set off a sprawling, complex plot line, taking place at first in the immediate Los Santos area but eventually spilling into San Fierro (based on San Francisco) and Las Venturas (Las Vegas).You play as Carl Johnson, known on the street as CJ.This is an honest effort to create an engaging story about sympathetic characters caught up in a brutal environment that is on par with a movie or novel.Gaming GangstersWhereVice Citytook its cues, with tongue firmly in cheek, from the 1980s television seriesMiami Vice,San Andreasis a sincere homage to early 1990s innercity gangster films likeMenace 2 SocietyandBoyz &lsquo;N the Hood. This is an honest effort to create an engaging story about sympathetic characters caught up in a brutal environment that is on par with a movie or novel. If that effort hits a few flat notes (you would have to be totally desensitized not to wonder if it's OK to make entertainment out of driveby shootings), it may also mark the first step toward video games growing up.  The first thing that fans of earlierGTAgames will notice is the range of action is much wider now: Along with shooting, running, and driving, there's now swimming, eating, working out, shopping, and, yes, getting a haircut. All this means the game has a fairly steep learning curve. But, though the pick-up-and-play appeal ofGrand Theft Auto IIImay be long gone, your access to the action becomes fairly transparent after a little practice. My only serious complaint is that, with the controller now crowded with such previously unheard-of functions like \"Gang Active\" and \"Talk Positive,\" you can drive only with the left analog stick. A minor point, but it makes cars a lot more difficult to handle.Bicycles take on a surprisingly central role.Vehicular VarietyIt would be hard to surpass the variety of automobiles available in earlier games, andSan Andreaswisely does not for the most part try to compete on that score. Instead, it's bicycles of all things that steal the show. The bikes' speed and flexibility are perfect for many of the missions, and there is something about cruising through the streets and basketball courts on a BMX that just feels right. If you play far enough into the game, you will also be rewarded with the chance to fly a number of aircraft, and flying is something Rockstar makes a greater effort to get right this time (welcome news for anyone who struggled with the planes and &lsquo;copters of the earlier games).Lackluster Graphics--but a Real FeelGraphics--never a huge priority for Rockstar--actually take a step backward from the luscious, tropical look ofVice City. Textures are rendered with only a cursory attention to detail, and contours are often blocky. It scarcely matters, though, because no matter howSan Andreaslooks, itfeelsreal. This is due in no small part to voice work by an all-star cast including Samuel L. Jackson, Ice T, James Woods, Peter Fonda, and Outkast's Big Boy and a stellar soundtrack with tunes by Soundgarden, 2Pac, Public Enemy, and even a few country classics from the likes of Willie Nelson. But it's not just realistic,San Andreasis also vast, encompassing three big urban centers and huge swaths of rural land (complete with shotgun-toting farmers) between them. This vastness does mean, however, that there can be a lot of tedious driving to get to the missions, which, along with some awkward sequencing of the cut scenes (they are in places stacked one on top of the other), means that there is a bit too much downtime.  But never mind the quibbles.

Mr. Poe, their  ineffective legal guardian, having exhausted all options for finding them a new home with relatives  (including their 19th cousin), sadly entrusts his young charges' fate to a progressive guardian program formed  with the premise \"It takes a village to raise a child.\" Before they know it, the Baudelaires are being whisked  off on a bus to a village (vile) named \"V.F.D.\" Snicket fans who readThe Austere AcademyandThe Ersatz Elevatorwill jump to see these three  initials, as they provide a clue to the tragic disappearance of the Baudelaires' friends, the beloved, equally  orphaned Quagmire triplets.To the orphans' dismay, V.F.D. is covered in crows--so much so that the whole village is pitch-black and  trembling. \"The crows weren't squawking or cawing, which is what crows often do, or playing the trumpet,  which crows practically never do, but the town was far from silent. The air was filled with the sounds the  crows made as they moved around.\" Another disturbing element of the town is that the Council of Elders  (who wear creepy crow hats) has thousands of rules, such as \"don't hurt crows\" and \"don't build mechanical  devices.\" Fortunately, the Baudelaires are taken in by a kindly handyman named Hector who cooks them  delicious Mexican food and secretly breaks rules. Still, neither Hector nor an entire village can protect the  orphans from the clutches of the money-grubbing Count Olaf, who has relentlessly pursued them (actually,  just their fortune) sinceThe Bad Beginning.

        "0060530928": "InThe Graveyard Book, Neil Gaiman has created a charming allegory of childhood. Although the book opens with a scary scene--a family is stabbed to death by \"a man named Jack&#x201D; --the story quickly moves into more child-friendly storytelling.  The sole survivor of the attack--an 18-month-old baby--escapes his crib and his house, and toddles to a nearby graveyard. Quickly recognizing that the baby is orphaned, the graveyard's ghostly residents adopt  him, name him Nobody (\"Bod\"), and allow him to live in their tomb. Taking inspiration from Kipling&#x2019;sThe Jungle Book, Gaiman describes how the toddler navigates among the headstones, asking a lot of questions and picking up the tricks of the living and the dead. In serial-like episodes, the story follows Bod's progress as he grows from baby to teen, learning life&#x2019;s lessons amid a cadre of the long-dead, ghouls, witches, intermittent human interlopers.  A pallid, nocturnal guardian named Silas ensures that Bod receives food, books, and anything else he might need from the human world. Whenever the boy strays from his usual play among the headstones, he finds new dangers, learns his limitations and strengths, and acquires the skills he needs to survive within the confines of the graveyard and in wider world beyond.

If it's not quite a novel, less believable in its way than his augmented memoir ever was, there's no doubt it's a work of Frey's imagination. Ironic, isn't it?Set in contemporary Los Angeles,Bright Shiny Morningis not a cohesive narrative but a compilation of vignettes of several characters (if this were a memoir, we'd call them composites) who have come to the city to fulfill their dreams. Some examples: Dylan and Maddie, madly-in-love Midwestern runaways who survive through the kindness of near strangers; Esperanza, a Mexican-American maid tortured by a body that could have been drawn by R. Crumb; a group of drunks and junkies who create a community behind the shacks on Venice Beach; Amberton Parker, a hugely famous married movie star who is secretly&mdash;you guessed it&mdash;gay. Interspersed with these rotating portraits are random historical and statistical factoids (which better have been fact-checked, even if there is a nudge-nudge, wink-wink disclaimer up front: Nothing in this book should be considered accurate or reliable) about L.A.: that, for example, approximately 2.7 million people live without health insurance and there are more than 12,000 people who describe their job asbill collectorin the City of Los Angeles. Frey's intention, it seems, is to create an onomatopoetic jumble, a cacophony of facts and fiction, stats and stories, that replicate the contradictory nature of the place they describe. I expect, given the sharpness of the knives that some critics have out for Frey, that many will say the book flat out doesn't work. First off, there's that voice, the hyperbolic, breathless, run-on, word-repeating voice that was much better suited to a memoir (or even a novel) in which the hero was a hyperbolic, breathless alcoholic and drug addict. And then there's the frat-boy swagger that angered some readers ofAMLPturning up here, too, so faux-cynical as to be na&iuml;ve: the gang father's attaboy about his five-year-old son's desire to be a cold-blooded killer, and the prurient, adolescent take on sex. (And couldn't someone have stopped him from exclaiming woohoo after some of his fun and not fun factoids?) Yet the guy has something: an energy, a drive, a relentlessness, maybe, that can pull readers along, past the voice, past the stock characters, past the clich&eacute;s.Bright Shiny Morningis a train wreck of a novel, but it's un-put-downable, a real page-turner&mdash;in what may come to be known as the Frey tradition.Sara Nelson is the editor-in-chief ofPublishers Weekly.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "009949308X": "Amazon Exclusive: Liaquat Ahamed on the Economic ClimateIn December 1930, the great economist Maynard Keynes published an article in which he described the world as living in &#x201C;the shadows of one of the greatest economic catastrophes in modern history.&#x201D;  The world was then 18 months into what would become the Great Depression. The stock market was down about 60%, profits had fallen in half and unemployed had climbed from 4% to about 10%.If you take our present situation, 16 months into the current recession, we're about at the same place.  The stock market is down 50 to 60 percent, profits are down 50 percent, unemployment is up from 4.5% to over 8%.Over the next 18 months between January 1930 and July 1932 the bottom fell out of the world economy. It did so because the authorities applied the wrong medicine to what was a very sick economy. They let the banking system go under, they tried to cut the budget deficit by curbing government expenditure and raising taxes, they refused to assist the European banking system, and they even raised interest rates. It was no wonder the global economy crumbled.Luckily with the benefit of those lessons, we now know what not to do. This time the authorities are applying the right medicine: they have cut interest rates to zero and are keeping them there, they have saved the banking system from collapse and they have introduced the largest stimulus package in history.And yet I cannot help worrying that the world economy may yet spiral downwards. There are two areas in particular that keep me up at night.The first is the U.S. banking system. Back in the fall, the authorities managed to prevent a financial meltdown. People are not pulling money out of banks anymore&#x2014;in fact, they are putting money in. The problem is that as a consequence of past bad loans, the banking system has lost a good part of its capital. There is no way that the economy can recover unless the banking system is recapitalized. While there are many technical issues about the best way to do this, most experts agree that it will not be done without a massive injection of public money, possibly as much as $1 trillion from you and me, the taxpayer.At the moment tax payers are so furious at the irresponsibility of the bankers who got us into this mess that they are in no mood to support yet more money to bail out banks. It is going to take an extraordinary act of political leadership to persuade the American public that unfortunately more money is necessary to solve this crisis.The second area that keeps me up at night is Europe. During the real estate bubble years, the 13 countries of Eastern Europe that were once part of the Soviet empire had their own bubble. They now owe a gigantic $1.3 trillion dollars, much of which they won&#x2019;t be able to pay. The burden will have to fall on the tax payers of Western Europe, especially Germany and France.In the U.S. we at least have the national cohesion and the political machinery to get New Yorkers and Midwesterners to pay for the mistakes of Californian and Floridian homeowners or to bail out a bank based in North Carolina. There is no such mechanism in Europe. It is going to require political leadership of the highest order from the leaders of Germany and France to persuade their thrifty and prudent taxpayers to bail out foolhardy Austrian banks or Hungarian homeowners.The Great Depression was largely caused by a failure of intellectual will&#x2014;the men in charge simply did not understand how the economy worked. The risk this time round is that a failure of political will leads us into an economic cataclysm.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

O'Neal portrays her divorced parents (actors Joanna Moore and Ryan O'Neal) as neglectful and abusive, with drug problems of their own. Though O'Neal appeared in such kid-fodder movies asThe Bad News BearsandLittle Darlings, she says that during the '70s and early '80s she battled depression and attempted suicide. \"I found that coke made me feel so much better,\" she recounts in the straightforward though unoriginal language that characterizes the narrative.

        "B00005QDPZ": "Star Wars Rogue Leader: Rogue Squadron IIfeatures some of the  best graphics ever seen on a home console, and it is a proper, old-fashioned,Star Warsgame. If those two facts don't raise at least an eyebrow of  your interest, then there's probably not much in the world of video games that  will. Thankfully, the jaw-dropping graphics are matched up to a very playable  shoot-'em-up concept that works as a slightly more in-depth version of the PS2'sStar Wars Starfighter,  except without any of thatEpisode Inonsense. Rather, it re-creates  everything from the Death Star trench run to the Battle of Hoth.The game is actually a sequel toRogue Squadronfor the N64--an excellent  game that many only remember from the rather lackluster PC version. It's  structurally very similar to the original, with a dozen or so levels and a Star  Destroyer full of secret levels and ships. The game does feature a few new  ideas, such as controllable wingmen and ground troops, and some of the levels  are set in deep space rather than planetside, but at its heart this is stillRogue Squadrondeluxe.What elevates the game to an object of worship is the graphics--they really do  look almost identical to the movie's, with several scenes appearing like exact  copies. The ships move with a fluidity and grace you wouldn't have thought  possible from such a tiny purple cube. The only flaw is that the missions are  needlessly short, but there's plenty of replayability, and by gosh there's those  graphics.--David Jenkins--Amazon.co.uk",

        "B00005QEFD": "Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

Denny meets and marries Eve, has a daughter, Zo&euml;, and risks his savings and his life to make it on the professional racing circuit. Enzo, frustrated by his inability to speak and his lack of opposable thumbs, watches Denny's old racing videos, coins koanlike aphorisms that apply to both driving and life, and hopes for the day when his life as a dog will be over and he can be reborn a man. When Denny hits an extended rough patch, Enzo remains his most steadfast if silent supporter. Enzo is a reliable companion and a likable enough narrator, though the string of Denny's bad luck stories strains believability.

Trouble arises when the Norse Viking brothers Sigefrid and Erik Thurgilson capture and occupy London, threatening Alfred's border and his control of the Thames River port. The Christian Alfred directs Uhtred to raise a Wessex army, expel the pagan Thurgilsons and resecure London. Commanding Uhtred is his vain, abusive cousin Ethelred, who is married to Alfred's eldest daughter, Ethelflaed.

        "0061766720": "AmazonBest of the Month, June 2009:The story itself could take your breath away: an 11-year-old boy, the only survivor of a small-plane crash in the San Gabriel Mountains in 1979, makes his way to safety down an icy mountain face in a blizzard, using the skills and determination he learned from his father. But it's the way that Norman Ollestad tells his tale that makesCrazy for the Storma memoir that will last. He almost has too much to tell: a way-larger-than-life father--former child actor, FBI man (who took on Hoover in acontroversial book), and surfer who drove his son to test his limits in the surf and on the slopes; a youth spent in the short-lived counterculture paradise of Topanga Canyon; a stepfather who could give Tobias Wolff's a run for his money; and of course the crash. But writing 30 years later, Ollestad is wise and talented enough to focus his story on the essentials, cutting elegantly back and forth between a moment-by-moment account of the crash and his memories of the difficult but often idyllic year leading up to it. More than a story of survival, it's a time-tempered reckoning with what it means to be a father and a son. --Tom NissleyAmazon Exclusive Essay:It Starts With a Good Storyby Norman OllestadIt was time for my eight-year old son, Noah, to read before bed. \"Eh,\" he groaned. \"Reading is so boring. It sucks.\" He&rsquo;d been reciting this same mantra for months. I was resting beside him in his bed and I saw his whole life crumble--a slew of poor report cards and father-son arguments, ending in long term unemployment. \"What about Dr. Seuss?\" I reasoned. He glared at me with his brown eyes. \"It's okay,\" he mumbled. I opened the book he was reading for his class and handed it to him. He stared at it, mute. \"Noah,\" I said from my lowest register. He proceeded to read at a snail's pace and I pointed out that it would take him twice as long as usual to get through the required five pages. So he ran the words together, not even stopping at periods. I grabbed the book and told him we'd be reading all weekend to make up for his lack of cooperation. For months I coerced him like that, urging him past his lazy monotone, trying to get him to connect with the story. It was a long few months.When I was Noah's age I also disliked reading. I just wanted to hear the story without having to work for it. I had wished my dad could work the same kind of magic he did with surfing: he'd push me into the waves so that I could simply enjoy the ride, eliminating the most arduous, frustrating part of surfing--paddling for the wave.My father was always asking my mother, who was a grade-school teacher, why I wasn't a better reader. She advocated patience, and encouraged me by tirelessly pointing out things in each story that I might relate to. My father was killed when I was eleven, so he never got to witness my eventual love of reading.In order to help Noah find that love, I searched for a seminal moment in my past that had transformed me. There was no single thing. But during my reminiscences I flashed on Dad reading aloud my grandparents' monthly letters from Mexico. They had retired to Puerto Vallarta and their letters were filled with stories. Stories about an inland village where Grandpa went twice a week to buy ice for their fridge, to keep their food cold. Stories about helping a Mexican family after a hurricane hit Puerto Vallarta. Stories of secret waterfalls and secluded isthmuses that Grandpa and Grandma had discovered around Vallarta. And that&rsquo;s when it hit me--it was very simple: the essence of my love for reading really emanates from my love for stories.\"How about I tell you a story tonight,\" I whispered with great zeal to Noah. His eyes lit up and he smiled. \"What kind of story?\"\"Any kind,\" I said.\"A story about a magic skateboard would be cool,\" he suggested. As I spun the impromptu tale, he rolled onto his side and stared at me, totally focused. The following night I made a bargain with him: \"First read five pages, then I'll work up a story about whatever you want.\" Before I got myself nestled beside him, he was halfway through the first page. Progressively, Noah's topics became more elaborate, and soon he was giving me outlines for stories. Somewhere along the line his reading voice changed--he was gobbling up the sentences, his voice alive with inflection. He'd broken through. Noah was hooked on stories, like I got hooked on riding waves. Once he'd experienced the pleasure of going on that narrative ride, reading became second nature, like paddling for a wave. It all starts with a good story.Photographs fromCrazy For the Storm(Click to Enlarge)My first surfboard, Topanga Beach, 1968Mom, Dad, and Me, Topanga Beach, 1968Dad in St. Anton, Austria, Early 1970'sSt. Anton with DadMe, Ski racingSkiing with DadPuerto Vallarta, 1975Three generations of Normans, 1977",

When we first meet Greta Wells, she lives in 1985 Greenwich Village and is mightily depressed by the death of her beloved gay twin brother from an unnamed disease that is clearly AIDS.  On the advice of her psychiatrist, she begins shock treatments, which somehow let her travel to her would-have-been life in 1918, and one in 1943. Surrounded by the same people in the garb and custom of the various eras--her dead brother&rsquo;s lover, a slightly nutty Aunt who made me think of Endora from TV&rsquo;s Bewitched, and the lover who eventually leaves her in 1985--Greta (and we) come to see  that things never really change and that, as they say, Wherever you go, there you are. Deftly and with great heart, Greer shows us that sadness is universal and timeless. But then, so is love.  --Sara Nelson",

He gets laid more often than he masturbates, plays video games, goes to the gym, sizes up every bitch in sight and, understandably, hates Casey, his vapid wannabe-actress girlfriend who tricks him into agreeing to marry her. He is not happy about this. Adding to his reluctance is his burgeoning \"relationship\" with hottie Alyna, a UCLA student who-just as Casey is an exaggerated caricature of What Men Don't Want-is the Dream Girl who likes video games and porn-style sex. (Also, Casey has a \"fat ass\" whereas Alyna has a \"perfect ass.\") [...] Despite the book's purported \"brutal honesty,\" the premise is essentially: guys like sex and dislike cuddling.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Accompanied by Sparx the dragonfly, Spyro sets out to free his buddies, while collecting gems and dragon eggs. Sparx also serves as Spyro's health-o-meter, glowing gold when Spyro is healthy and turning dusky green as he tires. To boost his energy, Spryo can blast docile creatures with fire, turning them into butterflies, which Sparx transforms into much-needed fuel.This title has bright graphics in six well-developed worlds, each with several subworlds, including bogs, deserts, and ice worlds. Unlike some action games, inSpyro the Dragonthe enemies are more fun than frightening. In the Peace Keepers world, for example, Spyro must burn down the monster soldiers' tent, sending one of the minions running out, quaking with fear or, if you're lucky, dropping his drawers and shooting a moon.Spyro's movements (fire breathing, gliding, jumping, and climbing) require entry-level gaming skills.

        "0062224840": "In this modern take on My Fair Lady, obese young widow Holly becomes the special project of Logan Montgomery, a personal trainer whose typical clients are professional athletes. As Logan reshapes Holly&#x2019;s body and helps her deal with the emotional reasons she binge-eats, the two first become friends and then an attraction grows. Logan has never been with anyone like Holly before; his typical conquests are model-beautiful women who aren&#x2019;t looking for commitment. When their relationship becomes physical, they keep it secret owing to Logan&#x2019;s discomfort and Holly&#x2019;s insecurities, but soon Holly realizes that she deserves to be in a relationship with someone who accepts her imperfections. Evanovich&#x2019;s debut effort is a funny, clever, and well-paced read, but it lacks polish. Holly is a sympathetic protagonist and Logan has his charming moments, but the novel sends mixed messages about body image, self-esteem, and seeking male approval. --Aleksandra Walker",

        "000712774X": "ThatThe Illustrated Manhas remained in print since being  published in 1951 is fair testimony to the universal appeal of Ray Bradbury's work. Only his second collection (the first wasDark Carnival, later reworked intoThe October Country), it is a marvelous, if mostly dark, quilt of science fiction, fantasy, and horror. In an ingenious framework to open and close the book, Bradbury presents himself as a nameless narrator who meets the Illustrated Man--a wanderer whose entire body is a living canvas of exotic tattoos. What's even more remarkable, and increasingly disturbing, is that the illustrations are themselves magically alive, and each proceeds to unfold its own story, such as \"The Veldt,\" wherein rowdy children take a game of virtual reality way over the edge. Or \"Kaleidoscope,\" a heartbreaking portrait of stranded astronauts about to reenter our atmosphere--without the benefit of a spaceship. Or \"Zero Hour,\" in which invading aliens have discovered a most logical ally--our own children. Even though most were written in the 1940s and 1950s, these 18 classic stories will be just as chillingly effective 50 years from now.--Stanley Wiater--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",
        "0062077562": "A literary work as suspenseful as the best thrillers, Funder&#x2019;s extraordinary first novel is an unflinching portrait of courage in devastating circumstances. The tale unfolds through the dual reminiscences of Ruth Becker, an elderly resident of Sydney in 2001, and Ernst Toller, eminent playwright and former leader of the short-lived Bavarian Republic. Both belonged to a group of left-wing German activists who were forced into exile in London after Hitler came to power, and who risked everything to alert the world&#x2014;especially Britain, whose deliberate blindness grows increasingly infuriating in the novel&#x2014;to the danger the Nazis posed. Settled into New York&#x2019;s Mayflower Hotel in 1939, Toller reworks his autobiography to make the woman who was its emotional heart live once again. Dora Fabian was Ruth&#x2019;s cousin and Toller&#x2019;s lover, and the passionate intensity that defines her political and personal existence blazes through these pages. The moral dilemmas affecting Funder&#x2019;s characters, all based on historical figures, are as strongly evoked as the repressive environment they inhabit and are brave enough to stand against. --Sarah Johnson",

        "0061655961": "Amazon Exclusive: Lisa Gardner Interviews Andrew GrossNew York Timesbestselling crime novelistLisa Gardnerbegan her career in food service, but after catching her hair on fire numerous times, she took the hint and focused on writing instead. A self-described research junkie, she has parlayed her interest in police procedure, cutting edge forensics and twisted plots into a streak of eleven bestselling suspense novels, including her most recent release,Love You More.&nbsp;Lisa Gardner:First, the question I&rsquo;ve always wanted to ask another author: Where do you get your ideas?Andrew Gross:It's just that if I told you I&rsquo;d have to kill you Lisa, and you're so nice&hellip;   Actually, as we both know, that process varies, and every author has his or her own path. You just pray like hell they come when you need them!For me, this is the hardest and most stressful hurdle in what I do. The writing comes easy! For my last three books, I took conspiratorial headlines from the news&mdash;Iraq War scandals; people who used 9/11 to disappear from their life; the Wall Street financial meltdown&mdash;and wrapped them around more local and personal stories: a harrowing home invasion gone tragically wrong or a wife who wakes up one day to find her dead husband wasn't at all the person she thought she knew. Stories that I thought could achieve the emotional resonance I strive for in my books.Eyes Wide Opentook shape from two real life events straight from my own past. One was the sad suicide of my young nephew, a troubled kid, who was found at the bottom of a landmark cliff in central California. The second was a chance encounter forty years ago with none other than, ahem, Charles Manson! You&rsquo;ll have to read it to see how these stories link.Blind Curve, the book I&rsquo;m working on now, sprang from a crazy incident that happened to me last year while on my book tour. I was pulled out of my car for a minor traffic violation&mdash;an incident that escalated into my being thrown into cuffs and told I was going to jail. Except in my story, the hero doesn't get off as easily as I did.As long as events like these keep happening to me, I&rsquo;ll be in good shape!LG:Your last novel,Reckless, was a &ldquo;ripped from the headlines&rdquo; sort of novel, whereasEyes Wide Opendraws from events in your life. What prompted you to pull from your personal experiences this time around, and how hard was that to write?AG:It's much, much, much harder to write a story from your own life that affects real people, and some of them people you care for&mdash;especially those who have suffered tragedy, like me brother. On the other hand, drawing from personal experience makes for a much more enriching and rewarding story, one that is filled with the detail and resonance of real life. I wanted to write a poignant, personal testament to my nephew that was also a thriller, using a theme I seem to carry from book to book&mdash;a family hiding a secret past; in this case, revolving around teenage suicide, sons fighting against their fathers, the L.A. music scene in the &rsquo;60s, and an encounter with that Manson-like figure. Hopefully what came out is a chilling, rich, autobiographical, and satisfying tale filled with the kind of richness and family lore that you usually find in a memoir. While writingEyes Wide Openfrom events in my own life was tough, and awkward&mdash;and you know you may not please everyone&mdash;to me, it became more rewarding in the end.LG:OK, so you mentioned that as a child you had a passing encounter with Charles Manson, which helped inspireEyes Wide Open. Say what?AG:Okay. I go back and forth on this.Eyes Wide Openisn't a book about Manson, or even a Manson-like character, though a cultish figure is a chilling detail in the book. My dad moved out to L.A. in the &rsquo;60s and my older brother, a wayward spirit trying to become a musician, was out there as well, and, uh, took up residence on the Spahn Ranch, where Manson lived. At that time, Charlie was also trying to get his music produced. The two of them came up to my father's place one day and tried to sell him on anteing up for a demo. Manson was gaunt, quiet, creepy&mdash;and yes, he had those dark eyes. Though, at that time, Charlie Manson hadn't become the infamous &ldquo;Charles Manson&rdquo; yet! The scene eventually turned ugly&mdash;which I describe in the book&mdash;and they left, humiliated and angry. For years, my dad always insisted that the clan went up into the canyons that night looking to pay him back for what took place, but got lost in the L.A. hills and ended up at Sharon Tate&rsquo;s. Truth was, by that time my brother was long gone and, of course, there were other reasons the Manson clan ended up at Sharon Tate&rsquo;s house. But it makes a chilling scene!LG:Having followed your novels sinceThe Dark Tide, I&rsquo;ve noticed that you&rsquo;re drawn to stories involving complex family dynamics. What is it about this theme that resonates so strongly for you, and how has your own experience as a father influenced your writing?AG:I don't like writing straight-up thrillers. I like writing about families hurled into crisis and danger&mdash;soccer moms and regular dads and husbands who might have to rescue their daughters or who are, say, hedge fund managers and have one foot on the sidelines watching their kids and the other in nefarious cover-ups and conspiracies. These are the &ldquo;real life&rdquo; stories that intrigue me and provide the basis for the emotional complexity I&rsquo;m looking for. As for being a dad, it makes you know exactly what you would do&mdash;basically anything&mdash;to save your own family. And how creepy and evil one has to be to betray theirs!LG:One thriller writer to another, what draws you to suspense&mdash;and what&rsquo;s your favorite thing about thrillers?AG:You know what, Lisa, you can make a strong case that thriller writing is the single most relevant genre of fiction being written today, because it reflects the conflicts and crises and stories that we read every day in the news and that shape our world. The people who come to our craft aren&rsquo;t just graduate students, or MFA candidates or teachers, but CIA agents and journalists and doctors and lawyers whose experiences in life inform their work. As for suspense, I like to write books that draw you into the hero&rsquo;s plight from the opening pages, where people put their lives on the line for something&mdash;a belief, a family member, the truth. I&rsquo;m actually more into heroism than evil&mdash;but it's hard to have one without the other and when their arcs meet and they clash... well, there's suspense!LG:Without giving too much away, what&rsquo;s your favorite scene inEyes Wide Open?AG:Well, there are many, because the characters are based on people I know. But without doubt, one of the best involves my everyman hero, Jay Erlich, a doctor from Westchester who puts his successful life on hold and his life on the line to find the truth behind his nephew's suicide. Erlich goes to the super-max Pelican Bay Prison to see the long incarcerated Manson-like murderer, Russell Hovnanian. And the thing that makes that scene really creepy, and made hard to write, was that to be credible, this character, Hovnanian, had to be smarter than my hero, smarter than the very smart detective who accompanies him, even smarter than the reader! Oh yeah, the author too. But when it's pulled off, as I hope I did, it's a killer scene.LG:You wrote sixNew York Timesbestsellers with James Patterson. Dish. What was it like to work with Jim, and how much more fun is it to control everything yourself?AG:Such good questions. Are you a writer, too? Oh, wait.  Never mind.Ha! Jim and I got along fine; he's an amazing idea guy, his instincts for plot are finely honed, and I think he might even say himself that he's a sharper editor than a writer. I always describe working with him as an MFA and MBA course in thriller management rolled into one. I learned a lot of things about how to craft a thriller that would have taken years to learn on my own&mdash;and how to put them in my own style. I&rsquo;m honestly proud of the six books we did together, all of which went to number one. But yes, I&rsquo;m kind of a control guy&mdash;how did you know?To his credit, Jim let me have a substantial share of control on the books we did&mdash;probably a lot more than I would have. He&rsquo;s a much more evolved manager than me! And all these books later, I still kind of miss him, calling him up, running a plot idea by him. I mean, is there a better person in the world to bounce an idea off of? But I also like it when the checks are made out solely to me!LG:Now tell me the truth. What is your least favorite part of writing&mdash;and you can only choose one.AG:Easy&mdash;this is becoming a bit of a running theme here&mdash;loss of control! You shape your baby from the initial birth of an idea, live with it daily, watch it grow like a child into a fully dimensional being. You feel you know it better than anybody. Then you turn it over and put it out into the world and between the cover, the marketing, the presentation at retail and the sales, it all takes place without you being able to control its destiny a single lick! And by that time, you're already halfway into the next one anyway!LG:Finally, what do you want readers to take away from readingEyes Wide Open&mdash;and congrats on another great novel!AG:Thanks, Lisa. What I would have them take away is thatEyes Wide Openis not only a thrilling read, it's also an engrossing, emotional family story&mdash;about a family with a dark history and the lengths it will go to protect that secret. It&rsquo;s also about two brothers, one wayward, the other successful, and how they try to bridge the gap that tore them apart. It reads like a personal memoir chock-full of thrills. And it&rsquo;s my family story.So great to be with you today! I was a big fan ofLove You More. It&rsquo;s been a lot of fun!",

        "B00005ULXN": "Sega's mascot made his 3-D debut on the Dreamcast, but with the demise  of that system the zippy blue hedgehog is popping up everywhere--including on  the GameCube. Unfortunately, his first next-gen appearance,Sonic Adventure  2: Battle, is marred by the same 3-D camera problems that plagued the  Dreamcast version, and the multiplayer \"battle\" component isn't all that it's  cracked up to be.Right out of the gate, players have the option of choosing Hero (Sonic, Tails,  and Knuckles) or Dark (Dr. Eggman, Shadow, and Rouge) quests, which are  completely different. Sonic and his dark counterpart Shadow traverse levels at  warp speed colleting coins and power-ups while fighting enemies in the game's  most exhilarating moments. Unfortunately, the other characters are nowhere near  as fun to play. Dr. Eggman and Tails fight through levels that require little  more than constant button-mashing to shoot an endless procession of enemies, and  Knuckles and Rouge participate in seemingly endless levels that require  searching for a variety of objects.Graphically, the game is a bit of a letdown considering the processing muscle of  GameCube. Models are fairly simplistic, and level textures are sometimes bland.  Game Boy Advance owners can use a link cable to download Chao from the game and  train them on the go, but the rewards for doing so are minor considering the  time investment involved. The main feature this game offers over its Dreamcast  predecessor is the variety of multiplayer modes, which are fun but offer none of  the depth or replayability of standalone multiplayer games likeSuper Smash  Bros. Melee. Still, they are nice additions--especially the racing  games--and round out a flawed single-player component. Sonic addicts who missed this  game the first time around on the Dreamcast will definitely want to check it  out, but the finicky camera, tedious non-Sonic/Shadow levels in single-player  mode, and surprisingly shallow multiplayer components (especially the Chao  games) turn what could have been a great game into a mere good one.--T. Byrl  BakerPros:Plenty of varietySonic/Shadow levels are pure, unadulterated funCons:Knuckles/Rouge levels are tediousMultiplayer aspects could use some more depth",
        "0099766817": "In search of missing family members, Zulu priest Stephen Kumalo leaves his South African village to traverse the deep and perplexing city of Johannesburg in the 1940s. With his sister turned prostitute, his brother turned labor protestor and his son, Absalom, arrested for the murder of a white man, Kumalo must grapple with how to bring his family back from the brink of destruction as the racial tension throughout Johannesburg hampers his attempts to protect his family. With a deep yet gentle voice rounded out by his English accent, Michael York captures the tone and energy of this novel. His rhythmic narration proves hypnotizing. From the fierce love of Kumalo to the persuasive rhetoric of Kumalo's brother and the solemn regret of Absalom, York injects soul into characters tempered by their socioeconomic status as black South Africans.(May)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "006087600X": "The diaries our 40th president kept while in office&mdash;edited and abridged by historian Brinkley (The Great Deluge)&mdash;are largely a straightforward political chronicle. Reagan describes meetings with heads of state and antiabortion leaders, reflects on legislative strategy and worries about leaks to the press. He often used his diary to vigorously defend his polices: for example, after a 1984 visit with South African archbishop Desmond Tutu (whom Reagan calls \"na&iuml;ve\"), the president explained why his approach to apartheid&mdash;\"quiet diplomacy\"&mdash;was preferable to sanctions. Reagan sometimes seems uncomfortable with dissent, as when he is irked by a high school student who presents a petition advocating a nuclear freeze. And he often sees the media as a \"lynch mob,\" trying to drum up scandal where there is none. Reagan's geniality shines through in his more quotidian comments: he muses regularly about how much he appreciates Nancy, and his complaints about hating Monday mornings make him seem quite like everyone else. Brinkley doesn't weigh down the text with extensive annotation; this makes for smooth reading, but those who don't remember the major political events of the 1980s will want to refer to the glossary of names. Reagan's diaries are revealing, and Brinkley has done historians and the broad public a great service by editing them for publication.(May 22)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Four years later, the president of the U.S. begins acting strangely, and an enemy begins to plot an overthrow. The murder of a Cambridge professor and the growing threat of war between the U.S. and China have the world on edge. An incident in the South China Sea gets Alex Hawke involved, and he will not stop until he can end the madness, even if it means sneaking into China and staging an impossible rescue. Hawke is one of those heroes whose arrogance makes him a bit hard to admire, but he clearly wears a white hat. The sheer scope of this high-concept thriller, and the well-placed shocks throughout, make it Bell&#x2019;s best effort to date. A perfect tale for fans of plot-driven action-adventure and, especially, for the Cussler crowd. --Jeff Ayers",

        "0060825316": "Russian emigr&eacute; Marina Buriakov, 82, is preparing for her granddaughter's wedding near Seattle while fighting a losing battle against Alzheimer's. Stuggling to remember whom Katie is marrying (and indeed that there is to be a marriage at all), Marina does remember her youth as a Hermitage Museum docent as the siege of Leningrad began; it is into these memories that she disappears. After frantic packing, the Hermitage's collection is transported to a safe hiding place until the end of the war. The museum staff and their families remain, wintering (all 2,000 of them) in the Hermitage basement to avoid bombs and marauding soldiers. Marina, using the technique of a fellow docent, memorizes favorite Hermitage works; these memories, beautifully interspersed, are especially vibrant. Dean, making her debut, weaves Marina's past and present together effortlessly. The dialogue around Marina's forgetfulness is extremely well done, and the Hermitage material has depth. Although none of the characters emerges particularly vividly (Marina included), memory, the hopes one pins on it and the letting go one must do around it all take on real poignancy, giving the story a satisfying fullness.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Sophie Honeywell hasn't heard from ex-boyfriend Thomas Gordon since she broke his heart three years ago. He's since married and fathered a child, while Sophie remains single, pining for a baby. When Thomas's Aunt Connie leaves her house on Scribbly Gum Island to Sophie, the family is largely nonplussed&mdash;but then, they're used to mysteries.

Among the large, eccentric family, Sophie starts a new life, befriending Thomas's cousin Grace, who is suffering through postpartum depression; finding a dangerous mutual attraction with Grace's husband, Callum; and dealing with bitter, intense Veronika, Thomas's sister, who covets Connie's house. Moriarty expertly handles a large cast and their relationships, keeping everyone guessing as the true story of baby Enigma&mdash;and its role in Sophie's strange inheritance&mdash;is slowly revealed.

In mere decades this race has ripped apart populations across Asia and Europe and by 1951 has landed on the shores of England.

Humanity&#x2552;s hope for survival is slim, and the tide of the battle rests on the shoulders of U.S. Army Ranger, Sgt. Nathan Hale.The Chimera didn't plan to take this protracted war lying down, however, and amassed their forces in Russia. Once Russia was captured, they quickly erected a wall around the former country, rebuking all efforts at communication or contact. While the world waited and wondered what other terrors might spill from the wall, England prepares for and falls to a major Chimera invasion in 1951.The United States comes to aid their English allies, but all does not go as planned. The next three days will see some of the most intense fighting the war has known thus far, and it's up to you to end the Chimera threat before the plague of defeat can encircle the globe.Next-generation gameplay and styleThe gameplay of Resistance is classic First Person Shooter. Insomniac Games has combined its passion for creating exotic weapons and vehicles with a proprietary physics system to create unique human and alien weaponry. Many of the weapons of the game are era-appropriate, such as pistols and grenades. Other weapons, such as the Chimeran Auger, are of alien design. Due to the differences in the ways that the various weapons handle, great care must be taken when entering an area infested with Chimera with their own weaponry. In addition to the obvious array of weapons, players can use melee attacks and jump to avoid attack.Special game actions, called \"Skill Tasks,\" are worth set number of points that can be spent to unlock new content in the game. A Skill Task may be something as simple as killing a number of enemies in a short period of time or as involved as locating a hidden area in the single player campaign. The mystery of the tasks, however, is that they aren't actually revealed until you have completed the task. This makes for a great reply incentive, as you will be mowing down Chimera and be suddenly rewarded with task points, often when you least expect the reward.Obviously, presentation is one of the areas in which Resistance shines. The frame rate is silky-smooth, and never seems to get bogged down when there is a large number of Chimera or teammates on screen. Animations are believable, the locations are detailed, and the voice acting is top-notch. Explosions are especially impressive, sending shrapnel and smoke in all directions. If you're looking for a game to impress your friends with graphically, look no further. Resistance is the type of game that makes you feel confident about the future of the PLAYSTATION 3.Track stats and more onlineResistance also boasts an impressive 40 player online multiplayer mode.

        "0061348104": "The story of the ill-fated Donner party, a group of nineteenth-century settlers en route to California who became snowbound in the Sierra Nevada mountains and resorted to cannibalism to survive, remains an iconic moment in American history. Given the story&#x2019;s inherent elements of horror and heroism, it is surprising that this account, told from the point of view of a young bride who survived the tragedy, is finally such an uninteresting book. Part of the problem is the author&#x2019;s inability of incorporate his copious background material into the flow of the narrative (readers probably don&#x2019;t need to know about 1840s-era birth-control methods). Even the author&#x2019;s treatment of the tragedy itself, however, feels dully reportorial, without any of the you-are-there drama that Piers Paul Reid brough to Alive!, his account of history&#x2019;s second-most-famous cannibalism-survival story, concerning the famous 1972 airplane crash in the Andes. So why bother with this Donner party treatment when so many other, more compelling works exist? The premise itself sets this book apart, and while it&#x2019;s not handled particularly effectively, it will still interest those fascinated by the subject. --David Pitt",

Little more than twenty years later, Danny is the CEO of one of the world's most dynamic restaurant organizations, which includes 11 unique dining establishments, each at the top of its game. How has he done it? How has he consistently beaten the odds and set the competitive bar in one of the toughest trades around?In this landmark book, Danny shares the lessons he's learned while developing the winning recipe for doing the business he calls \"enlightened hospitality.\" This innovative philosophy emphasizes putting the power of hospitality to work in a new and counterintuitive way: The first and most important application of hospitality is to the people who work for you, and then, in descending order of priority, to the guests, the community, the suppliers, and the investors.

        "0060598964": "In this unique biography of Thomas Jefferson, leading journalist and social critic Christopher Hitchens offers a startlingly new and provocative interpretation of our Founding Father. Situating Jefferson within the context of America's evolution and tracing his legacy over the past two hundred years, Hitchens brings the character of Jefferson to life as a man of his time and also as a symbolic figure beyond it.Conflicted by power, Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence and acted as Minister to France yet yearned for a quieter career in the Virginia legislature. Predicting that slavery would shape the future of America's development, this professed proponent of emancipation elided the issue in the Declaration and continued to own human property. An eloquent writer, he was an awkward public speaker; a reluctant candidate, he left an indelible presidential legacy.Jefferson's statesmanship enabled him to negotiate the Louisiana Purchase with France, doubling the size of the nation, and he authorized the Lewis and Clark expedition, opening up the American frontier for exploration and settlement. Hitchens also analyzes Jefferson's handling of the Barbary War, a lesser-known chapter of his political career, when his attempt to end the kidnapping and bribery of Americans by the Barbary states, and the subsequent war with Tripoli, led to the building of the U.S. navy and the fortification of America's reputation regarding national defense.In the background of this sophisticated analysis is a large historical drama: the fledgling nation's struggle for independence, formed in the crucible of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment, and, in its shadow, the deformation of that struggle in the excesses of the French Revolution. This artful portrait of a formative figure and a turbulent era poses a challenge to anyone interested in American history -- or in the ambiguities of human nature.Discover More Eminent LivesFrancis Crick: Discoverer of the Genetic Codeby Matt RidleyFreud: Inventor of the Modern Mindby Peter KramerMachiavelli: Philosopher of Powerby Ross KingMuhammad: A Prophet for Our Timeby Karen ArmstrongGeorge Washington: The Founding Fatherby Paul JohnsonAlexis de Tocqueville: Democracy's Guideby Joseph Epstein",

I&rsquo;m in the drama business. So in plotting the book, I decided to tell stories of my younger years and turn my own life into drama.  What these stories have in common is that they were all formative moments, leading me to become the actor that I am today. Hence the subtitle: an actor&rsquo;s education.Q:  Early in the book you write, &ldquo;acting is nothing more than storytelling.&rdquo; How do the two compare?Lithgow:  An actor is a storyteller all right, but he only plays a part. He is a single character in a larger drama, like an essential cog in a complex machine.  A storyteller is in charge of the whole event &ndash; like a playwright. Where would an actor be without a play?Q:  InDrama, you admit that in your youth, you &ldquo;had no intention of being an actor.&rdquo; All these years later, could you imagine any other life?Lithgow:  No, I&rsquo;ve long ago embraced my destiny as an actor. My great lost ambition was to be a painter, and I suppose I could have been a good one.  But early on, acting won out.Q:  While it offers an inside glimpse of your life and career,Dramais also a tribute to your father. Tell us a little about the man readers will meet in the pages of the memoir. What was the most important lesson you learned from him?Lithgow:  My father was a pioneer in the American regional theater movement and remains one of the very few Americans to produce every single one of Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays. He was a delightful, creative, and complicated man. He headed up our family of six, and because of his quixotic ventures, we led a gypsy-like existence while I was growing up, moving about ten times.  What important lessons did I learn from him?  Far more than I can list here. You could fill a book with them.  And I did.Q:  What do you consider to be your biggest successes, both professionally and personally?Lithgow:  My biggest professional success? That&rsquo;s a hard one. I guess the simplest answer is achieving a career where I can move easily between movies, television, and the stage, and from comedy to tragedy to horror. As for my biggest personal success, it&rsquo;s my family and sporadically achieving the elusive goal of a happy life.Q:  Could you ever see yourself scaling back your stage and screen career and becoming a teacher like your father, inspiring a new generation of aspiring actors?Lithgow:  Not really. I remain too busy acting and too full of self-doubt to present myself as an expert on anything. If I aspire to anything as a teacher, it would be to teach by example.Q:  You have said that &ldquo;it is far more interesting for a reader to read an actor&rsquo;s backstage history of struggle, crisis, and discovery, out of the public eye, than a conventional, self-congratulatory rehashing of his &lsquo;big moments.&rsquo;&rdquo; what are the lessons inherent in that &ldquo;history of struggle, crisis, and discovery&rdquo;?Lithgow:  We actors (and anyone else for that matter) learn much more about ourselves from failure than from success. Indeed, success in my business can be a source of egregious self-importance, self-delusion, and sometimes self-destructiveness. Succeed by all means, but remember your failures.Q:  What would you like readers to take away from readingDrama?Lithgow:  I hope that readers will find my memoir to be surprising and entertaining, and find the people and events in my life as fascinating as I find them.  But I also hope that the book provokes some thought about this curious business I&rsquo;m in. Why are actors driven to act? Why does everyone want to gather round and watch?  What is this strange transaction between the entertainer and the entertained? And why can none of us do without it?A Look InsideDramaClick on the images below to open larger versions.",

First taken as a slave along with his less intrepid brother, Eli assimilates himself into Comanche culture, learning their arts of riding, hunting, and total warfare. When the tribe succumbs to waves of disease and settlers, Eli's only option is a return to Texas, where his acquired thirsts for freedom and self-determination set a course for his family's inexorable rise through the industries of cattle and oil.The Sonis Philipp Meyer's epic tale of more than 150 years of money, family, and power, told through the memories of three unforgettable narrators: Eli, now 100 and known simply as \"the Colonel\"; Eli's son Peter, called \"the great disappointment\" for his failure to meet the family&rsquo;s vision of itself; and Eli's great-granddaughter Jeanne Anne, who struggles to maintain the McCullough empire in the economic frontier of modern Texas. The book is long but never dull&mdash;Meyer's gift (and obsession) for historical detail and vernacular is revelatory, and the distinct voices of his fully fleshed-and-blooded characters drive the story. And let there be blood: some readers will flinch at Meyer's blunt (and often mesmerizing) portrayal of violence in mid-19th century Texas, but it&rsquo;s never gratuitous. His first novel, 2009'sAmerican Rust, drew praise for its stark and original characterization of post-industrial America, but Meyer has outdone himself withThe Son, as ambitious a book as any you&rsquo;ll read this year--or any year.

This is what happened to Sebastian Junger, and only a small part of what he recounts inA Death in Belmont.The quiet suburb of Belmont, Massacuusetts, is in the grip of fear. The Boston Strangler murders have taken place nearby, and now there is another shocking sex crime, right in Belmont. The victim is Bessie Goldberg, a middle-aged woman who had hired a cleaning man to help out around the house on that fall day in 1963. He is a black man named Roy Smith.  He did the appointed chores, collected his money and left a receipt on the kitchen table.  Neighbors will say that he looked furtive when he walked down the street, that he was in a hurry, that he stopped to buy cigarettes, that he looked over his shoulder.  They didn't see a black man in Belmont very often, so, of course, they noticed him. So the story went, and on these slender threads, and his own checkered history, Roy Smith is convicted of the Belmont murder and sent to prison.On the day of the murder, Albert DeSalvo, an Italian-American handyman, is also in Belmont, working as a carpenter in the Junger home, where the picture is taken. Two years after his work for the Jungers, he confesses in vivid detail to the crimes of which the Boston Strangler is accused, and sent to prison, where he is stabbed to death by an inmate.  But he never confesses to the Bessie Goldberg murder.  Could he have left the Junger home, committed the murder a few blocks away and calmly returned to finish his day's work?  Could Roy Smith really have been the guilty party, even though his sentence was commuted after De Salvo confessed?In the grand tradition of his bestsellingThe Perfect Storm, Junger tells a terrific story, lining up all the elements, asking all the pertinent questions, digging into the backgrounds of both men, retelling his mother's very strange encounter with Albert when she is home alone with Sebastian.  He then asks the larger questions:  Was Roy Smith convicted summarily because he was black?  Was Albert De Salvo really the Boston Strangler?Junger cannot answer all the questions, as no one can.  Without DNA, there is no way to be certain of which of the two men might have committed the rape and murder of Bessie Goldberg, or if neither of them is guilty.  While it is frustrating not to know for sure, the story is fascinating, reads like a tautly plotted mystery thriller, and Junger's close connection is downright creepy.--Valerie Ryan--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

Twenty years later, she is a noted journalist, a mother and divorcee. At a low point in her career, just as her daughter has left to spend the summer in California, Mike hears from her sister DeeDee, who writes asking for help with their dying father. In a particularly vulnerable state, Mike goes home. Brittle and sharp-edged, repelled by DeeDee's transformation into a mountainous caricature of would-be gentility, unmoved by her father's battle to stop the Department of Transportation from building a highway through his parents' farm, the \"homeplace\" that has never meant much to her, she intends to stay only a few weeks. But she is caught up in a passionate affair with Bayard Sewell, a shining figure in the local political firmament whom she had loved as a girl. On a trip to the farm with her father and the Bible-quoting, rough-edged lawyer who is his only supporter, Mike begins to understand the old man's attachment to the land and reluctantly agrees to join the fight. In the process she finally plumbs the depths of her own anger and falseness, finding resources of compassion and strength. About love and death, greed and passion, the pull of family and the push of self, Homeplace is a deeply moving story of a fierce and necessary forgiveness.

Liv is dead and Aria's recovering from a disabling gunshot wound. Roar and Perry blame each other for Liv's death and it's tearing them apart. The magnetic Aether storms are getting worse. Before it's too late, they must find the Still Blue, a paradise where they can live safe from the storms. Sable, the ruthless and cruel Horn tribe leader, kidnaps Cinder to use his ability to generate an Aether to destroy the Aether currents. Perry, Aria, and the others determine to rescue Cinder, knowing that a showdown between rival tribe leaders Sable and Hess, the cowardly Dweller leader, is inevitable. Perry and Aria are strong yet imperfect characters struggling to balance their love for each other with their responsibilities as tribe leaders. Some of the book's most interesting characters, such as Liv and Cinder, aren't fully developed and are, sadly, short-lived. The inclusion of the identity of Aria's father, while not essential to the story, is a nice surprise. The humorous quips made by Roar and the 6, so welcome in the series' previous books, are largely missing here. The fact that Perry, Aria, and company are repeatedly captured by Sable does become a bit repetitive. Still, the forthright and compelling plot has just enough of a twist to make this book, and the series, stand out from others like it.

He was a pale boy, underweight and sickly. His grandmother, intent on fattening him, sat across from him while he ate his soup, entertaining him by spinning a yarn.Abubbeh meiseh, a \"grandmother&rsquo;s story.\" A fairy tale. A legend.\"He was the son of a Polish nobleman. And his name was Jusef Sardu. Master Sardu stood taller than any other man. Taller than any roof in the village. He had to bow deeply to enter any door. But his great height, it was a burden. A disease of birth, not a blessing. The young man suffered. His muscles lacked the strength to support his long, heavy bones. At times it was a struggle for him just to walk. He used a cane, a tall stick--taller than you--with a silver handle carved into the shape of a wolf&rsquo;s head, which was the family crest.\"\"Yes, Bubbeh?\" said Abraham, between spoonfuls.\"This was his lot in life, and it taught him humility, which is a rare thing indeed for a nobleman to possess. He had so much compassion-- for the poor, for the hardworking, for the sick. He was especially dear to the children of the village, and his great, deep pockets--the size of turnip sacks--bulged with trinkets and sweets. He had not much of a childhood himself, matching his father&rsquo;s height at the age of eight, and surpassing him by a head at age nine. His frailty and his great size were a secret source of shame to his father. But Master Sardu truly was a gentle giant, and much beloved by his people. It was said of him that Master Sardu looked down on everyone, yet looked down on no one.\"She nodded at him, reminding him to take another spoonful. He chewed a boiled red beet, known as a \"baby heart\" because of its color, its shape, its capillary-like strings. \"Yes, Bubbeh?\"\"He was also a lover of nature, and had no interest in the brutality of the hunt--but, as a nobleman and a man of rank, at the age of fifteen his father and his uncles prevailed upon him to accompany them on a six-week expedition to Romania.\"\"To here, Bubbeh?\" said Abraham. \"The giant, he came here?\"\"To the north country,kaddishel.

Sardu family lore said that eating wolf meat gave Sardu men courage and strength, and the young master&rsquo;s father believed that this might cure his son&rsquo;s weak muscles.\"\"Yes, Bubbeh?\"\"Their trek was long and arduous, as well as violently opposed by the weather, and Jusef struggled mightily. He had never before traveled anywhere outside his family&rsquo;s village, and the looks he received from strangers along the journey shamed him. When they arrived in the dark forest, the woodlands felt alive around him. Packs of animals roamed the woods at night, almost like refugees displaced from their shelters, their dens, nests, and lairs. So many animals that the hunters were unable to sleep at night in their camp. Some wanted to leave, but the elder Sardu&rsquo;s obsession came before all else. They could hear the wolves, crying in the night, and he wanted one badly for his son, his only son, whose gigantism was a pox upon the Sardu line. He wanted to cleanse the house of Sardu of this curse, to marry off his son, and produce many healthy heirs.\"And so it was that his father, off tracking a wolf, was the first to become separated from the others, just before nightfall on the second evening. The rest waited for him all night, and spread out to search for him after sunrise. And so it was that one of Jusef&rsquo;s cousins failed to return that evening. And so on, you see.\"\"Yes, Bubbeh?\"\"Until the only one left was Jusef, the boy giant. That next day he set out, and in an area previously searched, discovered the body of his father, and of all his cousins and uncles, laid out at the entrance to an underground cave. Their skulls had been crushed with great force, but their bodies remained uneaten--killed by a beast of tremendous strength, yet not out of hunger or fear. For what reason, he could not guess&mdash;though he did feel himself being watched, perhaps even studied, by some being lurking within that dark cave.\"Master Sardu carried each body away from the cave and buried them deep. Of course, this exertion severely weakened him, taking most of his strength. He was spent, he wasfarmutshet. And yet, alone and scared and exhausted, he returned to the cave that night, to face what evil revealed itself after dark, to avenge his forebears or die trying. This is known from a diary he kept, discovered in the woods many years later. This was his last entry.\"Continue   ReadingThe Strain",

        "006112429X": "A number of fictional attempts have been made to portray what might lead a teenager to kill a number of schoolmates or teachers, Columbine style, but Shriver's is the most triumphantly accomplished by far. A gifted journalist as well as the author of seven novels, she  brings to her story a keen understanding of the intricacies of marital and parental relationships as well as a narrative pace that is both compelling and thoughtful. Eva Khatchadourian is a smart, skeptical New Yorker whose impulsive marriage to Franklin, a much more conventional person, bears fruit, to her surprise and confessed disquiet, in baby Kevin. From the start Eva is ambivalent about him, never sure if she really wanted a child, and he is balefully hostile toward her; only good-old-boy Franklin, hoping for the best, manages to overlook his son's faults as he grows older, a largely silent, cynical, often malevolent child. The later birth of a sister who is his opposite in every way, deeply affectionate and fragile, does nothing to help, and Eva always suspects his role in an accident that befalls little Celia. The narrative, which leads with quickening and horrifying inevitability to the moment when Kevin massacres seven of his schoolmates and a teacher at his upstate New York high school, is told as a series of letters from Eva to an apparently estranged Franklin, after Kevin has been put in a prison for juvenile offenders. This seems a gimmicky way to tell the story, but is in fact surprisingly effective in its picture of an affectionate couple who are poles apart, and enables Shriver to pull off a huge and crushing shock far into her tale. It's a harrowing, psychologically astute, sometimes even darkly humorous novel, with a clear-eyed, hard-won ending and a tough-minded sense of the difficult, often painful human enterprise.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to theHardcoveredition.",

        "0061015733": "Amazon.com Exclusive ContentA Michael Crichton TimelineAmazon.com reveals a few facts about the \"father of the techno-thriller.\"1942:John Michael Crichton is born in Chicago, Illinois on Oct. 23.1960:Crichton graduates from Roslyn High School on Long Island, New York, with high marks and a reputation as a star basketball player. He decides to attend Harvard University to study English. During his studies, he rankles under his writing professors' criticism. As an act of rebellion, Crichton submits an essay by George Orwell as his own. The professor doesn&#x92;t catch the plagiarism and gives Orwell a B-. This experience convinces Crichton to change his field of study to anthropology.1964:Crichton graduates summa cum laude from Harvard University in anthropology. After studying further as a visiting lecturer at Cambridge University and receiving the Henry Russell Shaw Travelling Fellowship, which allowed him to travel in Europe and North Africa, Crichton begins coursework at the Harvard School of Medicine. To help fund his medical endeavors, he writes spy thrillers under several pen names. One of these works,A Case of Need, wins the 1968 Mystery Writers of America's Edgar Allan Poe Award.1969:Crichton graduates from Harvard Medical school and is accepted as a post-doctoral fellow at the Salk Institute for Biological Science in La Jolla, Calif. However, his career in medicine is waylaid by the publication of the first novel under his own name,The Andromeda Strain. The novel, about an apocalyptic plague, climbs high on bestseller lists and is later made into apopular film. Crichton said of his decision to pursue writing full time: \"To quit medicine to become a writer struck most people like quitting the Supreme Court to become a bail bondsman.\"1972:Crichton's second novel under his own nameThe Terminal Man, is published. Also, two of Crichton's previous works under his pen names,DealingandA Case of Needare made into movies. After watching the filming, Crichton decides to try his hand at directing. He will eventually direct seven films including the 1973 science-fiction hitWestworld, which was the first film ever to use computer-generated effects.1980:Crichton draws on his anthropology background and fascination with new technology to createCongo, a best-selling novel about a search for industrial diamonds and a new race of gorillas. The novel, patterned after the adventure writings of H. Ryder Haggard, updates the genre with the inclusion of high-tech gadgets that, although may seem quaint 20 years later, serve to set Crichton's work apart and he begins to cement his reputation as \"the father of the techno-thriller.\"1990:After the 1980s, which saw the publication of the underwater adventureSphere(1987) and an invitation to become a visiting writer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1988), Crichton begins the new decade with a bang via the publication of his most popular novel,Jurassic Park. The book is a powerful example of Crichton's use of science and technology as the bedrock for his work. Heady discussion of genetic engineering, chaos theory, and paleontology run throughout the tightly-wound thriller that strands a crew of scientists on an island populated by cloned dinosaurs run amok. The novel inspires the 1993Steven Spielberg film, and together book and film will re-ignite the world&#x92;s fascination with dinosaurs.1995:Crichton resurrects an idea from his medical school days to create the Emmy-Award Winning television seriesER. In this year,ERwon eight Emmys and Crichton received an award from the Producers Guild of America in the category of outstanding multi-episodic series. Set in an insanely busy an often dangerous Chicago emergency room, the fast-paced drama is defined by Crichton's now trademark use of technical expertise and insider jargon. The year also saw the publication ofThe Lost Worldreturning readers to the dinosaur-infested island.2000:In recognition for Crichton's contribution in popularizing paleontology, a dinosaur discovered in southern China is named after him. \"Crichton's ankylosaur\" is a small, armored plant-eating dinosaur that dates to the early Jurassic Period, about 180 million years ago. \"For a person like me, this is much better than an Academy Award,\" Crichton said of the honor.2004:Crichton&#x92;s newest thrillerState of Fearis published.Amazon.com's Significant SevenMichael Crichton kindly agreed to take the life quiz we like to give to all our authors: the Amazon.com Significant Seven.Q:What book has had the most significant impact on your life?A:Prisoners of Childhoodby Alice MillerQ:You are stranded on a desert island with only one book, one CD, and one DVD--what are they?A:Tao Te Chingby Lao Tzu (Witter Bynner version)Symphony #2 in D Majorby Johannes Brahms (Georg Solti)Ikiruby Akira KurosawaQ:What is the worst lie you've ever told?A:Surely you're joking.Q:Describe the perfect writing environment.A:Small room.

When they try to force her to do so, she rebels, mainly because they tell her she must do it. She formerly worked for the International Paranormal Containment Agency (IPCA), and they apparently forced her to do things she did not want to do. Confused? For readers who are new to the story, it feels as though there is a secret club of vocabulary and references to previous events. The story is episodic, with Evie repeatedly making the same mistakes, and with her near-misses neatly resolved. However, the first two books have been popular and there will be demand from those readers for this book. It is a clean paranormal romance-Evie even says (somewhat annoyingly) \"BLEEP\" instead of any swear words, and the sex factor is very low, with only a bit of touching and a few stolen kisses.

Years ago, his cheating drove Mariah to attempt suicide and Colin had her briefly committed to an institution. Now Mariah's facing divorce and again fighting depression, when her eight-year-old daughter, Faith, suddenly acquires an imaginary friend. Soon this friend is telling the girl how to bring her grandmother back from the dead and how to cure a baby dying of AIDS. As Faith manifests stigmata, doctors are astounded, and religious controversy ensues, in part because Faith insists that God is a woman. An alarmed Colin sues for custody of Faith, and the fear of losing her daughter dramatically changes meek, diffident Mariah into a strong, protective and brave womanAone who fights for her daughter, holds her own against doctors and lawyers and finds the confidence to pursue a surprising new romance with TV atheist Ian Fletcher, cynical \"Spokesman of the Millennium Generation.\" Though the novel feels a bit long, Picoult's pacing stabilizes the increasingly complicated plot, and the final chapters, in which Mariah fights for Faith's custody in court, are riveting. The mother-daughter relationship is all the more powerful for being buffeted by the exploitative and ethically questionable domains of medicine, media, law and religion; these characters' many triumphant transformations are Picoult's triumphs as well.

        "0060628391": "When Richard Foster began writingCelebration of Disciplinemore than 20 years ago, an older writer gave him a bit of advice: \"Be sure that every chapter forces the reader into the next chapter.\" Foster took the advice to heart; as a result, his book presents one of the most compelling and readable visions of Christian spirituality published in the past few decades. After beginning with a simple observation--\"Superficiality is the curse of our age.... The desperate need today is not for a greater number of intelligent people, or gifted people, but for deep people\"--Foster's book moves to explain the disciplines people must cultivate in order to achieve spiritual depth. In succinct, urgent, and sometimes humorous chapters, Foster defines a broad range of classic spiritual disciplines in terms that are lucid without being too limiting and offers advice that's practical without being overly prescriptive. For instance, after describing meditation as a combination of \"intense intimacy and awful reverence,\" he settles into such down-to-earth topics as how to choose a place and a posture in which to meditate.Perhaps most interesting and useful is Foster's chapter on the controversial Christian discipline of submission. According to Foster, submission does not demand self-hatred or loss of identity. Instead, it simply means growing secure in the conviction that \"our happiness is not dependent on getting what we want\" but on the fulfillment that naturally flows from love of one's neighbors. Such wise and encouraging suggestions have helped many readers to discard the idea that discipline is an onerous duty and to move toward a liberating and simpler idea of discipline--whose defining character, as Foster never forgets, is joy.--Michael Joseph Gross",

        "006135323X": "Irrational behavior is a part of human nature, but as MIT professor Ariely has discovered in 20 years of researching behavioral economics, people tend to behave irrationally in a predictable fashion. Drawing on psychology and economics, behavioral economics can show us why cautious people make poor decisions about sex when aroused, why patients get greater relief from a more expensive drug over its cheaper counterpart and why honest people may steal office supplies or communal food, but not money. According to Ariely, our understanding of economics, now based on the assumption of a rational subject, should, in fact, be based on our systematic, unsurprising irrationality. Ariely argues that greater understanding of previously ignored or misunderstood forces (emotions, relativity and social norms) that influence our economic behavior brings a variety of opportunities for reexamining individual motivation and consumer choice, as well as economic and educational policy.

This new Rayman game features the funniest, zaniest, wackiest antics ever when hordes of nasty bunnies invade Rayman's world. They enslave him, forcing Rayman to participate in a series of gladiator-like trials. In order to win his freedom, Rayman must entertain and outwit these crazed, out-of-control bunnies.Beat the bad bunnies and become a superstar!Unlock mini-games to play with friends.View larger.Innumerable uses for the Wii Remote allow for creative game modes.View larger.How many Raving Rabbids can you take out in 30 seconds?View larger.Multiplayer games are as fast as they are hilarious.View larger.Welcome to a new generation of RaymanYou'd be hard-pressed to find a game with as much character asRayman Raving Rabbids. From the creative minigames to the quirks of the bunnies, this game packs an immense amount of entertainment on one disc. It's rare in games that failing during a competition can bring you as much joy as actually succeeding, butRayman Raving Rabbidsdoes an admirable job of rewarding your failure with a large dose of comic screams, flying plungers and crossed eyes.Of course, the point is to succeed and not let the bunnies laugh at your failure.Rayman Raving Rabbidsmay have a lot of style but it has very little plot. Each level consists of four minigame challenges and one \"boss battle,\" so to speak. If you complete at least three of the minigames, the main gate opens, allowing you to take on a greater challenge. Once you play a minigame in the Story Mode, you unlock that minigame and can play it at any time and against friends.Exercise your Wii RemoteHand it to Ubisoft's development crew as they really took advantage of the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers' capabilities. Some minigames are as simple as twirling the Wii Remote like a lasso and pushing a button to launch a cow as if you were in a hammer throw competition. Some minigames really test your coordinating, asking you to swing the Nunchuk like a jump rope and flicking the Wii Remote up to make Rayman jump.Each level has one consistant challege, however: a rhythm game. As a song plays, the bunnies approach a spot on either stage left or right. When they hit that spot, you'll shake the Nunchuk (if the bunny is on the left) or the Wii Remote when the rabbid hits the mark.When you take on the boss stages, you'll find yourself, more often than not, playing a rail shooter. The Wii Remote becomes your light gun, firing plungers at the horde of oncoming rodents. When your plunger supply runs out, shake the Nunchuk to reload. In recent years, the rail shooter (where you don't control the movement) has been forsaken for the first-person shooter and free movement. The Rayman boss experience will make rail shooter fans rejoice. If other shooters can perform as well as the plunger-fueled firing action ofRayman Raving Rabbids, the genre will come back with a vengeance.Impressive replay valueThere's extra incentive to play the many minigames ofRayman Raving Rabbids. When you complete a game in Challenge Mode, the game gives you a code that you can enter at the Rayman Web site which basically gives you access to special features on the site.The minigames ofRayman Raving Rabbidsskew toward a younger audience, and at first, an above-average gamer should find the games to be pretty easy. However, once the minigames are unlocked, a big challenge awaits you to get the highest scores and blast your friends in multiplayer challenges. That's when the real party begins! Rayman delivers exactly what the Wii promises: fun and lots of it. Here's hoping the bunnies come back for multiple invasions!",
        "0061856436": "Amazon Exclusive: A Letter from Sarah SilvermanDear Reader:My name is Sarah Silverman.  I was once primarily known for saying the word \"poop\" and getting paid above market rates for it.  But those days are over, because I am now going to be known for having written a book.  Why did I write a book, you might wonder?  Because it just seemed like the right time to be getting into the publishing industry.I'm kidding.  Publishing is rotting like an abandoned possum carcass on the shoulder of I-95.  I know that for a fact, because shortly after my book deal was announced, I kept hearing people lament the imminent demise of literature.  These days there is only one reason to write a book:to be taken seriously.  And that is exactly what is about to happen to me.  I'm an author now!  Like Ernest Hemingway and Fyodor Dostoevsky!When I was asked to provide text for an author page, I decided to approach it in a scholarly manner, because that's what authors do.  I looked to other author pages for inspiration, and I learned so much.  For example, while Hemingway and Dostoevsky do not have their own author pages on Amazon.com, Paris Hilton does.  And so does former teenage porn star and multi-tasking fellatrix, Traci Lords.  Hemingway and Dostoevsky might be wondering, quite literally, \"Whom do I have to blow to get my own author page?\"  If someone had a cruel sense of humor, they might respond to Hemingway, \"How about your head off?  Oh wait &ndash; you already DID that!\"  But such a remark would be in bad taste, and as a serious author, I'm above all that.I also learned that Paris' dog, Tinkerbell Hilton, has her own book too.  I read a few pages and found the prose to be overwrought, but you can imagine that, being a dog, she'd be coming from a place of needing to prove something.  By the way, here's a quote from a review of Paris' book that I found on her Amazon.com author page:\"Heiress, socialite, model, actress, singer and media darling Hilton loves her life, knows how to get what she wants and matter-of-factly explains how anyone can be a glamorous, fun-loving, tiara-wearing heiress just like her&hellip; [Paris&rsquo;] advice to 'channel your own inner heiress, create your own image, and project an extreme sense of confidence' is an empowering message for young women.\"This was profoundly inspiring to me.  It made me realize: if young women can read Hilton's book and become heiresses, they can likewise read my book and become anxiety-ridden bedwetters.  And amidst this generation of disposability that favors the digital over the physical, shopping online rather than in stores (oops, this is awkward!), and reading from LCD screens rather than from print on paper, it's nice to know that I will have left a permanent stain by which future generations shall know of my existence.

Where Alice Humphreys came off as strong and directed in the earlier novel, New Yorker McKenna Wright seems insecure, much less comfortable in her skin. Plotting, too, is a little less focused than usual for Burke, whose Detective Ellie Hatcher series has earned accolades for character development and tightly controlled plotting. Even so, Burke manages to deliver some exciting moments here, as lawyer-turned-journalist McKenna finds her life turned upside down when she recognizes a friend from her college years who disappeared without a trace a decade before on a video of a near-tragedy on the subway. At the same time, McKenna&#x2019;s career takes a devastating hit when evidence turns up that compromising e-mails she used in an article about a judge originated not from the public but from her own computer. Stubborn curiosity about her friend and anger about unjust accusations propel McKenna forward into what others assert is ridiculously wild speculation. Not Burke&#x2019;s best, but still a solid thriller that will engage her growing audience. --Stephanie Zvirin",

Her attorney, William Messerlie, said that she died after a long illness.Born on June 3, 1939 in Alexandria, Louisiana, Mrs. Woodiwiss was the youngest of eight siblings. She long relished creating original narratives, and by age six was telling herself stories at night to help herself fall asleep. At age 16, she met U.S. Air Force Second Lieutenant Ross Woodiwiss at a dance, and they married the following year. She wrote her first book in longhand while living at a military outpost in Japan.Woodiwiss is credited with the invention of the modern historical romance novel: in 1972, she releasedThe Flame and the Flower, an instantNew York Timesbestseller, creating literary precedent. TheFlame and the Flowerrevolutionized mainstream publishing, featuring an epic historical romance with a strong heroine and impassioned sex scenes. \"Kathleeen E. Woodiwiss is the founding mother of the historical romance genre,\" says Carrie Feron, vice president/editorial director of William Morrow and Avon Books, imprints of HarperCollins Publishers. Feron, who has been Woodiwiss's editor for 13 years, continues, \"Avon Books is proud to have been Kathleen's sole publishing partner for her paperbacks and hardcover novels for more than three decades.\" Avon Books, a leader in the historical romance genre to this day, remains Mrs. Woodiwiss's original and only paperback publisher; William Morrow, Avon's sister company, publishes Mrs. Woodiwiss's hardcovers.The Flame and the Flowerwas rejected by agents and hardcover publishers, who deemed it as \"too long\" at 600 pages. Rather than follow the advice of the rejection letters and rewrite the novel, Mrs. Woodiwiss instead submitted it to paperback publishers. The first publisher on her list, Avon, quickly purchased the novel and arranged an initial 500,000 print run. The novel sold over 2.3 million copies in its first four years of publication.The success of this novel prompted a new style of writing romance, concentrating primarily on historical fiction tracking the monogamous relationship between a helpless heroines and the hero who rescued her, even if he had been the one to place her in danger. The romance novels which followed in her example featured longer plots, more controversial situations and characters, and more intimate and steamy sex scenes.\"Her words engendered an incredible passion among readers,\" notes Feron. Bestselling author Julia Quinn agrees, saying, \"Woodiwiss made women want to read. She gave them an alternative to Westerns and hard-boiled police procedurals. When I was growing up, I saw my mother and grandmother reading and enjoying romances, and when I was old enough to read them myself, I felt as if I had been admitted into a special sisterhood of reading women.\"New York Timesbestselling author Susan Elizabeth Phillips, a leading voice in the women's fiction arena, says, \"We all owe our careers to her. She opened the world of romance to us as readers. She created a career for us to go into.\"The pioneering author has written 13 novels over the course of 35 years, allNew York Timesbestsellers. Kathleen E. Woodiwiss's final literary work, the upcomingEverlasing, will be published by William Morrow in October 2007. \"Everlastingis Kathleen's final gift to her fans,\" notes Feron.Kathleen E.

Link, the hero of the adventure games, delighted millions by starring in games for each Nintendo console from the NES and Super NES to the Nintendo 64. Link brings this beloved franchise to the Nintendo GameCube inThe Legend Of Zelda: The Wind Waker, and he's moreanimatedthan ever.The first thing you'll notice aboutThe Legend Of Zelda: The Wind Wakeris that it looks completely different from any previous title in the franchise. Nintendo has opted to use cel-shading technology onWind Waker; the result is that the game looks like a cartoon. Die-hard Zelda purists initially howled at this change, arguing that the game skews too young. I think it's fantastic. The cartoon animation style allows for better expression of the characters, and several of the animations--like Link trying to pick up an object that's too heavy--are so cute that you can't help but laugh a little.The second thing you&#x92;ll notice is a focus on wind. Instead of trotting around on foot, Link travels from island to island on a talking boat, but he doesn't get far without the wind blowing in right direction. Luckily, you'll learn how to change the direction of the wind early in the game, and you'll do so frequently--not only to power your boat but also to solve puzzles. Clever use of wind makesWind Wakerstand out from more conventional adventure games.The third thing you&#x92;ll notice is that the game is just plain fun. Puzzles are innovative and refreshing, and despite some tricky puzzles, I never felt too frustrated to keep playing. The locales you'll visit are invariably exotic and fun to explore, and the host of bizarre creatures you'll encounter (friendly and otherwise) are always a kick in the pants. Moreover, though the look is radically different,Wind Wakerfeels like a classic Zelda game. Veterans of the early games in the franchise will experience more than a bit of nostalgia while playing it.The Legend Of Zelda: The Wind Wakeris everything you've come to expect from a Zelda game, and it's one of the best adventure games to date.

His writing is informal, relaxed, and playful, guiding the reader so effortlessly through our 23 chromosomes that by the end we wish we had more.  He believes that the Human Genome Project will be as world-changing as the splitting of the atom; if so, he is helping us prepare for exciting times--the hope of a cure for cancer contrasts starkly with the horrors of newly empowered eugenicists.

The billionaire scion tied two empty gas cans to his body for floatation and swam for shore, and by most accounts, he made it. But what happened there, when he encountered members of the Asmat tribe--a culture marked by ritual violence and cannibalism--has been long debated. Did he disappear into the tropical jungles, or was he rendered and eaten by the tribesmen, as many speculated and the Rockefeller family long denied? Award-winning journalist Carl Hoffman has stepped into Rockefeller&#x2019;s boot prints and Asmat society, interviewing generations of warriors in an exhaustive and engrossing attempt to solve the mystery. The result,Savage Harvest, succeeds not only as a captivating and sensational puzzle, but also as a (seemingly unlikely) modern adventure and a fascinating glimpse of an anachronistic people pulled into the 20th century by the tensions of global politics. So, did he make it? The title might offer a clue.--Jon Foro",

When handsome publisher  Jack Devlin knocks on her door, it doesn't take him long to figure out that  Amanda thinks he's someone else entirely. Intrigued, he stops just short of  taking the lady's virginity, for he has other plans for the talented writer.When she discovers Jack's true identity at a gathering of writers and  publishers, Amanda is first angry, then fascinated, as he is a powerful force in  the London publishing industry.

And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive.

Gina grows up, changes her name to Jane, and attends college, trying not only to assimilate but also to bridge contemporary class divisions of ethnicity amid competing values and economic theories. For those craving an easy, smooth read, the characters&#x2019; personal lives can engage emotionally, but Simons&#x2019; technique of self-conscious inner monologue is hyperbolic.

He also rails against the news media for displaying a disturbing lack of skepticism and for failing to do even the most basic homework when reporting on business and economic issues. The book is mainly a collection of op-ed pieces Krugman wrote forThe New York Timesbetween 2000 and 2003. Overall, this format works well.

Although the Arkham asylum is well fortified, he has a nagging feeling that all is not well, which proves to be the case when seconds after turning The Joker over to the guards, the master criminal breaks free of his captors. Even more surprising than this quick turn of events is the revelation that it was never The Joker's intent to escape the vault-like facility, but instead to trap Batman there. Surrounded by an asylum full of dangerous criminals, many of which he put there and all at the beck and call of the Joker, can Batman survive and discover what is behind the Joker's intricate plot?GameplayInBatman: Arkham Asylumplayers strap on the gadget-heavy utility belt of the Caped Crusader. Gameplay here is a combination of both the knuckle crunching rush of hand to hand combat as you take on the hordes of thugs that infest Arkham Asylum, and stealth gameplay in which you must dispatch individuals from the shadows. Players can expect an engrossing single player campaign in which Batman continually moves forward to face the henchmen, bosses and traps that The Joker has set for him. With regards to opponents, in addition to The Joker who you will hear more than you see, the dark walls of Arkham also hold familiar villains from the the Batman criminal universe including Harley Quinn, Victor Zsasz and Killer Croc, that you will have to deal with, but don't expect a one-dimensional experience. As players progress from environment to environment within Arkham they will have to use varying combinations of muscle, detective skills, gadgetry and a certain degree of light RPG-like leveling of Batman's skills, arsenal and physical characteristics to survive and discover what The Joker's underlying scheme is.In addition to the story-driven single player campaignArkham Asylumalso contains various additional play modes. These include an arcade styled combat mode where players accumulate points by engaging hordes of thugs in a hand to hand slugfest across a series of maps, in which Batman's physical strength and agility play a major role. The key here is to chain together as many attacks as possible due to the fact that with each successful combo players increase the point multiplier associated with their actions. The game also features a time-based stealth mode where players must hone their ability to strike silently from the shadows. This gameplay, referred to as 'Invisible Predator' utilizes the Dark Knight's skill with gadgets like the grapple tool, batarang and explosives. These allow for vertical/horizontal mobility, the ability to quickly strike from above and at a distance and to take out enemies and create distractions, even through walls. But remember that Batman works solo and is not superhuman. Your enemies will congregate around trouble areas and work as a team against you, so you must be silent, plan your attacks wisely, strike quickly and discover the value of encouraging fear within enemies.Key FeaturesUtilize the unique FreeFlow combat system to chain together unlimited combos seamlessly and battle with huge groups of The Joker's henchmen in brutal melee brawls.Investigate as Batman, the world's greatest detective, by solving intricate puzzles with the help of cutting edge forensic tools including x-ray scanning, fingerprint scans, 'Amido Black' spray and a pheromone tracker.Face off against Gotham's greatest villains including The Joker, Harley Quinn, Victor Zsasz and Killer Croc.Become the Invisible Predator with Batman's fear takedowns and unique vantage point system to move without being seen and hunt enemies.Choose multiple takedown methods, including swooping from the sky and smashing through walls, and use the predator camera get a closer look at the action.Explore every inch of Arkham Asylum and roam freely on the infamous island, presented for the first time ever in its gritty and realistic entirety.Experience what it's like to be Batman using batarangs, explosive gel aerosol, the Batclaw, sonar resonator and the line launcher.Unlock more secrets by completing hidden challenges in the world and develop and customize equipment by earning experience points.Enjoy complete superhero freedom in the environment with the use of Batman's grapple to get to any place you can see, jump from any height and glide in any direction.",

As coauthor of the two most important scientific papers on this topic, she's ideally suited to popularize the idea. What is absolutely clear is that physicists simply do not yet know if there are extra dimensions a fraction of a millimeter in size, dimensions of infinite size or only the dimensions we see. What's also clear is that the large hadron collider, the world's most powerful tool for studying subatomic particles, is likely to provide information permitting scientists to differentiate among these ideas soon after it begins operation in Switzerland in 2007.

As a young child in California and, after her parents&#x2019; divorce, Nashville, she knew she had to write, and she was fortunate, as she so warmly and vividly explains, in her writing teachers&#x2014;Allan Gurganus, Grace Paley, and Russell Banks&#x2014;and in her success supporting herself by writing nonfiction for magazines and newspapers, beginning with Seventeen and extending to the New York Times Magazine, GQ, Vogue, and Gourmet. Patchett now assembles a retrospective set of 22 sterling personal essays to form an episodic, piquant, instructive, and entertaining self-portrait. She reflects on her family, life on a Tennessee farm, literary discipline and inspiration, and her failed first marriage.

        "0060002484": "The use of mass market originals as a farm team for hardcovers has lost popularity, but still works occasionally, as with Rollins, whose three mass markets (Deep Fathom, Excavation and Subterranean) displayed a flair for brawny adventure within an exotic locale a flair put to good use in his hardcover debut. A U.S. Special Forces agent walks out of the Amazon jungle and quickly dies of rampant tumors; what's especially bizarre is that this man has two arms, but when he entered the jungle five years before as part of a biopharmaceutical exploratory expedition, which has been lost track of, he had only one. The rest of the novel follows a group of scientists and U.S. military guardians as they trek deep into the jungle in search of the missing expedition and, hopefully, the secret to the regrown arm a secret that takes on vast importance when the dead agent's body, shipped to the States, spreads a disease that threatens to wipe out the American population. Meanwhile, a second, predatory expedition, led by a French psychopath, surreptitiously follows the first, aiming to steal whatever cure the searchers uncover; both expeditions wind up at the isolated home of a legendary tribe and the malignant, giant tree that sustains it. Rollins won't win awards for his prose or characters, though both function smoothly in this boldly drawn entertainment, and there's little here that isn't a variation of some classic adventure trope. His pacing is forceful, however, and his atmospherics rich, with giant caimans and jaguars, mutant amphibians and hungry locusts adding to the mayhem, a high body count and a congenial sense of the ridiculous although Rollins plays it deadpan. This is old-fashioned, rugged adventure in the tradition of Haggard and Crichton, told with energy, excitement and a sense of fun.

The 23-year-old South Carolina native, who's spent six months in Belgium studying French and the Congolese language of Tshiluba, has come to Belle Vue to run a missionary guesthouse, where she soon employs one of a local witch doctor's two wives, the delightful, no-nonsense Cripple. The discovery of a huge uncut diamond sets off a chain of unfortunate events leading to Cripple's being charged with murder. This marks a major breakthrough for Myers as she displays storytelling skills not recently seen in the claustrophobic confines of her Pennsylvania-Dutch (Batter Off Dead) and Den of Antiquity (Poison Ivory) mystery series.(Nov.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0062019740": "A prequel of sorts to Sands's paranormal comedy, Single White Vampire, this lightweight romantic romp shoots for the easy laugh and often misses. The allure of vampires lies in their strength and seeming invulnerability, but Etienne Argeneau, this book's bloodsucking hero, is curiously incompetent when it comes to dispatching a crazed mortal named Pudge who's intent on lopping his head off. Twice, Pudge manages to injure Etienne to the point where he ends up in the morgue under coroner Rachel Garrett's care. But when Rachel gets in the way of attempt number three, Etienne rescues her in the only way he knows how-by turning her into a vampire. The story moves from mildly amusing to ridiculous when Rachel, in denial, insists that she's merely having a \"wet dream\" involving a sexy man who thinks he's a vampire. There's little tension between Etienne and Rachel, sexual or otherwise. Instead, Sands stretches the plot with conflicts stemming from minor misunderstandings. Her attempts at hip dialogue also fall flat (at one point, a 200-year-old vampire compliments Rachel by saying, \"You're a happening chick, dudette!\"). Those who enjoyed Sands's previous paranormal comedy of errors may eke a little enjoyment from these pages, but this isn't something vampire fans will want to sink their teeth into.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0099457156": "In 1970, small town newspaperThe Clanton Timeswent belly up. With financial assistance from a rich relative, it's purchased by 23-year-old Willie Traynor, formerly the paper's cub reporter. Soon afterward, his new business receives the readership boost it needs thanks to his editorial efforts and coverage of a particularly brutal rape and murder committed by the scion of the town's reclusive bootlegger family. Rather than shy from reporting on the subsequent open-and-shut trial (those who oppose the Padgitt family tend to turn up dead in the area's swampland), Traynor launches a crusade to ensure the unrepentant murderer is brought to justice. When a guilty verdict is returned, the town is relieved to find the Padgitt family's grip on the town did not sway the jury, though Danny Padgitt is sentenced to life in prison rather than death. But, when Padgitt is released after serving less than a decade in jail and members of the jury are murdered, Clanton once again finds itself at the mercy of its renegade family.When it comes, the d&#xE9;nouement is no surprise;The Last Juroris less a story of suspense than a study of the often idyllic southern town of Clanton, Mississippi (the setting for Grisham's first novel,A Time to Kill). Throughout the nine years between Padgitt's trial and release, Traynor finds acceptance in Clanton, where the people \"don't really trust you unless they trusted your grandfather.\" He grows from a long-haired idealist into another of the town's colorful characters--renovating an old house, sporting a bowtie, beloved on both sides of the color line, and the only person to have attended each of the town's 88 churches at least once.The Last Jurorreturns Grisham to the courtroom where he made his name, but those who enjoyed the warm sentiment of his recent novels (Bleachers,A Painted House) will still find much to love here.--Benjamin Reese--This text refers to theHardcoveredition.",

Well, Forrest Griffin is not as good-looking as those guys. He's not as smart as them. He's also not as athletically endowed. And let's face it, neither are you. Those other fighters are pretty much better than you in every way. But you can actually aspire to be as good as Forrest one day. Why? Because he is nothing special, just like you.Forrest is not a martial artist. He's a fighter, and this book was written for his kin. If you're a hillbilly like Forrest and you get off on having your face rearranged,Got Fight?is for you. This is a manifesto more strategic than Sun Tzu'sThe Art of War, more philosophical than Bruce Lee'sTao of Jeet Kune Do, more powerful than a well-lubricated locomotive.In these pages you will learn about true mental toughness&#8212;whether it's scraping it out in the Octagon or picking up chicks. You will learn about the mental defects that made Forrest Griffin into the abomination he is today and how you can use your shortcomings to become equally horrible. You will learn the essential tactics of hand-to-hand combat as well as how to defend yourself in the event of a sword attack. Never been attacked by a sword?

Youngest daughters Ruth Plank and Dana Dickerson, born on the same day in the same hospital, take turns narrating the struggles they face as children. Ruth feels a coldness from her mother; Dana is unsettled by her kooky parents constantly uprooting her and her brother Ray. Regardless, the Planks pay a yearly visit to the Dickersons no matter where they've ended up living. As the girls come of age, Ruth takes an interest in art, sex, and Dana's brother, Ray, with whom she later reunites, at Woodstock, in a swirl of drugs and mud. Meanwhile, Dana realizes that her desires are directed toward women and sets off to pursue agricultural studies at a university, where she meets Clarice, an assistant professor. As time goes by, the floundering Plank Farm is in danger of being seized by Ruth's former boyfriend, a man who has had his eye on the land for years. As Ruth and Dana pursue love, contemplate children, and search for home, the truth of what unites their families is finally--at long last--revealed, in this beautifully written book.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Eighteen months later only one ship remained and 18 passengers survived. Marco Polo never revealed what happened to these lost ships. Embarking on a quest to find the lost fleet, fortune hunter Nathan Drake soon realizes Marco Polo was hiding a much bigger secret - he had gone on a secret expedition to find the mythical kingdom of Shambhala and to recover the legendary Cintamani Stone, the \"Wish-fulfilling jewel\" of Buddhist mythology. With this new information Drake settles on a new course, following Marco Polo's trail through a diverse range of exotic environments. This quest also pits him against a new, more formidable adversary - a ruthless, rogue paramilitary leader with a private army and a relentless ambition to recover the stone for himself.GameplayAlthough gameplay inAmong Thievesis similar to that of the previous game, there are several major differences. The most important of these is the addition of several online multiplayer options. Unfortunately, no offline multiplayer could be included in the game due to the impact local split-screening has on the game's graphical quality. Thankfully though, the online modes included cover both co-op and competitive play. See the feature list below for details on these. In addition to play modes players can also expect a wealth of new gameplay features including a new stealth gameplay mechanic and altered climbing mechanic--both of which are extended to the AI of enemies; the ability to create cover by flipping over certain found items; the use of riot shields for defense and offense; and a complete lack of loading screens.Key Game FeaturesPowered by Naughty Dog&rsquo;s new 2.0 Engine Technology.Open layout allows players to take an aggressive or stealth approach to combat.Free-flowing \"traversal gunplay\" adds a unique vertical element to standard 3rd-person shooting mechanics.Award-winning cinematic story presentation.A Deep Single Player CampaignAn expanded cast of characters who reflect different facets of Drake&rsquo;s character, including Chloe Frazer, Drake&rsquo;s current partner and new romantic interest.Varied and exotic locations &ndash; from lush, green swamps and dense urban environments, all the way to the ice and snow of the Himalayas.Unrestricted combat allows you to take an aggressive or stealthy approach to combat.Free-flowing \"traversal gunplay\" adds a unique vertical element to familiar cover-based third-person shooting mechanics, allowing you to engage in combat from any position in the environment &ndash; even while climbing and hanging.Introduction of new traversal and free-climbing mechanics allow Drake to navigate through the environments more fluidly and naturally.Gunplay and combat enhancements, including an expanded melee system, and a variety of enemy types with advanced AI routines.

        "B00006IR62": "Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship",
        "0062135252": "A Russian scientist with a weapon that could wreak havoc upon the world; a chilling historical mystery; a breakneck race against time&#x2014;the usual kinds of ingredients, in other words, for one of Rollins&#x2019; Sigma Force novels. But this one&#x2019;s a bit different: it stars former Army Ranger Tucker Wayne and his working dog, Kane (introduced in Bloodline, 2012), and it spends more time than usual exploring the relationships of its lead characters. Rollins, who was a practicing veterinarian before turning to full-time writing, makes Kane, a Belgian Malinois (they look a lot like German shepherds), a fully participating character in the story, similar to the way Jonathan Maberry makes Ghost a character in the Joe Ledger novels. Coauthor Blackwood is best known for the three Fargo novels he wrote with Clive Cussler, but his solo trilogy featuring covert op Briggs Tanner, published 2001&#x2013;03, gives him solid grounding for this novel. Fans of the Sigma Force series will definitely enjoy this one, and readers who have occasionally wished Rollins would slow down a bit and spend some time with his characters will get their wish. --David Pitt",

McKay writes in the voice of shipbuilder's daughter, Dora Rare, \"the only daughter in five generations of Rares,\" who as a girl befriends the elderly and estranged Marie Babineau, long the local midwife (ortraiteur), who claims to have marked Dora out from birth as her successor. After initial reluctance and increasingly intensive training, 17-year-old Dora moves in with Marie; on the eve of Dora's marriage to Archer Bigelow, Marie disappears, leaving Dora her practice. A difficult marriage, many difficult births, a patient's baby thrust on her to raise without warning and other crises (including WWI and the introduction of \"clinical\" birthing methods) ensue. Period advertisments, journal entries and letters to and from various characters give Dora's voice context. The book is more about the texture of Dora's life than plot, and McKay handles the proceedings with winning, unsentimental care.(Sept.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0061931411": "*Starred Review* The second volume of the Rain Wilds Chronicles shows Hobb again working at the highest level of contemporary fantasy, to which her creativity with dragons adds additional&#x2014;there's no other word for it&#x2014;majesty. Battered, bruised, and lamed sea serpents have returned to the Rain Wild River to lay eggs that will hatch into dragons. But the dragon hatchlings are feeble, misshapen, unable to fly. They can't even survive without the assistance of human Dragon Keepers. Keepers and dragons make a perilous foray up the river in search of the long lost Elderling city of Kelsingra, which possibly holds the key to the dragons' survival. Tight bonds unite the humans to their ancient liveship Tarma, but as they voyage upriver they find the landscape hideously altered by earthquakes and storms. Starvation stalks them, and the bonds among humans, at least, fray even without any open treachery gnawing at them. The Rain Wilds is one of the most gripping settings in modern fantasy, highly to Hobb's credit, and an entire novel amid its lowering trees and rock formations would be impossible to put down even without Hobb's superior skills at characterization. Let us applaud, and shelve this with the rest of Hobb's magisterial fantasy fiction, though it won't stay on the shelf long. --Roland Green",

        "B001BNFQKO": "What does the American Dream mean today?For Niko Bellic, fresh off the boat from Europe, it is the hope he can escape his past. For his cousin, Roman, it is the vision that together they can find fortune in Liberty City, gateway to the land of opportunity. As they slip into debt and are dragged into a criminal underworld by a series of shysters, thieves and sociopaths, they discover that the reality is very different from the dream in a city that worships money and status, and is heaven for those who have them and a living nightmare for those who don&rsquo;t.Beginning with the 1997 release of the originalGrand Theft Auto, theGTAseries has been one of the most prolific, controversial and down right entertaining franchises in video games history. This pedigree of success guarantees that the highly anticipated eleventh game in the series,Grand Theft Auto IV, will garner at least as much attention if not more.Return to Liberty City.The dream as Niko expected it.View larger.There's always a catch.View larger.But some skills are international.View larger.The PlotGrand Theft Auto IVis a brand new adventure in theGTAuniverse following the experiences of Nikolai \"Niko\" Bellic, a new immigrant from an undisclosed eastern European country whose troubled pa st and the persuasion of his cousin Roman have brought him to the fictional Liberty City. Unfortunately, Niko&rsquo;s search for the American Dream and a much needed fresh start, hits an immediate snag when the rags to riches story Roman spun to pique Niko's interest is exposed as not only a complete fabrication, but a ploy to enlist Niko&rsquo;s well-known skills as a tough guy against the ample list of enemies clamoring for Roman&rsquo;s debt-ridden blood.Because Roman is the only person Niko knows in Liberty City he begrudgingly accepts his role as Roman&rsquo;s protector despite the deception. But as time goes on Niko comes into his own, and his experience on the wrong side of the tracks proves more valuable than he could have ever imagined as he fights for survival and later supremacy on the crime ridden streets of Liberty City.Game EnvironmentsBased on several of the boroughs of New York City and parts of New Jersey, Liberty City, familiar to players of previous games in the series, has been entirely redesigned forGTA IV. Players can expect visible detail down to the weeds growing in the cracks in the sidewalk, cars and buildings of visibly different ages and a much greater level if verticality in the buildings and bridges that they are able to explore as Niko moves through the city streets. In addition, pedestrians inGTA IVare much more realistic. No longer simply moving cardboard cutouts, these NPCs are intelligent, modern, human representations that laugh, cry, eat, drink, use cell phones and ATMs, and talking amongst themselves regardless of Niko&rsquo;s interaction with them.GameplayHistoricallyGTAgames have focused heavily on mission-based play, requiring successful completion of fixed tasks in order for players to progress through the game, but this has changed to a great extent inGTA IV. Players will experience an entirely new and exciting emphasis centered on the blending of on-mission and off-mission play, resulting not only in an increased sense of realism, but more interesting and unrestricted gameplay.FeaturesAside from the car jacking and a detailed city environment here are the new features forGTA IV:Improved combat system - Now you can use cover and also a target lock system, which allows you to take out targets with greater ease and accuracy. Plus, you can engage in some hand-to-hand combat if you can't get your hands on a piece quick enough.Cell phone - Not just for basic phone calls anymore. Use your in-game cell phone to receive missions via SMS, snap photos, and ZiT (tag) songs that can be downloaded exclusively on Amazon.com/mp3.Free time - In between missions you can take advantage of \"me\" time. There are gentleman's clubs, comedy clubs, bowling alleys, and bars, which all house unique activities.Take a break from the storyline - A variety of side missions allow you to help run a car service, \"borrow\" cop cars, assassinate targets, help solve problems for those on the street, or take to the air with stunt jumps that are scattered all over the city.Control your own fate - Throughout the game choice moments will arrive causing you to make a decision that will affect relationships and money.MultiplayerGive Niko a rest and create your own multiplayer \"hero.\"GTAhas added multiplayer modes allowing you to take your creation out to play online in competitive, co-op, and free form modes. Competitive mode has you fighting against the cops, jacking cars, or racing to finish odd jobs. Co-op challenges you and your friends with various tasks including Hangman's NOOSE where you are responsible for escorting a wanted kingpin to a safe extraction point. Freeform lets you and 15 others lose on Liberty City. Use this mode to hit up the bar and play virtual darts versus each other or head out to the streets and set up your own drag races. If you can dream it, you can do it in Freeform mode.ZiT: We'll Spot The Song For YouWhen playing Grand Theft Auto IV, if you hear a song that you are interested in buying as an MP3, all you have to do is dial ZiT-555-0100 on your in-game mobile phone and a text message will be sent to you with the name of the artist and the title of the track. The next time you log in at theRockstar Games Social Club, you will find 30-second previews of all the songs you have ZiT'ed while playing the game.

        "0060539097": "With its wit (the book is dedicated to Onan), its victim narrative (multiple sexual assaults), its celebrity dish (Howard Stern is actually well endowed), and its frank, one-fisted prose style (\"After three hours of sweaty, psychotic sex, she handed me a huge black strap-on\"), the queen of porn's autobiography is destined to become a lowbrow classic. Jameson's career began at 16, when she fell for Jack, a tattoo artist. At a party, Jack's neo-Nazi uncle raped Jameson. Unable to face her father, a Las Vegas cop, she moved in with Jack. Within a year, she went from high school cheerleader to stripper to nude model to porn actress, with a stop along the way to become a crack addict. Jameson's life wasn't so much a downward spiral as a freefall into darkness. But, as the porn world would have it, the harder she fell, the more everyone wanted her, and she quickly became a top nude model and porn star, and the country's highest-paid feature dancer, all while leaving a path of carnage worthy of several rock bands. Beneath Jameson's monstrous diva exterior, however, was a girl who just wanted to become a loving mother and wife. After many failures, she finally succeeded, and her X-rated book ends on an uplifting family-values note. Jameson's life was a mess, and with its multiple formats (interview transcripts, movie scripts, advice sidebars, diary entries, cartoon strips), so is this book. But it's a remarkably appealing and honest mess, and should earn Jameson some of the mainstream acceptance she so clearly desires.

        "0060548940": "&ldquo;Elphaba&rsquo;s Heirs and Assigns&rdquo; by Gregory MaguireDepending on how you count the years, I am about at my 25th anniversary of the original inspiration forWicked. I was on a walk on a country road in Massachusetts, thinking myopically and somewhat self-regardingly about various offenses that I felt had been perpetrated against me. I was wondering about how apparently trustworthy people could turn dangerous, or if they really had been dangerous all along, merely well-disguised, even from themselves? A standard issue college dorm question, I suppose, but the matter seemed urgent to me that year. I moved from the slightly sore subject of my personal life into the realm of imagination to keep the question alive without it hurting so much, and almost immediately I thought of the Wicked Witch of the West--admittedly, more Margaret Hamilton than L. Frank Baum--and I wondered: Was she always terrible?The momentary crisis of that year, combined with attention to acts of evil and distress in our larger world a few years later, brought me into Oz and the world ofWicked. Still, even eight years later whenWickedwas first published, I hadn't expected that the story would remain a presence in the world. I had an imagination big enough to see into every cranny of Oz, but not big enough to imagine that anyone else might get interested, and stay interested.After the story of Elphaba hit the bookstores, the national bestseller lists, the book clubs, and then the Broadway stage, the increasing attention to the story prompted me to go back and follow up the clues I had liberally sprinkled in the first book.Son of a Witchposited that Elphaba and Fiyero had an illegitimate boy, and considered the troubles he would have first growing up with the Witch as a negligent mother and then, even worse, with his negligent mother gone from his life.A Lion Among Menfollowed up with the Cowardly Lion's tale. Why the Lion and not the Tin Woodman or the Scarecrow, readers ask me. For a number of reasons, but chief among them is that the Lion is an Animal, and Elphaba's concern for the flight of talking Animals makes his life story more urgent to the themes of the Wicked Years sequence.So finally we come toOut of Oz, the fourth and I believe final book in the series. I feel both elated and elegiac to be bringing it to readers. I get to revisit characters I love--Glinda, under house arrest; the Cowardly Lion, on the run from the law; Liir, the Witch's boy; and a little girl growing up in the shadows who may be pivotal to the resolution of military and social struggle in Oz.Oh, and yes--Dorothy too. Dorothy Gale. That Dorothy. She comes on for something more than a curtain call. Face it: you always knew Dorothy was too strong a force to stay buckled down on the Kansas prairie, didn't you? No earthly gravity can hold that girl in one place for long: she defies gravity, too, only without the broomstick.Come for a visit and stay a while.

Huang is a spoiled rich kid who expects everything to run smoothly, but his trip does not go exactly as planned. Only minutes after arriving at the Liberty City airport at the far end of town, he is robbed and left to die. Only through quickly thinking is he able to survive and make his way back to his neighborhood, but the damage to he and his family has been done. Now his destiny is to search for honor, riches and revenge in the most dangerous and morally bankrupt city in the world.GameplayThe largest DS game to date,Chinatown Warsis set in theGrand Theft Auto IV-imagined version of Liberty City, and contains most of its boroughs and neighborhoods. In exploring and exploiting this vast area, players use the game's rotatable camera to take in a 3D, 360-degree view of their environment, providing an elevated and somewhat skewed third-person perspective, that switches to first-person with the appropriate player action. Assuming the role of Huang Lee your goal is to rise up in the ranks of the underworld to challenge the Triad of Chinatown gangs that have usurped your family's position and recover the stolen heirloom and your lost honor. In trueGTAfashion this entails gameplay that embraces the seedy underbelly that Liberty City is famous for. Throughout the game's 70+ missions -- all of which can be replayed even after completion -- and its myriad of side quests, players earn cash by completing jobs ranging from petty street crime, all the way up to drug dealing and assassination. As in otherGTAreleases, rising competence at crime raises the amount of attention received by police, but unlike previous games here players can not simply outrun alerted authorities. With each additional star added to your 'wanted rating' players must disable or destroy more of the pursuing police units to keep them off your tail. In addition to mission play, the game also contains many opportunities, such as the safe cracking and car hot-wiring mini-games and the various items and weapons hidden throughout the game that demand skill with the DS' touchscreen and stylus for success. By whatever means, once players have attained a certain level of cash and street cred they will also be able to recruit members for their own gang who pledge their loyalty by allowing themselves to be tattooed with the mark of the player's choosing.Cars and ControlsCars and control schemes play a prominent role inChinatown Wars. All cars feature GPS functionality based on available roadways. Directions are shown on the lower of the DS' two screens as part of the in-game PDA interface, but players may take vehicles off roads wherever possible, with the GPS automatically resetting when back on the pavement. While driving players also have access to five in-game radio stations and use of their weapons. Your PDA provides efficient management tools for your growing crime empire, including quick weapons switching, a running total of available cash, in-game e-mail and Internet access and nearly instant game saves any time. The control scheme inChinatown Warsutilizes an easy to use and comfortable to play combination of steering via the D-pad, choice of action through the face buttons and/or stylus taps and manual and automatic weapon locks and unlocks via shoulder buttons.Key Game Features:The Largest DS Game Ever- Contemporary Liberty City is a massive world complete with pedestrians, weather and traffic patterns, five different radio stations and four different sprawling boroughs to explore.Endless Gameplay- Mature storyline with over 70+ story missions; plus dozens of side quests, collectibles, contextual mini-games and the all new mission replay feature.Street Economics- Addictive drug dealing side game with 6 different drug types, 80+ drug dealers and a supply / demand driven narcotics economy.Play with Friends- Nintendo Wi-Fi mode for head-to-head and co-op multiplayer mayhem.Bragging Rights- Chat, trade guns and commodities with your friends, and compete for glory via online tournaments and leaderboards on the Rockstar Games Social Club.PDA Interface- Use the touch screen as a PDA device to set GPS waypoints, change radio stations, communicate via e-mail with in-game characters and order weapons on the Internet.Online Bragging Rights and MultiplayerCare has been taken to ensure that players can share theirChinatown Warsexperiences with friends and fellow players in different ways.

While this might seem like a no-brainer, Prose (Blue Angel;A Changed Man) masterfully meditates on how quality reading informs great writing, which will warm the cold, jaded hearts of even the most frustrated, unappreciated and unpublished writers. Chapters treat the nuts and bolts of writing (words, sentences, paragraphs) as well as issues of craft (narration, character, dialogue), all of which Prose discusses using story or novel excerpts. This is where the book truly shines; Prose is remarkably egalitarian in choosing exemplars of fiction: David Gates, Denis Johnson, John le Carr&eacute; and ZZ Packer, for instance, are considered as seriously as Chekhov, Melville, Flaubert or Babel. Prose insists that \"literature not only breaks the rules, but makes us realize that thereare none,\" and urges writers to re-read the classics (Chekhov, especially) and view \"reading as something that might move or delight you.\" Prose's guide to reading and writing belongs on every writer's bookshelf alongside E.M.

        "0061230839": "Quinn's first title since 1999 not to feature the Bridgerton clan (On the Way to the Wedding), this Regency concerns Miranda Cheever, who fell in love with the aristocratic Nigel Bevelstoke, Viscount Turner, when she was 10 and he 19. Now 20, and still in love, Miranda's designs are thwarted by the indiscretions of Nigel's late wife&mdash;heartbroken, Nigel isn't willing to risk another shot at love, even if it means hurting his close friend Miranda. Quinn's pitch-perfect humor remains intact, but her latest relies too much on romance conventions, including Miranda's scholarly but benignly neglectful father; an even more overused device involves Turner's hot-and-cold feelings toward Miranda, which reduce the heroine to tears more than once. However, the two make a lovable couple, and Miranda in particular shines, as do Turner's two siblings in strong secondary roles. Though a bit stale, this well-written, often funny and occasionally tender romance has much to enjoy.(July)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In the Republic of Gilead, formerly the United States, far-right Schlafly/Falwell-type ideals have been carried to extremes in the monotheocratic government. The resulting society is a feminist's nightmare: women are strictly controlled, unable to have jobs or money and assigned to various classes: the chaste, childless Wives; the housekeeping Marthas; and the reproductive Handmaids, who turn their offspring over to the \"morally fit\" Wives.

Their stories are intercut with those of Kennit, the ambitious pirate Brashen, the disinherited scion of another family who served on the Vestritt's ship, andParagon, an old liveship  abandoned and believed mad.   The sentient sea serpents have their own story hinted at, as well.ThoughShip of Magicis full of action, none of the plotlines get resolved in this book.

Those familiar with the earlier work of Ehrman, a distinguished professor of religious studies at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and author of more than 20 books including Misquoting Jesus, will not be surprised at the content of this one. Written in a manner accessible to nonspecialists, Ehrman argues that many books of the New Testament are not simply written by people other than the ones to whom they are attributed, but that they are deliberate forgeries. The word itself connotes scandal and crime, and&nbsp;it appears on nearly every page. Indeed, this book takes on an idea widely accepted by biblical scholars: that writing in someone else's name was common practice and perfectly okay in ancient times. Ehrman argues that it was not even then&nbsp;considered acceptable&mdash;hence, a forgery. While many readers may wish for more evidence of&nbsp;the charge, Ehrman's introduction to the arguments and debates among different religious communities during the first few centuries and among&nbsp;the early Christians themselves, though not the book's main point, is especially valuable.

In this world, Helen and her demigod cousins are descended from one of Four Houses, and the Furies make them all enemies of one another. Despite the fact that Helen and Lucas were from enemy Houses and wanted to kill each other in Starcrossed, they fell in love and then discovered that they were first cousins. Now, they're finding it hard to resist their mutual attration, despite knowing its wrong. Then Orion shows up to rival Lucas for Helen's affections. Helen can fly and throw lightning bolts but makes mistakes and, like all the Gods, is guilty of hubris. She finds herself in horrific situations and the only way she can end each night so she can wake up to try again is to die - by quicksand, falling, etc.-and this is taking a terrible physical toll on her. The violence that the Gods and demigods inflict upon one another is compelling, but also brutal. Enough of the events from Starcrossed are recounted that it's not essential to have read it first. Unfinished events in this book guarantee another installment in this series that's loosely based on the Helen of Troy myth.

Kate, a successful attorney, is determined to find out even as she is haunted by the fear she has failed her daughter, too often putting her career ahead of her responsibilities as a mother. McCreight has written an elaborately plotted mystery that not only tells Kate&#x2019;s story but also includes Amelia&#x2019;s own first-person narrative along with her e-mails, texts, and Facebook posts, all of which tell a harrowing story while keeping the reader one step ahead of Kate and the police.

If you have been introduced to the three Baudelaire orphans in any of Lemony Snicket's previous novels, you know that not only will their lives not get better, they will get much worse. In the fourth installment in the \"Series of Unfortunate Events,\" the sorrowful siblings, having once again narrowly escaped the clutches of the evil Count Olaf, are escorted by the kindly but ineffectual Mr. Poe to their newest \"home\" at the Lucky Smells Lumbermill. Much to their horror (if not surprise), their dormitory at the mill is crowded and damp, they are forced to work with spinning saw blades, they are fed only one meal a day (not counting the chewing gum they get for lunch), and worst of all, Count Olaf lurks in a dreadful disguise as Shirley the receptionist just down the street. Not even the clever wordplay and ludicrous plot twists could keep this story buoyant--reading about the mean-spirited foreman, the deadly blades, poor Klaus (hypnotized and \"reprogrammed\"), and the relentless hopelessness of the children's situation only made us feel gloomy. Fans of these wickedly funny, suspenseful adventures won't want to miss out on a single one, but we're hoping the next tales have the delicate balance of delight and disaster we've come to expect from this exciting series.

Wolfish top boss Tanner Kingsley vows to find the perpetrator; meanwhile, stunning artist Diane Stevens, wife of a just-murdered KIG scientist, and supermodel Kelly Harris, whose husband has likewise been killed, find themselves under attack by mysterious strangers. Diane and Kelly form an uneasy alliance, though both spend most of their time ruminating on their wonderful (now dead) husbands: \"I want to feel you stroking my breast.... I want to imagine that I can hear your voice saying that I make the best paella in the world....\" The plot is straightforward: people are killed, women are in peril and an evil CEO (Tanner, gasp!) has a plot to take over the world. His technique involves controlling the weather, and in an intriguing short afterword, Sheldon explains the very real possibilities of just such a scenario. The on-the-lam ladies, Kelly and Diane, escape every assassination attempt with ridiculous ease, and other characters appear and disappear simply in order to get the author out of one plot pickle after another.

        "0061243582": "Equal parts droll and gorgeous nostalgia book and heartfelt plea for a renewed sense of adventure in the lives of boys and men, Conn and Hal Iggulden'sThe Dangerous Book for Boysbecame a mammoth bestseller in the United Kingdom in 2006. Adapted, in moderation, for American customs in this edition (cricket is gone, rugby remains; conkers are out, Navajo Code Talkers in),The Dangerous Bookis a guide book for dads as well as their sons, as a reminder of lore and technique that have not yet been completely lost to the digital age. Recall the adventures of Scott of the Antarctic and the Battle of the Somme, relearn how to palm a coin, tan a skin, and, most charmingly, wrap a package in brown paper and string. The book's ambitions are both modest and winningly optimistic: you get the sense that by learning how to place a splint or write in invisible ink, a boy might be prepared for anything, even girls (which warrant a small but wise chapter of their own).InsideThe Dangerous Book for BoysFigure 8 KnotSheet Bend KnotThe Battle of WaterlooQuestions for Conn IgguldenConn and Hal Iggulden are two brothers who have not forgotten what it was like to be boys. Conn taught for many years before becoming one of the most admired and popular young historical novelists with his Emperor series, based on the life of Julius Caesar, and his newly embarked series on Genghis Khan, while Hal is a theater director. We asked Conn about their collaboration.Amazon.com:It's difficult to describe what a phenomenonThe Dangerous Book for Boyswas in the UK last year. When I would check the bestseller list on our sister site, Amazon.co.uk, there would be, along with your book, which spent much of the year at the top of the list, a half-dozen apparent knockoff books of similar boy knowledge. Clearly, you tapped into something big. What do you think it was?Iggulden:In a word, fathers. I am one myself and I think we've become aware that the whole \"health and safety\" overprotective culture isn't doing our sons any favors. Boys need to learn about risk. They need to fall off things occasionally, or--and this is the important bit--they'll take worse risks on their own. If we do away with challenging playgrounds and cancel school trips for fear of being sued, we don't end up with safer boys--we end up with them walking on train tracks. In the long run, it's not safe at all to keep our boys in the house with a Playstation. It's not good for their health or their safety.You only have to push a boy on a swing to see how much enjoys the thrill of danger. It's hard-wired. Remove any opportunity to test his courage and they'll find ways to test themselves that will be seriously dangerous for everyone around them. I think of it like playing the lottery--someone has to say \"Look, youwon'twin--and your childrenwon'tbe hurt. Relax. Itwon'tbe you.\"I think that's the core of the book's success. It isn't just a collection of things to do. The heroic stories alone are something we haven't had for too long. It isn't about climbing Everest, but it is an attitude, a philosophy for fathers and sons. Our institutions are too wrapped up in terror over being sued--so we have to do things with them ourselves. This book isn't a bad place to start.As for knockoff books--great. They'll give my son something to read that doesn't involve him learning a dull moral lesson of some kind--just enjoying an adventure or learning skills and crafts so that he has a feeling of competence and confidence--just as we have.Amazon.com:You made some changes for the U.S. edition, and I for one am sorry that you have removed the section on conkers, if only because it's such a lovely and mysterious word. What are (or what is) conkers?Iggulden:Horse chestnuts strung on a shoelace and knocked against one another until they shatter. In the entire history of the world, no one has ever been hurt by a conker, but it's still been banned by some British schools,just in case. Another school banned paper airplanes. Honestly, it's enough to make you weep, if I did that sort of thing, which I try not to. Reading Jane Austen is still allowed, however.Amazon.com:What knowledge did you decide was important to add for American boys? I notice in both editions you have an excellent and useful section on table football, as played with coins. Is paper football strictly an American pastime? I'm not sure I could have gotten through the fourth grade without it.Iggulden:I like knowing the details of battles, so Gettysburg and the Alamo had to go in, along with the Gettysburg address, stickball, state capitals, U.S. mountains, American trees, insects, U.S. historical timelines, and a lot of others. Navajo code talkers of WWII is a great chapter. It probably helps that I am a huge fan of America. It was only while rewriting for the U.S. that I realized how many positive references there already are. You have NASA and NASA trumps almost anything.As for paper football, ever since I thought of putting the book together, people keep saying things like \"You have rockets in there, yes? Everyone loves rockets!\" Paper football is the first American one, but there will be many others. No book in the world is long enough to put them all in--unless we do a sequel, of course.Amazon.com:Do you thinkThe Dangerous Book for Boysis being read by actual boys, or only by nostalgic adults? Have you seen boys getting up from their Xboxes to go outside and perform first aid or tan animal skins or build go-carts?Iggulden:I've had a lot of emails and letters from boys who loved the book--as well as fathers. I've had responses from kids as young as ten and an old man of 87, who pointed out a problem with the shadow stick that we've since changed. The thing to remember is that we may be older and more cynical every year, but boys simply aren't. If they are given the chance to make a go-cart with their dad, they jump at it. Mine did. Nothing gives me more pleasure than to know the book is being used with fathers and sons together, trying things out. Nothing is more valuable to a boy than time with his dad, learning something fun--or something difficult. That's part of the attitude too. If it's hard, you don't make it easy, you grab it by the throat and hang on for as long as it takes.The book is often bought by fathers, of course. Their sons don't know Scott of the Antarctic is a great adventure story. How could they if it isn't taught any more? Good, heroic stories don't appear much in modern school curriculums--and then we wonder why boys don't seem interested.Amazon.com:And finally, on to the important questions: Should Pluto still be a planet? And what was the best dinosaur?Iggulden:Pluto is a planet. I know there are scientists who say it isn't, but it's big enough to be round and it has a moon, for crying out loud. Of course it's a planet. Give it ten years and they'll be agreeing with me again.As for the best dinosaur, it depends what you mean by best. For sheer perfection, it probably has to be the shark and the crocodile. Modern ones are smaller but their record for sheer survival is pretty impressive. I only hope humanity can do as well. The only thing that will stop us is worrying too much.",

TV writer Meena Harper creates fabulous plots for Insatiable, the second-highest&ndash;rated soap opera, thanks to her burdensome if lucrative psychic ability to see into the future and determine how people are going to die. And just as Insatiable is switching to a vampire theme to attract a younger demographic, a spate of chilling murders-by-exsanguination grips New York City. Enter Lucien Antonescu, a sexy, melancholic Romanian history professor/vampire who recognizes that the murders are the work of rogue vampires who have broken away from his order. (Lucien happens to be the son of Vlad the Impaler, whom Bram Stoker gave such a bad rep.) Lucien's opposition: Alaric Wulf, a sympathetic detective from the Palatine Guard, who hopes to use Meena and her prophetic gift to stop the murders and track down Lucien. Unfortunately for Alaric, Meena is a little in love with Lucien. Cabot is less concerned with creating a convincing family tree for Lucien than with creating sparks between her characters, who feel pleasantly natural even as they live alongside the vampires next door.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0060873027": "Amazon Exclusive: &ldquo;Microis Anything But Small&rdquo; by James RollinsAn avid spelunker and scuba enthusiast,James Rollinsholds a doctorate in veterinary medicine  and is the author of theNew York Timesbest-selling Sigma Force series, the most recent of which isThe Devil Colony.First I have to admit, Michael Crichton is why I write.  In fact, if not for his books, I&rsquo;d probably still be a practicing veterinarian in Northern California, dealing with flea allergies, ear infections, and all manner of medical maladies.  It was Crichton&rsquo;s stories of wild adventures, his explorations into the strange frontiers of science, and his truly ripped-from-the-headlines plotting that inspired me to set down my own scalpel and stethoscope and pick up pen and paper.But his influence went beyond mere heady inspiration.  His books also served as a tutorial into the practicalities of storytelling.  When I tackled my first novel (a deep-earth adventure titledSubterranean), I continually kept a copy ofJurassic Parkon the shelf above my desk.  That book became my roadmap on how to build a story&rsquo;s structure:  who dies first and when, at what point do we see the first dinosaur, how do you fold science into a novel without stagnating the flow?  That old copy ofJurassic Parkremains dog-eared and heavily highlighted, and it still holds a cherished place on my bookshelf.So I dove into Crichton&rsquo;s latest novel,Micro, with some trepidation, fearing how a collaborative effort might tarnish his great body of work.  Now, to be fair, I&rsquo;d also read Richard Preston&rsquo;s nonfiction masterpiece of scientific horror and intrigue,The Hot Zone.  That book was as brilliant as it was terrifying.  But still I wondered, could Preston take Crichton&rsquo;s story and truly do it justice?In a word:YES.In two words,HELL YES.Microis pure Crichton.   Dare I say,vintageCrichton, harkening back to the scientific intrigue ofAndromeda Strain, to the exploration of the natural world covered inCongo, and to the adventure and thrills ofThe Lost World.   As only Crichton can, he has taken a scientific concept as wild as the one he tackled inTimelineand exceeded in making it chillingly real.  It took a clever quirk of genetics and cloning to give rise to the dinosaurs inJurassic Park.  Likewise, a twist of science in Micro calls forth a new horror out of the natural world&mdash;but not just one line of threat.  In this book, the entire biosphere becomes a vast and deadly playground.  Its depiction is both darkly beautiful and stunningly dreadful.  It is a terrain as foreign as any hostile planet, yet as close as our own backyard.  To tell more would ruin a great adventure that will have you looking out your window with new eyes.Similarly, this lethal and toxic terrain must be traversed by a band of gutsy heroes.  But in typical Crichton style, these are not elite commandos or a highly trained black ops team.  They&rsquo;re simply a group of graduate students&mdash;each uniquely talented and flawed&mdash;gathered from various scientific disciplines:  entomology, toxicology, botany, biochemistry.  They must learn to combine resources and ingenuities to survive and ultimately thwart a danger threatening to break free into the world at large, all the while pursued by a sociopath as cunning as he is sadistic.In the end,Microhas everything you&rsquo;d expect in a Crichton novel&mdash;and so much more.  But the greatest achievement here is a simple and profound one:  with this novel, the legacy of a true master continues to shine forth in all its multifaceted glory.  And someone somewhere will read this novel, turn the last page, and in a great aura of awe and inspiration, come to a realization:I want to try to write stories like that.And they will.",

Massoud Amir Behrani, a former colonel in the Iranian military under the Shah, reflects on his  job-search efforts since arriving in the U.S. four years before: \"I have spent hundreds of dollars copying my credentials; I have worn my French suits and my Italian shoes to hand-deliver my qualifications; I have waited and then called back after the correct waiting time; but there is nothing.\"  The father of two, Behrani has spent most of the money he brought with him from Iran on an apartment and furnishings that are too expensive, desperately trying to keep up appearances in order to enhance his daughter's chances of making a good marriage. Now the daughter is married, and on impulse he sinks his remaining funds into a house he buys at auction, thus unwittingly putting himself and his family on a trajectory to disaster. The house, it seems, once belonged to Kathy Nicolo, a self-destructive alcoholic who wants it back. What starts out as a legal tussle soon escalates into a personal confrontation--with dire results.Dubus tells his tragic tale from the viewpoints of the two main adversaries, Behrani and Kathy. To both of them, the house represents something more than just a place to live. For the colonel, it is a foot in the door of the American dream; for Kathy, a reminder of a kinder, gentler past.

As one of five distinct character types, players explore the world ofDiablo II, journey across distant lands, fight new villains, discover new treasures, and uncover ancient mysteries. Since the beginning of time, the forces of order and chaos have been engaged in an eternal struggle to decide the fate of all creation. That struggle has now come to the mortal realm, and neither man, demon, nor angel will be left unscathed. Diablo, lord of terror and youngest of the three prime evils, awakes from his long sleep beneath the dark earth. Setting in motion a grand scheme to free his exiled brothers, Mephisto and Baal, Diablo takes control of the small western kingdom of Khanduras. Working from deep within the ancient catacombs beneath the town of Tristram, Diablo grips the entire populace in a blanket of fear and paranoia. Ultimately, as even Khanduras's good King Leoric falls under Diablo's wicked power, a lone hero arises to challenge the darkness that engulfs the land. After plumbing the hellish depths of the labyrinth under Tristram, the nameless hero finally confronts the lord of terror himself. Knowing full well that Diablo's spirit can never be truly destroyed, the hero makes the noblest sacrifice of all--casting his soul and his very sanity aside, he takes the spirit of Diablo into himself, hoping that his own strength of will can contain the demon within. The hero doesn't realize that his selfless act will not only ensure Diablo's victory, but will also irrevocably damn his soul for all time.",

Except I shamefully tried to do exactly that in our last interview, which was about you and your fabulousMaybe This Time, which was such a delicious read that I devoured it in one evening. Truly. It was better than chocolate, so funny and heartwarming, which, let&rsquo;s face it, is a hard task for even the most gifted writer to pull off, but you did it, babe, and I have no idea why I tried to sabotage that interview. I&rsquo;m ashamed.Back to me. So go ahead. Ask me some questions. Make them easy. I&rsquo;m not half as smart as you. But I&rsquo;ll put my banana bread up against yours any day.Love,SusanA Letter from Jennifer Crusie to Susan Elizabeth PhillipsDear Susan,My banana bread leaves your banana bread sniveling in the pan from its inadequacy. However, I might write another book again someday and then you&rsquo;ll owe ME an interview, so I won&rsquo;t mention that. HA. And I will be Adult and not make the interview about me.Love,JennyAmazon Exclusive: Jennifer Crusie Interviews Susan Elizabeth PhillipsJennifer Crusie:Welcome to Jennifer Crusie&rsquo;s interview with her Close Personal Friend, Susan Elizabeth Phillips. I&rsquo;m Jenny Crusie and I&rsquo;m thrilled to be interviewing Susan because she&rsquo;s not only my Close Personal Friend, she&rsquo;s also the Queen of Romantic Comedy! Oh, and because she has a new book coming out. And because that&rsquo;s what Close Personal Friends do.  So Susan, tell us aboutMaybe This Time.Susan Elizabeth Phillips:Sigh&hellip; Once you tell your Close Personal Friend how much you love her book, she never lets you forget it.JC:Sorry, sorry, I meantCall Me Irresistible. What was I thinking?  Probably that &ldquo;irresistible&rdquo; is a bitch to spell, unlike &ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; &ldquo;This,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Time.&rdquo; So you have a new novel coming out FINALLY. Not that I&rsquo;ve been impatient or anything, but ye gods, woman, you have fans and none of us are getting any younger. What took you so long? And when do I get my Close Personal Friend of Susan Elizabeth Phillips copy?SEP:So glad you pointed out the difficulty of spelling &ldquo;irresistible.&rdquo;  Where was my brain? As for taking so long&hellip; Writing is hard! Didn&rsquo;t anybody ever tell you that? (An advanced copy of the book is coming to you in the mail. Along with a truly superb loaf of banana bread.)JC:Sorry, sorry, I&rsquo;m just thrilled thatCall Me Irresistibleis coming out. Finally. For one thing, I get to see some of my favorite characters again like Meg fromWhat I Did for Loveand Lucy fromFirst Lady, not to mention Ted fromFancy PantsandLady Be Good. Is it fun for you to revisit them? (Not that I care, it&rsquo;s fun for me, so bring them back anyway, that&rsquo;s what I say.) Oh, and will readers have to have read all those books to understand this one? Because if so, good marketing.SEP:I love revisiting old characters. Just like revisiting old friends. (Not that we&rsquo;re old. Or even remotely mature.) The thing about my books is that they all stand alone, even those with familiar characters. And, boy, doesCall Me Irresistiblehave a lot of familiar characters. If readers want to pick up the older books, more power to them. But they don&rsquo;t have to. That would be like homework. Except more fun.JC:You remember back when I told you not to marry Charles and you got all huffy about it? Meg does the same thing to Lucy in this book and she listens. What kind of heroine tries to break up her pal&rsquo;s wedding? (Tell Charles I said hi.)SEP:My husband&rsquo;s name is Bill, not Charles. (This interview isn&rsquo;t going nearly as well as I&rsquo;d hoped.) Meg, the heroine ofCall Me Irresistible, sees clearly what Lucy Jorik, the bride, can&rsquo;t&mdash;that Lucy and Ted Beaudine aren&rsquo;t the perfect match everyone believes them to be. Lucy flees her wedding just as she&rsquo;s supposed to be saying, &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; leaving Meg to face the wrath of Wynette, Texas&hellip; and Ted Beaudine.JC:Okay, the last time I saw Ted he was a kid, so his appeal as a leading man wasn&rsquo;t evident (cute, though) but now he sounds like The Perfect Man: a civic minded, athletic, sweet, rich genius. Did Meg turn into superwoman in between books to earn this paragon? Because I&rsquo;m feeling inadequate enough without having to live up to a Perfect Heroine.SEP:Not to worry. As you pointed out, Ted really does have it all: looks, money, charm, and that annoying genius I.Q. As for Meg&hellip; Unlike our sexy paragon of a hero, Meg is so deliciously imperfect. Kind of a screw-up, although her heart&rsquo;s in the right place. She also has big problems. She&rsquo;s broke, stranded, and unemployed in a town where everybody&rsquo;s out to get her&hellip;and where Ted Beaudine holds all the power.JC:What is it with you and Texans? Not that I have anything against Texas except, you know, politics, but you&rsquo;re practically a tumbleweed groupie. Did you have a great one-night stand there that you&rsquo;ve never quite let go of? Did you look across a room and meet the eyes of a tall, dark ranger and then Charles made you play golf? Because your erotic fascination with that state is well-documented. Give us all the details. And pictures. Pictures or it didn&rsquo;t happen.SEP:My husband&rsquo;s name is NOT CHARLES, it&rsquo;s BILL! And who are you calling a groupie? I seem to remember a certain wild night, a certain famous rocker&hellip; I&rsquo;ll say no more. As for my Texas settings&mdash;and no offense to my Lone Star friends&mdash;but that state is a writer&rsquo;s dream. You can make any dang fool thing happen in Texas and readers will believe it. Thank you Sam Houston and all your fine descendents.JC:I never had a chance to be a groupie once you told him I threw rolls at you. You asked me some really good questions in our last Amazon interview (smart, talented, and beautiful; you really do have it all, oh Queen of the RomCom), so I&rsquo;m throwing two of the best back at you: &ldquo;How do the stories you want to tell now differ from the ones you wanted to tell when you started writing? How are they the same?&rdquo;SEP:Do I detect a little sarcasm with all these Queen references? I should never have borrowed your tiara. Great, insightful questions, by the way! (Please don&rsquo;t bring up the roll incident.) My core story will, I think, always be the same. I love books that make me laugh and get a lump in my throat, sometimes on the same page. I love sexy heroes, funny heroines, and happy endings. Basically, there&rsquo;s not much difference between what I used to write and what I write now. Except now I&rsquo;m a lot better speller.JC:Thank you, Susan for these insightful and fascinating answers.  And now for our last question: WHAT&rsquo;S NEXT?  Tell me all about what you&rsquo;re working on so I can harass you so you can finish it faster and I can read it. And because I&rsquo;m a pal, proofread it.SEP:I&rsquo;m not giving too much away by saying that, by page thirty ofCall Me Irresistible, Lucy Jorik has fled her wedding, and we don&rsquo;t see her again for the rest of the book. Leaving us to wonder&hellip; Exactly what happened to our runaway bride?",

In Raiden's case it was a victory over Shao Kahn, while Superman bested Darkseid. These occurred at the exact same time and involved inter-dimensional elements, which somehow merged their two enemies into one being, Dark Kahn, while allowing the characters of the two universes to interact. In this merging the powers of the heroes and villains are scrambled as well, making some stronger than they ever were, and leaving others vulnerable for the first time in their lives, allowing each to battle on more or less equal footing. And battle they do without realizing that the uncontrollable rage that they feel for each other is actually the work of Dark Khan.GameplayMortal Kombat vs. DC Universebeing a fighter, gameplay consists of one-on-one battles, both in local play and online, in which players can choose a character from either side who will face off against a counterpart from the other. Each character has unique attacks and special finishing moves, and fighting arenas vary depending on whether your character comes from theMortal Kombator DC universe. Keeping with the reputation for brutality in theMortal Kombatfranchise, characters from this side will have access to fatalities, while the historically less overly violent DC characters will execute \"heroic brutalities,\" which are end moves where the opponent while beaten, is not killed. The game also features new gameplay mechanics such as: Freefall Kombat, in which players can engage in extended combat while in midair; Klose Kombat, during which the play angle moves to a close-up view of the action; The Test Your Might mini-game where you smash your opponent through walls; and Rage Mode, which increases the power of a character's attack by 50% and provides protection against being stunned by an opponent.Playable CharactersPlayable characters inMortal Kombat vs. DC Universeconsist of some of the most popular heroes and villains from both universes, with most being available from the beginning of the game and some unlockable throughout.

Frank Baum'sTheWonderful Wizard of Oz \"occupies a unique position in the cultural fabric of this country.\" Editor Peter Glassman (Oz: The HundredthAnniversary Celebration) calls the story \"quintessentially American.\" Yet it has a universal appeal--which may account for its translation into many different languages. Although children are often first introduced to the Land of Oz by the classic 1939 movie, the original novel and its many sequels have enchanted both young and old over the years. Published for the centennial, several new books commemorate the beloved story. Readers unacquainted with Oz are sure to find a pleasing version; readers who already know the story will find something to delight them all over again.InOz: The Hundredth Anniversary Celebration,Peter Glassman presents art and words from children's book authors and illustrators who are big fans of Oz and here pay homage to \"the enchanted land that inspired them and helped shape their imaginations.\" The paintings, in each artist's recognizable style, lovingly convey the essence of Oz, making this truly wonderful. Contributions come from Tomie dePaola, who imagines himself going down the yellow brick road instead of Dorothy; Paul O. Zelinsky, who shared the Oz experience with his children; Uri Shulevitz, who escaped from hunger and war during the 1940s in the pages ofThe Wonderful Wizard of Oz; Richard Egielski, whose childhood defense against the ghastly flying monkeys was to lie absolutely still in bed; Natalie Babbitt, Peter Sis, Bruce Degen, Lloyd Alexander, and many others. Proceeds from the sale of the book will be donated to Reading Is Fundamental (RIF).Then there's Robert Sabuda's extraordinary pop-up version. On the first double-page spread, the fearful cyclone whirls up to loom over the tiny farm house in Kansas; in the next spread, the house stands squarely on top of the Wicked Witch of the East. And so it goes, spread after spread. The story itself is condensed and told on foldout booklets attached to the pages. The standout pop-ups are prints created from cut blocks of linoleum, with sparkling touches of colored foil that add pizzazz. Sabuda's art evokes that of Denslow, including the silver, rather than ruby, slippers, and once again, his mastery of his craft enhances and enchants. A good selection for story hours.Also now available is Henry Holt's reissue of its 1982 version of the book, with artwork by the well-known children's book illustrator Michael Hague. It contains several new pictures and a slightly longer profile of Baum. It's certainly not an essential purchase, but it's a gorgeous edition for collections that don't have the earlier volume.Last, but certainly not least, isThe Wonderful Wizard of Oz,the \"100th Anniversary Edition,\" part of the HarperCollins Books of Wonder imprint. For those who want the look and feel of the 1900 publication, this fills the bill. It's a very handsome facsimile, printed on high-quality paper and containing all of W. W. Denslow's 24 original colorplates and 130 two-color drawings. Long live Dorothy and her stalwart companions.Sally EstesCopyright &#169; American Library Association. All rights reserved",

Juneau is training to be the next Sage and strengthening her mystical abilities. When her entire clan is kidnapped, she sets out to find them. She soon learns that men are searching for her, and she struggles to stay one step ahead of them while acclimating to modern civilization for the first time. In a parallel narrative, Miles, the son of one of Juneau's pursuers, decides to track her himself, hoping to impress his father. The fast-paced plot, rife with mystery, successfully moves the story forward. The initial setting of Juneau's camp is fully realized and portrayed in vivid detail. She is a tough, loyal, and smart protagonist and thoroughly developed while Miles is more two-dimensional. A romance develops between them, but some teens may question Juneau's interest in Miles, who is egocentric and has few redeeming qualities. Some plot devices feel contrived, straining readers' abilities to suspend disbelief, and the number of conveniently fortuitous coincidences may raise an eyebrow or two. Ultimately, however, the unique premise, strong protagonist, and action-packed story redeem the work. Fans of postapocalyptic fiction will enjoy this unusual not-quite-dystopian novel with a dose of corporate espionage.

She starts a weekly knitting class, hoping to improve business and make friends in the area. The initial class project is a baby blanket, and Macomber (Changing Habits), a knitter herself who offers tips about the craft and pithy observations from knitting professionals throughout the novel, includes the knitting pattern at the start of the book. Well-heeled Jacqueline Donovan, who chooses to ignore her empty marriage, disguises her disdain for her pregnant daughter-in-law by knitting a baby blanket. Carol Girard joins the group as an affirmation of her hopes to finally have a successful in vitro pregnancy. Alix Townsend, a high school dropout with an absentee father and a mother incarcerated for forging checks, uses the class to satisfy a court-ordered community service sentence for a drug-possession conviction for which her roommate is really responsible. Unfortunately, Macomber doesn't get much below the surface of her characters, and, although they all have interesting back stories, the arc of each individual happy ending is too predictable. The only surprise involves Alix's hapless, overweight roommate, Laurel, and even this smacks of plot-driven manipulation. Macomber is an adept storyteller overall, however, and many will be entertained by this well-paced story about four women finding happiness and fulfillment through their growing friendships.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0061340324": "Travel writer Hislop's unwieldy debut novel opens with 25-year-old Alexis leaving Britain for Crete, her mother Sofia's homeland, hoping to ferret out the secrets of Sofia's past and thereby get a handle on her own turbulent life. Sofia's friend Fortini tells Alexis of her grandmother Anna, and great-aunt Maria. Their mother (Alexis's great-grandmother) contracted leprosy in 1939 and went off to a leper colony on the nearby island of Spinalonga, leaving them with their father. Anna snags a wealthy husband, Andreas, but smolders for his renegade cousin, Manoli. When philanderer Manoli chooses Maria, Anna is furious. Conveniently, Maria also contracts leprosy and is exiled, allowing Anna to conduct an affair with Manoli. Meanwhile, Maria feels an attraction to her doctor, who may have similar feelings. Though the plot is satisfyingly twisty, the characters play one note apiece (Anna is prone to dramatic outrages, Maria is humble and kind, and their love interests are jealous and aggressive). Hislop's portrayal of leprosy&mdash;those afflicted and the evolving treatment&mdash;during the 1940s and 1950s is convincing, but readers may find the narrative's preoccupation with chronicling the minutiae of daily life tedious.(July)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Taylor Markham, a 17-year-old who was abandoned years ago by her mother, takes on leadership of the boarding school's six Houses. Plagued with doubts about being boss, she's not sure she can handle her Cadet counterpart, Jonah Griggs, whom she met several years before while running away to find her mother. When Hannah, a sort of house mother who has taken Taylor under her wing, disappears, Taylor puzzles over the book manuscript the woman left behind. Hannah's tale involves a tragic car accident on the Jellicoe Road more than 20 years earlier. Only three children survived, and Taylor discovers that this trio, plus a Cadet and a Townie, developed an epic friendship that was the foundation of the many mysteries in her life and identity, as well as of the war games. While the novel might put off casual readers, patient, thoughtful teens will remain to extract clues from the interwoven scraps of Hannah's narrative, just as Taylor does, all the while seeing the collapse of the barriers erected among the three groups over the years. Elegiac passages and a complex structure create a somewhat dense, melancholic narrative with elements of romance, mystery, and realistic fiction.&mdash;Suzanne Gordon, Peachtree Ridge High School, Suwanee, GACopyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0099458322": "The opening pages of a Haruki Murakami novel can be like the view out an airplane window onto tarmac. But at some point between page three and  fifteen--it's page thirteen inKafka On The Shore--the deceptively placid narrative lifts off, and you find yourself breaking through clouds at a tilt, no longer certain where the plane is headed or if the laws of flight even apply.Joining the rich literature of runaways,Kafka On The Shorefollows the solitary, self-disciplined schoolboy Kafka Tamura as he hops a bus from Tokyo to the randomly chosen town of Takamatsu, reminding himself at each step that he has to be \"the world&#xB9;s toughest fifteen-year-old.\" He finds a secluded private library in which to spend his days--continuing his impressive self-education--and is befriended by a clerk and the mysteriously remote head librarian, Miss Saeki, whom he fantasizes may be his long-lost mother. Meanwhile, in a second, wilder narrative spiral, an elderly Tokyo man named Nakata veers from his calm routine by murdering a stranger. An unforgettable character, beautifully delineated by Murakami, Nakata can speak with cats but cannot read or write, nor explain the forces drawing him toward Takamatsu and the other characters.To say that the fantastic elements ofKafka On The Shoreare complicated and never fully resolved is not to suggest that the novel fails. Although it may not live up to Murakami's masterfulThe Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, Nakata and Kafka's fates keep the reader enthralled to the final pages, and few will complain about the loose threads at the end.--Regina Marler--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

Age 26 at the time and feeling lost and desperate after indulging in the excesses of the 1960s, the Jewish author had no real hope for inspiration from the course because of its Christian terminology. But, she writes in this guide to the guide, the program works \"miracles\" for herself and for others who adopt its principles. Her extrapolations may appeal to readers in need of spiritual sustenance, but one questions Williamson's advice to the gravely ill. When she encourages them, for example, to \"write a letter to AIDS or cancer or whatever illness they might have, and tell it everything they feel\"--even to fabricate \"replies\" from the disease--readers are likely to consider that a serious situation is trivialized.

In 1818, the notorious Vidocq, a master detective who's rumored to work on both sides of the law, pulls 26-year-old Parisian doctor Hector Carpentier into a torture-murder inquiry. The victim, Chr&eacute;tien Leblanc, died without revealing that he was on his way to visit Carpentier, news that comes as a complete shock to the doctor, as the dead man was a stranger to him. Vidocq soon discovers that Leblanc was actually in search of Carpentier's late father, who bore the same name. The elder Carpentier cared for Louis-Charles, Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette's young son, who died in prison in 1795. Bayard keeps the reader guessing until the end, though the puzzle aspect is less prominent than in his previous novel,The Pale Blue Eye, which featured Edgar Allan Poe as sleuth.

Late one evening, as Stone trudges home from Elaine's Restaurant, popular TV newscaster Sasha Nijinsky plummets 12 stories from her terrace and lands on a heap of dirt 20 yards away from him--remarkably, still alive. Stone fails to apprehend the person who flees Sasha's penthouse and, after the ambulance carrying her collides with a fire truck, Sasha herself disappears. Despite the fact that no corpse is in evidence, the baffled NYPD eagerly pins a murder rap on Sasha's distraught lesbian lover. Stone refuses to accept his colleagues' pat solution and even maintains that Sasha might have survived thanks to skydiving training and her billowing, parachute-like robe. Bed-hopping TV newspeople, a sexy blonde judge sporting a red dress beneath her robes, a serial killer targeting cabbies and a creepy med-school dropout turned mortician who idolizes Sasha romp through this calculatedly melodramatic crime story all the way to its grisly B-movie finale. 75,000 first printing; $125,000 ad/promo; author tour.Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

The story centers on Vietnam veteran George Washington Hayduke III, who returns to the desert to find his beloved canyons and rivers threatened by industrial development. On a rafting trip down the Colorado River, Hayduke joins forces with feminist saboteur Bonnie Abbzug, wilderness guide Seldom Seen Smith, and billboard torcher Doc Sarvis, M.D., and together they wander off to wage war on the big yellow machines, on dam builders and road builders and strip miners. As they do, his characters voice Abbey's concerns about wilderness preservation (\"Hell of a place to lose a cow,\" Smith thinks to himself while roaming through the canyonlands of southern Utah. \"Hell of a place to lose your heart. Hell of a place... to lose. Period\").

That was when I picked up a paperback original calledSubterranean, Rollins' first book.   While I was struggling even to write a manuscript, this veterinarian out in California had actually done it and sold the thing.  I hated him.  Over the next few years, I would wander into a bookstore and discover that the 'vet from Sacramento' had written more stories.  I read them all, titles likeIce Hunt,Amazonia, andExcavationand hated him even more.  There I was, struggling to get published, and this guy had found the big time.I finally made it to print in 2003 and, sure enough, who's my chief competition?  You got it.  James Rollins.  The guy creates Sigma Force and writes  oneNew York Timesbestseller after another.  Titles likeMap of Bones,Black Order,The Last Oracle, andThe Judas Strain.   Amazingly, while this string of Rollins' books flooded bookstores, I managed to eke out some modest success.  But every time things started going right, here came that 'vet from California' again with another book.Occasionally, I'm asked to provide a quote or two for someone else's book.  I can't tell you how many times my words of praise languish on the back cover while Rollins' is front and center.  Rollins.  Rollins.  Rollins.  That's all I hear.  Even on Amazon, in the section titled \"Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought,\" ON MY BOOK PAGES, there's always a Rollins cover or two staring back at me from the screen.And, if things weren't bad enough, the 'vet from California' wrote another series.  Some character calledJake Ransom and The Skull King's Shadow.   It's not enough Rollins is everywhere in adult fiction (taking up valuable spots on the bestseller lists), now he has to claim a piece of the young adult pie, too.  I read that he's going to write more of those things.  Apparently, the first one did okay.  Like that was a big surprise.Which brings us toAltar of Eden, Rollins' latest concoction. Here he goes again, not satisfied with a thriller out in the summer, he has to publish another in the winter.  Which, by the way, directly competes with me (of course, Rollins doesn't care).  This new book has it all.   A savvy veterinarian (like that was a stretch), genetic engineering on long extinct animals (which was fascinating, I have to admit), fractal science (whatever that is), biological warfare (in ways you've never seen before), and mach-speed mayhem.   The thing is drum-tight in its execution.  Does this guy have herbs that stimulate his imagination in some amazing way?  I readAltar of Edenin two sittings (yeah, it's that good) and, when finished, I promptly hurled the book across the room.  It landed on the shelf where all of Rollins' other tomes stand, each sheathed in plastic, first editions, and, of course, signed (for which he charged me $5.00 a piece, cash.  He wouldn't take my check).'Oh, the humanity.'I barely bang out a-book-a-year and Rollins writes three.All of them great.Like I said, I hate this guy.Which is too bad, because he's not only a terrific writer but also a close friend.",

You are immediately presented with certain life tasks, such as fixing the TV and making lunch, which are aligned with the skills you'll need for the game's main challenge--keeping your sims in balance on eight conflicting categories. For example, eating will have an impact on your sim's hunger rating, but it will also impact his bladder rating. You'll have to make sure that he keeps himself and the house clean, that he sleeps to restore his energy, and that he also has time to keep himself entertained.

You direct their actions by moving a line cursor to where you want them to go or to what object or person with which you want them to interact.The game is surprisingly funny.

Fast food is so ubiquitous that it now seems as American, and harmless, as apple pie. But the industry's drive for consolidation, homogenization, and speed has radically transformed America's diet, landscape, economy, and workforce, often in insidiously destructive ways. Eric Schlosser, an award-winning journalist, opens his ambitious and ultimately devastating expos&eacute; with an introduction to the iconoclasts and high school dropouts, such as Harlan Sanders and the McDonald brothers, who first applied the principles of a factory assembly line to a commercial kitchen. Quickly, however, he moves behind the counter with the overworked and underpaid teenage workers, onto the factory farms where the potatoes and beef are grown, and into the slaughterhouses run by giant meatpacking corporations. Schlosser wants you to know why those French fries taste so good (with a visit to the world's largest flavor company) and \"what really lurks between those sesame-seed buns.\" Eater beware: forget your concerns about cholesterol, there is--literally--feces in your meat.Schlosser's investigation reaches its frightening peak in the meatpacking plants as he reveals the almost complete lack of federal oversight of a seemingly lawless industry. His searing portrayal of the industry is disturbingly similar to Upton Sinclair'sThe Jungle, written in 1906: nightmare working conditions, union busting, and unsanitary practices that introduceE. coliand other pathogens into restaurants, public schools, and homes. Almost as disturbing is his description of how the industry \"both feeds and feeds off the young,\" insinuating itself into all aspects of children's lives, even the pages of their school books, while leaving them prone to obesity and disease. Fortunately, Schlosser offers some eminently practical remedies. \"Eating in the United States should no longer be a form of high-risk behavior,\" he writes. Where to begin?

In an almost offhand manner, he writes about seeing and doing things that would wilt the flower of courage in almost any reader. \"Was I proud to be enlisting,\" he rhetorically ponders at one point, \"on our side in the Cold War?

Computer-controlled opponents benefit from enhanced artificial intelligence; they don't act like baby ducks following their mother, but instead respond to other cars, the course, and the conditions in much the same way that real drivers would. Pressure a car, and it will pressure you back; cut one off in the early part of the race, and expect to receive similar treatment down the course. They don't drive perfectly, either; some will spin out and make other mistakes over the course of a race.",
        "0061825867": "In his first book, Achorn, an editor at theProvidence Journal, takes an in-depth look into the game of baseball when it was still in its infancy, especially the hard-nosed players rarely seen in today's incarnation of the national pastime, including one of the greatest pitchers that most of today's fans know nothing about. In the 1884 season, pitching for Providence, R.I., Radbourn&mdash;the son of English immigrants&mdash;endured one of the most grueling summers imaginable in willing his team to the pennant. The stress on his right arm, which caused such deterioration that he couldn't comb his own hair, also gave him a baseball record of 59 wins that will never be broken, in a year of unparalleled brilliance. Achorn wonderfully captures this era of the sport&mdash;when pitchers threw balls at batters' heads, and catchers, playing barehanded, endured such abuse that some would need fingers amputated. It's no wonder that, in some circles, as Achorn writes, baseball was thought to be one degree above grand larceny, arson, and mayhem, and those who engaged in it were beneath the notice of decent society. From the early stars of the game to archaic rules that seem silly by today's standards, there's plenty to devour (and learn) for even the biggest of baseball savants.(Mar.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Although the Arkham asylum is well fortified, he has a nagging feeling that all is not well, which proves to be the case when seconds after turning The Joker over to the guards, the master criminal breaks free of his captors. Even more surprising than this quick turn of events is the revelation that it was never The Joker's intent to escape the vault-like facility, but instead to trap Batman there. Surrounded by an asylum full of dangerous criminals, many of which he put there and all at the beck and call of the Joker, can Batman survive and discover what is behind the Joker's intricate plot?GameplayInBatman: Arkham Asylumplayers strap on the gadget-heavy utility belt of the Caped Crusader. Gameplay here is a combination of both the knuckle crunching rush of hand to hand combat as you take on the hordes of thugs that infest Arkham Asylum, and stealth gameplay in which you must dispatch individuals from the shadows. Players can expect an engrossing single player campaign in which Batman continually moves forward to face the henchmen, bosses and traps that The Joker has set for him. With regards to opponents, in addition to The Joker who you will hear more than you see, the dark walls of Arkham also hold familiar villains from the the Batman criminal universe including Harley Quinn, Victor Zsasz and Killer Croc, that you will have to deal with, but don't expect a one-dimensional experience. As players progress from environment to environment within Arkham they will have to use varying combinations of muscle, detective skills, gadgetry and a certain degree of light RPG-like leveling of Batman's skills, arsenal and physical characteristics to survive and discover what The Joker's underlying scheme is.In addition to the story-driven single player campaignArkham Asylumalso contains various additional play modes. These include an arcade styled combat mode where players accumulate points by engaging hordes of thugs in a hand to hand slugfest across a series of maps, in which Batman's physical strength and agility play a major role. The key here is to chain together as many attacks as possible due to the fact that with each successful combo players increase the point multiplier associated with their actions. The game also features a time-based stealth mode where players must hone their ability to strike silently from the shadows. This gameplay, referred to as 'Invisible Predator' utilizes the Dark Knight's skill with gadgets like the grapple tool, batarang and explosives. These allow for vertical/horizontal mobility, the ability to quickly strike from above and at a distance and to take out enemies and create distractions, even through walls. But remember that Batman works solo and is not superhuman. Your enemies will congregate around trouble areas and work as a team against you, so you must be silent, plan your attacks wisely, strike quickly and discover the value of encouraging fear within enemies.Key FeaturesExperience the game in a whole new way with Game of the Year Edition extras including: Access to the playable Joker character (in the PS3 version only) and 4 additional standard challenge maps.Utilize the unique FreeFlow combat system to chain together unlimited combos seamlessly and battle with huge groups of The Joker's henchmen in brutal melee brawls.Investigate as Batman, the world's greatest detective, by solving intricate puzzles with the help of cutting edge forensic tools including x-ray scanning, fingerprint scans, 'Amido Black' spray and a pheromone tracker.Face off against Gotham's greatest villains including The Joker, Harley Quinn, Victor Zsasz and Killer Croc.Become the Invisible Predator with Batman's fear takedowns and unique vantage point system to move without being seen and hunt enemies.Choose multiple takedown methods, including swooping from the sky and smashing through walls, and use the predator camera get a closer look at the action.Explore every inch of Arkham Asylum and roam freely on the infamous island, presented for the first time ever in its gritty and realistic entirety.Experience what it's like to be Batman using batarangs, explosive gel aerosol, the Batclaw, sonar resonator and the line launcher.Unlock more secrets by completing hidden challenges in the world and develop and customize equipment by earning experience points.Enjoy complete superhero freedom in the environment with the use of Batman's grapple to get to any place you can see, jump from any height and glide in any direction.",
        "0060554738": "Are you just another AFC (\"average frustrated chump\") trying to meet an HB (\"hot babe\")? How would you like to \"full-close\" with a Penthouse Pet of the Year? The answers, my friend, are in Neil Strauss's entertaining bookThe Game. Strauss was a self-described chick repellant--complete with large, bumpy nose, small, beady eyes, glasses, balding head, and, worst of all, painful shyness around women. He felt like \"half a man.\" That is, until a book editor asked him to investigate the community of pickup artists. Strauss's life was transformed. He spent two years bedding some fine chiquitas and studying with some of the North America's most suave gents--including the best of them all, the God of the pickup \"community,\" a man named Mystery.Mystery is an aspiring Toronto magician who charges $2,250 for a weekend pickup workshop. He is not much to look at: a cross between a vampire and a computer geek. But by using high-powered marketing techniques he's turned seduction into an effortless craft--even inventing his own vocabulary. His technique sounds like a car salesman's tip sheet: his main rule is FMAC--find, meet, attract, close. He employs the \"three-second rule\"--always approach a woman within three seconds of first seeing her in order to avoid getting shy. Other tricks: Intrigue a beautiful woman by pretending to be unaffected by her charm; also, never hit on a woman right away. Start with a disarming, innocent remark, like \"Do you think magic spells work?\" or \"Oh my god, did you see those two girls fighting outside?\" And finally, the most important characteristic of the pickup artist--smile.After two years, Strauss ends up becoming almost as successful as Mystery, but he comes to an important realization. His techniques were actually off-putting to the woman he ended up falling in love with. And they never prepared him for actually having a relationship. After a while, he ran out of one-liners and had to have a real conversation. Still,The Gameis a great read that may help some AFCs come out of their shells.--Alex Roslin",

        "B0002HTAYS": "The Simswas one of the most popular games ever made. In it, players micromanage the lives of a family of virtual people, or Sims, and influence their paths toward success or something akin to a nervous breakdown. Its open-ended blend of cartoonish behavior and everyday living is unique in an art form otherwise obsessed with carnage and sports. WithThe Sims 2, long-time fans now have a deeper game with lots of ways to customize and share their experiences. The game will also attract first-timers because the goal-oriented gameplay and the luridly fun starter families make it easier to get into the action right out of the box.Now Sims are born with the traits of their parents, families grow, and Sims grow old.The People in Your NeighborhoodThe game starts at the neighborhood level. Here you can create a housing development from scratch or start with one of three premade neighborhoods, each with its own theme. From there, you'll settle on a house and a family of Sims to control.Create your own Sim (above) or your own house (below) from scratch with advanced tools.Aside from the basic needs carried over from the previous game, Sims now have aspirations, wants, and fears. The wants and fears are the day-to-day things that occupy their minds, like wanting to see friends or get married and fearing death or being rejected for a kiss. Satisfy their wants, and they become more efficient at completing tasks you assign them. Realize their fears, and Sims become lethargic, cranky, and unresponsive to your commands. Aspirations are the big-picture things, like raising a family, becoming wealthy, and gaining knowledge. Succeed here and you'll be able to buy odd gifts for your Sim to improve his or her life, like a money tree that pays dividends or a \"fountain of youth\" water cooler.What Else Is New?Of course, you wouldn't be able to juggle all that if it weren't for the improved \"Free Will\" option, which makes it easier for Sims to fulfill their basic needs. The artificial intelligence of the game is noticeably improved; they won't turn on radios just as a family member is going to bed but, strangely, they do occasionally put their dishes on the floor.Another big change in the series is the concept of the lifespan. Now Sims are born with the traits of their parents, families grow, and Sims grow old. Not only does this go hand in hand with aspirations (growing up is the first aspiration that a baby Sim will have), it provides a limited time with which your Sims can achieve their goals.The Universal Control Panel helps you manage your Sim family.A Family AffairThe Sims 2not only lets you create just about any type of Sim in any type of family, build elaborate houses, and even create a neighborhood from scratch, but it also allows you to start the gamein medias res, with premade households. These families all have backstories that are smart spoofs of soap-opera plots--lots of scheming, romance, ghosts, and family fighting. Parents of teens shouldn't worry, though, because nudity is tastefully blurred out and \"woo-hoo\" between Sims takes place completely under the covers. The ESRB has given this a Teen rating. IfThe Sims 2were a film, it would likely land between PG and PG-13.The makers have included some nice tools to help share the universe you've created. For example, you can capture in-game stills and video to show friends the private moments, family interactions, and house parties of your Sims. You can even package a household to share as a blog or an album on a special Web site.The Sims 2is for patient gamers. Like life itself, the game is filled with mundane details, like getting ready for work and doing dishes. The game also demands a level of creativity from its players that the run-and-gun game genres wouldn't know what to do with. But those who stick with it will be rewarded with an absorbing, amusing diversion and a virtual family history that they've created themselves.--Porter B.

As the anniversary of the battle approaches, ancient politics and the present-day murder cause tensions between the trolls and dwarfs to boil. Though Koom Valley was a disaster for both sides, certain community leaders from each side have been spoiling for a rematch&mdash;something Vimes is duty-bound to prevent. In the midst of this, a push toward affirmative action forces Vimes to hire a vampire named Sally to the Watch. She's sworn off human blood, but that's cold comfort to the assortment of humans, dwarfs, trolls, werewolves and golems that make up the police force. Vimes and his motley crew of coppers are called upon to not only find the murderer and keep the peace but also, in a jab atThe Da Vinci Code, solve the riddle of a painting that reputedly holds the secret to what really happened at Koom Valley. Pratchett's fantastic imagination and satirical wit are on full display.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",
        "0099526409": "First published in 1970, this extraordinary book changed the way Americans think about the original inhabitants of their country. Beginning with the Long Walk of the Navajos in 1860 and ending 30 years later with the massacre of Sioux men, women, and children at Wounded Knee in South Dakota, it tells how the American Indians lost their land and lives to a dynamically expanding white society. During these three decades, America's population doubled from 31 million to 62 million. Again and again, promises made to the Indians fell victim to the ruthlessness and greed of settlers pushing westward to make new lives. The Indians were herded off their ancestral lands into ever-shrinking reservations, and were starved and killed if they resisted. It is a truism that \"history is written by the victors\"; for the first time, this book described the opening of the West from the Indians' viewpoint. Accustomed to stereotypes of Indians as red savages, white Americans were shocked to read the reasoned eloquence of Indian leaders and learn of the bravery with which they and their peoples endured suffering. With meticulous research and in measured language overlaying brutal narrative,Dee Brownfocused attention on a national disgrace. Still controversial but with many of its premises now accepted,Bury My Heart at Wounded Kneehas sold 5 million copies around the world. Thirty years after it first broke onto the national conscience, it has lost none of its importance or emotional impact.--John Stevenson--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

But fans ofGTA IIIshould note that  whileState of Emergencycontains adult themes and extremely violent  gameplay, that's pretty much where the similarities end. WhereasGTA IIIwas about creating a deep experience unlike any other video game,SOEis  a throwback to arcade beat-'em-ups likeSmash TVandDouble  Dragon. However, the game takes the genre to a new level with mind-blowing  graphics.InState of Emergency, you play as one of five selectable characters  that's going up against the Corporation--a tyrannical group that has the city in  an iron grip. The city is in a state of disarray and the citizens are rebelling.  Amazingly, up to 250 characters can riot onscreen at once. It's shocking that  the developers were able to render so many moving characters while keeping a  smooth frame rate. Basic gameplay consists of picking up numerous weapons and  objects to cause as much damage as humanly possible. Providing context to the  mindless violence are the revolution and chaos modes. The former is the game's  story mode and features more than 175 missions, while the latter is a  single-session mode with a few variations.For the most part, the game is an enjoyable cacophony of senseless violence, but  there are some flaws. Although the revolution mode boasts an impressive number  of missions, they do get repetitive. The game screams for a multiplayer mode,  but it's strictly one player. In spite of these flaws, the game remains  addictive and fun. It bears repeating that gamers looking for anotherGTA  IIIwill not find it here: this game provides an arcadelike experience  that's excellent, but in a very different way.

Elements replace magic and items in battle,  and using the same element three times in a row will ultimately increase  your power. In addition to using elements, the accuracy of physical  attacks is determined by probability, with easier-to-land weak attacks  setting up fierce blows.The plot, while a bit slow to develop, is full of interesting  characters.
