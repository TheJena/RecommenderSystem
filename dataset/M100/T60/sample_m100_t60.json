        "0061961175": "Starred Review. Here's one for the Southern gals as well as Yankees who appreciate Frank's signature mix of sass, sex, and gargantuan personalities. In this long-time-coming sequel toPlantation, opinionated and family-centric Caroline Wimbly Levine has just turned 47, but she's less concerned with advancing middle age than she is with son Eric shacking up with an older single mom. She's also dealing with a drunk and disorderly sister-in-law, Frances Mae; four nieces from hell; grieving brother Tripp; a pig-farmer boyfriend with a weak heart; and a serious crush on the local sheriff. Then there's Caroline's dead-but-not-forgotten mother, Miss Lavinia, whose presence both guides and troubles Caroline as she tries to keep her unruly family intact and out of jail. With a sizable cast of minor characters with major attitude, Frank lovingly mixes a brew of personalities who deliver nonstop clashes, mysteries, meltdowns, and commentaries; below the always funny theatrics, however, is a compelling saga of loss and acceptance. When Frank nails it, she really nails it, and she does so here.(June)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

        "0062118692": "Gr 9 Up-The survivors of the Switch are sealed within a domed city, dependent on oxygen supplied by the government according to their social status. Chapters rotate narration among freedom-fighter Alina, privileged Quinn, and empathetic Bea. Quinn and Bea are friends, but he doesn't notice her the way she wants to be noticed. A planned camping trip in which Bea hopes to gain his affection goes awry when beautiful Alina tags along. The relaxing getaway turns serious as the group tries to avoid government forces chasing Alina and heads for the safety of a rebel stronghold. Once at the base, the story hits its only sour note. The leader and her psychopathic, orphaned child sidekick are repulsive characters. Much of the sympathy for the rebels and their just cause evaporates in their leader's lunacy. Woven throughout the trio's perilous adventure to discover if the government has lied and humankind can survive outside the dome is a thoughtful romance. Secondary characters are fully realized. Pacing is quick, but allows the tension to build. While echoes of The Hunger Games lessen the originality of the story, it won't diminish readers' interest.-Cindy Wall, Southington Library & Museum, CT&#x3B1;(c) Copyright 2011.

        "0060513659": "This newest Regency-era romance from veteran author Medeiros (One Night of Scandal, etc.) starts out as a crisp, bright tale of a woman whose no-nonsense attentions revitalize a disabled lord, but a jarring plot twist sends the book into a black hole that might leave readers feeling disoriented and cheated. Earl and naval hero Gabriel Fairchild lost his sight, fallen-angel good looks and fianc&eacute;e after the battle of Trafalgar, only to acquire tart-tongued nurse Samantha Wickersham, a young woman with a shadowy past who refuses to let Gabriel sink into self-pity. As she teaches him how to navigate his mansion and regain his independence, he guides her along a journey of shared desire. But while Samantha gives Gabriel her heart, she keeps her secrets, vanishing when it becomes clear that Gabriel can finally survive without her assistance. Here the story staggers, revealing vital information hardly hinted at before. Then Samantha, who's cast as a straight shooter in the first half, inexplicably begins acting out of character, sending the final portion of the book into a spin that grows worse with every page. Though the first portion of the novel is as finely written as Medeiros's best novels, the ending proves to be a rough landing.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Nothing big, you understand, just enough to convince her pompous British suitor that she's not an eligible candidate for marriage.  She's thinking along the lines of, oh, maybe a discreet tattoo.  But when suspended Texas golf pro Kenny Traveler meets her plane at Dallas-Ft. Worth Airport, Emma decides that he's the perfect candidate to destroy her reputation.Kenny, on the other hand--who desperately wants to be reinstated on the golf tour--is just as determined to keep a low profile and remain squeaky-clean. If Lady Emma weren't a close personal friend of the golf commissioner's wife, he'd never have agreed to squire her around town. Unfortunately for Kenny, his weakness for the British beauty is growing daily, and it seems as though Emma may have feelings for him as well. In a bizarre turn of events, wild man Kenny finds himself trying to keep the prim and proper British lady from causing a scandal the size of which even the lone-star state has never seen, and the results will leave you laughing with delight.Below the hilarious dialogue that is Susan Elizabeth Phillips's trademark, Kenny, Emma, and the charming array of characters that populate this exceptional contemporary are warm and wonderfully human.  Emma saves her Kenny and he saves her right back--never were two people more gloriously deserving of each other.--Lois Faye Dyer--This text refers to theMass Market Paperbackedition.",
        "0061689246": "Stardustis an utterly charming fairy tale in the tradition ofThe Princess BrideandThe Neverending Story. Neil Gaiman, creator of the darkly elegant Sandman comics and author ofThe Day I Swapped My Dad for Two Goldfish, tells the story of young Tristran Thorn and his adventures in the land of Faerie. One fateful night, Tristran promises his beloved that he will retrieve a fallen star for her from beyond the Wall that stands between their rural English town (called, appropriately, Wall) and the Faerie realm. No one ever ventures beyond the Wall except to attend an enchanted flea market that is held every nine years (and during which, unbeknownst to him, Tristran was conceived). But Tristran bravely sets out to fetch the fallen star and thus win the hand of his love. His adventures in the magical land will keep you turning pages as fast as you can--he and the star escape evil old witches, deadly clutching trees, goblin press-gangs, and the scheming sons of the dead Lord of Stormhold. The story is by turns thrillingly scary and very funny. You'll love goofy, earnest Tristran and the talking animals, gnomes, magic trees, and other irresistible denizens of Faerie that he encounters in his travels.Stardustis a perfect read-aloud book, a brand-new fairy tale you'll want to share with a kid, or maybe hoard for yourself.

        "0060731427": "The global power of soccer might be a little hard for Americans, living in a country that views the game with the same skepticism used for the metric system and the threat of killer bees, to grasp fully. But in Europe, South America, and elsewhere, soccer is not merely a pastime but often an expression of the social, economic, political, and racial composition of the communities that host both the teams and their throngs of enthusiastic fans. New Republic editor Franklin Foer, a lifelong devotee of soccer dating from his own inept youth playing days to an adulthood of obsessive fandom, examines soccer's role in various cultures as a means of examining the reach of globalization. Foer's approach is long on soccer reportage, providing extensive history and fascinating interviews on the Rangers-Celtic rivalry and the inner workings of AC Milan, and light on direct discussion of issues like world trade and the exportation of Western culture. But by creating such a compelling narrative of soccer around the planet, Foer draws the reader into these sport-mad societies, and subtly provides the explanations he promises in chapters with titles like \"How Soccer Explains the New Oligarchs\", \"How Soccer Explains Islam's Hope\", and \"How Soccer Explains the Sentimental Hooligan.\" Foer's own passion for the game gives his book an infectious energy but still pales in comparison to the religious fervor of his subjects. His portraits of legendary hooligans in Serbia and Britain, in particular, make the most die-hard roughneck New York Yankees fan look like a choirboy in comparison. Beyond the thugs, Foer also profiles Nigerian players living in the Ukraine, Iranian women struggling against strict edicts to attend matches, and the parallel worlds of Brazilian soccer and politics from which Pele emerged and returned. Foer posits that globalization has eliminated neither local cultural identities nor violent hatred among fans of rival teams, and it has not washed out local businesses in a sea of corporate wealth nor has it quelled rampant local corruption. Readers with an interest in international economics are sure to likeHow Soccer Explains the World, but soccer fans will love it.--John Moe--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

After a slow beginning, this sequel clips along satisfyingly, as shop owner Lydia, a cancer survivor, and her no-nonsense sister, Margaret, meet three new and conveniently quite different friends and bond over the complications of life. Overweight, depressed teenager Courtney Pulanski has found herself plopped into a new town for her senior year, living with her grandma while her dad works in Brazil. Bethanne Hamlin, a recent divorc&eacute;e, and Elise Beaumont, who's been single for years, are both still suffering from their broken marriages.

        "0099472252": "Alice Munro has been accused of telling the same story over and over, and to a certain extent the characterization is true. Her subject matter is inevitably the vagaries of love between middle-aged people in some rural Canadian setting, trapped there by the combination of their desires and weaknesses. Or, if not love, then at least the mysteries of relationships as characters struggle to understand each other and themselves. But this thematic single-mindedness can hardly be considered a criticism considering Munro tells stories better than anybody else and with a level of precision matched by few. It would be like criticizing Shakespeare for writing about politics.Runawayis no exception. The stories take place throughout Canada--northern Ontario, the Prairies, the West Coast, Stratford--and feature women and men drifting in and out of each other's orbits, pulled by forces they don't understand. In \"Runaway,\" a woman considers leaving her husband with the help of a neighbor, but the husband has other plans. In \"Chance,\" a woman leaves her life behind in a quest for a man she met on a train crossing the country. Their intertwined lives play out through two more stories, \"Soon\" and \"Silence,\" but the path they follow is as unpredictable to the reader as it is to them. In \"Trespasses,\" a small town's women dream of escaping their lives only to find themselves in lives they never imagined.What really marks the stories is Munro's sense of mood. There's a sense of hidden menace or even violence everywhere inRunaway. It occasionally erupts, but always in surprising and unexpected ways, and with unintended consequences. Munro may be an old-fashioned storyteller, but she understands chaos theory well enough. The same story? Sure.

As Laskin (Partisans) writes in this gripping chronicle of meteorological chance and human folly and error, the School Children's Blizzard, as it came to be known, was \"a clean, fine blade through the history of the prairie,\" a turning point in the minds of the most steadfast settlers: by the turn of the 20th century, 60% of pioneer families had left the plains. Laskin shows how portions of Minnesota, Nebraska and the Dakotas, heavily promoted by railroads and speculators, represented \"land, freedom, hope\" for thousands of impoverished European immigrants&mdash;particularly Germans and Scandinavians&mdash;who instead found an unpredictable, sometimes brutal environment, a \"land they loved but didn't really understand.\" Their stories of bitter struggle in the blizzard, which Laskin relates via survivors' accounts and a novelistic imagination, are consistently affecting. And Laskin's careful consideration of the inefficiencies of the army's inexpert weather service and his chronicle of the storm's aftermath in the papers (differences in death counts provoked a national \"unseemly brawl\") add to this rewarding read.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Martin (in which he calls the book &#x201C;the original game of thrones&#x201D;), this is the first U.S. publication of the first volume of French novelist Druon&#x2019;s seven-volume historical saga, collectively known as The Accursed Kings. Originally published in 1955, the novel is set in the year 1314. Philip IV, the king of France, has disbanded the Knights Templar, arresting, torturing, and executing most of them. Relations between France and England are as strained as they have ever been. Philip&#x2019;s increasingly desperate search for money to pay his massive debts has virtually bankrupted the country. Against this sprawling backdrop, Druon tells the story of Robert of Artois, a French lord whose lands have been taken from him by his greedy aunt and whose efforts to reclaim his birthright will lead to all-out war between France and England. Unlike Martin&#x2019;s multivolume Song of Fire and Ice, Druon&#x2019;s saga is based on real history and features real people as its central characters. It&#x2019;s historical fiction on a grand scale, full of political intrigue, family drama, and characters who, while drawn from life, are larger than it. Fans of historical epics who have not yet discovered Druon&#x2019;s saga will be thrilled with this one. --David Pitt",

        "B00004XOWT": "If the original PlayStation was the video game console equivalent of the  '60s-era Volkswagen Beetle--economic, reliable, loads of fun--the PS One could  be considered the new Beetle--a hip restyling of those same qualities.Make no mistake: the PS One has all of the same functionality as the original  PlayStation workhorse, will work with all of the same peripherals and  accessories, and will play the existing PlayStation game library, as well as  audio CDs (also note that, like the original PlayStation, it's not compatible  with the more advancedPlayStation  2). The difference here is that this new model is quite a bit smaller than  its older brother, and quite a bit cuter, too.The system is made up of a 32-bit, 34-MHz RISC processor with 16 Mbits of main  memory, 8 Mbits of graphics memory, 24-channel stereo sound, double-speed CD-ROM  drive, and one Dual Shock analog controller. That's not a lot of power, compared  to a next-generation system like theSega  Dreamcast; but, when you factor in its very low price and the enormous  library of games that are available (more than 1,000 that are spread across  every genre imaginable), one can see easily why it's as good a deal as ever. If  rumors of exciting future accessories for the PS One (a four-inch LCD screen  attachment, to name one) are true, this little machine could become a great  option for the on-the-go gamer.--Porter Hall",

If the only way she can get her son Griffin to do his duty and find a wife is by slipping a little something into his fish course, so be it. The funny-tasting fish explains how his mother got him to Spindle Cove (or &#x201C;Spinster Cove,&#x201D; as it is more popularly known), but what to do about the ultimatum his mother delivers once they arrive? Griffin has one day and one day only to select a bride from among the population of eligible ladies, someone whom Judith will then turn into a suitable future Duchess of Halford. Determined to beat his mother at her own game, Griff selects the least likely candidate in the room, overworked and underappreciated serving girl and farmer&#x2019;s daughter Pauline Simms. Dare garnered a well-deserved RITA for last year&#x2019;s installment in her Regency-set Spindle Cove series, and with its fanciful, My Fair Lady-inspired plot, Any Duchess Will Do is an equally beguiling blend of sparkling wit and simmering sensuality that is guaranteed to captivate fans of clever, sexy historical romances. --John Charles",

During a typical day of data gathering, Nate believes his mind is failing: the subject whale has \"Bite Me\" scrawled across its tail. Events become even stranger as the self-proclaimed \"action nerds,\" Nate, photographer Clay, their research assistant Amy, and Kona, a white Rasta (a Jewish kid from New Jersey), encounter sabotage to their data and equipment. They also observe increasingly bizarre whale behavior, including a phone call from the whale to their wealthy sponsor to ask that Nate bring it a hot pastrami and Swiss on rye, and discover both a thriving underwater city and the secret to what happened to Amelia Earhart.Thoughtful, irreverent, and often hilarious, Moore has crafted a tale that contains a bit of the saga of declining whale populations due to hunting and habitat destruction, as well as his over-the-top, decadent wit as applied to scientific methodology and professional jealousies. Moore notes a pasty, rival scientist \"looked like Death out for his after-dinner stroll before a busy night of e-mailing heart attacks and tumors to a few million lucky winners,\" and that killer whales (which are all named Kevin), are \"just four tons of doofus dressed up like a police car.\" Smart, sincere, and a whale of a story,Flukeis terrific.--Michael Ferch--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

As Thomas and his band of not-so-merry mercenaries roam the ravaged French countryside in search of pillage and plunder, they are bidden by the Earl of Northhampton to unearth the lost sword of Saint Peter, a mythic weapon purported to bestow on its owner tremendous powers for either good or evil. Naturally, the French are also seeking this holy relic, and all roads lead to Poitiers, where the badly outnumbered English forces wage a fierce battle against their enemies, resulting in one of the most improbably astounding victories of the protracted conflict. In addition to carving out another action-packed martial adventure, Cornwell spotlights one of the most significant but often overlooked battles of the era.

But looks aren't everything; his quality, an admirer once wrote,  \"was mostly in his heart.\" Laura Hillenbrand tells the story of the horse who  became a cultural icon inSeabiscuit: An American Legend.Seabiscuit rose to prominence with the help of an unlikely triumvirate: owner  Charles Howard, an automobile baron who once declared that \"the day of the horse  is past\"; trainer Tom Smith, a man who \"had cultivated an almost mystical  communication with horses\"; and jockey Red Pollard, who was down on his luck  when he charmed a then-surly horse with his calm demeanor and a sugar cube.  Hillenbrand details the ups and downs of \"team Seabiscuit,\" from early training  sessions to record-breaking victories, and from serious injury to \"Horse of the  Year\"--as well as the Biscuit's fabled rivalry with War Admiral. She also  describes the world of horseracing in the 1930s, from the snobbery of Eastern  journalists regarding Western horses and public fascination with the great  thoroughbreds to the jockeys' torturous weight-loss regimens, including saunas  in rubber suits, strong purgatives, even tapeworms.Along the way, Hillenbrand paints wonderful images: tears in Tom Smith's eyes as  his hero, legendary trainer James Fitzsimmons, asked to hold Seabiscuit's bridle  while the horse was saddled; critically injured Red Pollard, whose  chest was crushed in a racing accident a few weeks before, listening to the San  Antonio Handicap from his hospital bed, cheering \"Get going, Biscuit! Get 'em,  you old devil!\"; Seabiscuit happily posing for photographers for several minutes  on end; other horses refusing to work out with Seabiscuit because he teased and  taunted them with his blistering speed.Though sometimes her prose takes on a distinctly purple hue (\"His history had  the ethereal quality of hoofprints in windblown snow\"; \"The California sunlight  had the pewter cast of a declining season\"), Hillenbrand has crafted a  delightful book.

Jacinda's determination to do things her own way finds her nearly captured by dragon hunters, but a surprisingly kind young hunter named Will allows her to escape. Rather than suffer the pride's punishment for her daughter's risky behavior, Jacinda's mother decides the family should flee to live among regular humans.

Pepperberg, who teaches animal cognition, has previously documented the results of her 30-year relationship with Alex inThe Alex Studies.

Pepperberg deftly interweaves her own personal narrative&mdash;including her struggles to gain recognition for her research&mdash;with more intimate scenes of life with Alex than she was able to present in her earlier work, creating a story that scientists and laypeople can equally enjoy, if they can all keep from crying over Alex's untimely death.(Nov.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The setup is familiar: strong-willed American heiress Lillian Bowman gets under the skin of straitlaced earl Marcus Westcliff, and soon finds herself sharing the sheets with him. But what distinguishes this book from a multitude of similar stories are Kleypas's characters. One can imagine the mouthy Lillian as a regular onSex and the Cityand, with his contemporary sensibilities and hunky good looks, Marcus could easily win the heart of a modern woman. Indeed, while the protagonists are both hardheaded in a typical way and their path toward love is peppered with few surprises, it's no chore to sit back and be amused by their antics and engrossed in their struggles.

        "B00002STEZ": "If Mario is Nintendo's Luke Skywalker, then it's safe to say that Donkey Kong is Nintendo's Darth Vader. Originally cast as the primate villain in the Donkey Kong arcade game back in the early '80s, Kong and his many descendants have stepped away from the \"dark side\" and become forces for good. While it's genetically unlikely that Kong is Mario's father, it's been well documented that Kong and company have been enlisted to rescue Nintendo in times of trouble. Remember when the Super NES was \"threatened\" by Sega's 32-bit/CD add-on hype? A game called Donkey Kong Country came out, featuring prerendered graphics never before seen on a home console. Not only did it breathe new life into the Super NES' sales, it spawned a profitable series that kept Nintendo's 16-bit scene alive for years to come. Fast forward to 1999. Sega and Sony again threaten the Nintendo 64 with superior game consoles, and once again Nintendo calls on Kong's descendants to breathe new life into its 64-bit system with Donkey Kong 64. While this much-anticipated 3D adventure game has high-quality gameplay and plenty of variety to fuel Nintendo's sales this holiday season, it lacks enough \"wow factor\" to exert the revolutionary influence that Donkey Kong Country had. Donkey Kong 64 starts with a well-worn storyline: Donkey Kong's isle of paradise faces destruction by an invading K.Rool and his crocodile Kremlings. Donkey now has four friends to help him defeat K.Rool: Diddy Kong, his perennial sidekick; Lanky Kong, an ape with super-stretchy limbs; Tiny Kong, a teenybopper who can shrink to fit into small holes; and Chunky Kong, a muscle-bound lunkhead who can lift boulders and smash down doors. Veterans of the Donkey Kong series will also note the return of old-timers like Cranky, Funky, and Candy, all of whom upgrade the Kongs with new abilities, hints, shooting weapons, and musical instruments that help unlock hidden areas. For the most part, Donkey Kong 64 is an explore-and-collect adventure. Those who obtain perverse pleasure from collecting every last coin and item in this type of game will be titillated - and those who don't will be frustrated. The main thrust is to find 200 golden bananas in the main world and in the seemingly standard individual stages: an underwater level, a forest level, a jungle level, an industrial level, etc. As expected, almost none of these bananas are in plain view - multipart puzzles and obstacles impede the way to these treasures. However, there's plenty more to collect: regular bananas, fairies (which you must take pictures of with a camera), banana medals, super-secret Rareware coins, blueprint pieces (found by defeating certain enemies), crowns (to unlock multiplayer games) and boss keys (to unlock new areas on the island). Now, factor in that each of the five characters must find some of these items individually: Devoted gamers will see this as added replay value, while others will see it as a royal pain in the Donkey derriere. If that weren't enough, it seems the developers threw every gameplay style they could think of into the mix. This gameplay variety is perhaps this title's main strength, although the quality of the games varies. For starters, the game has a separate two-to four-player mode, with games such as a battle arena, where Kongs can beat up each other in a circular ring, or a GoldenEye-type shooting game. In the adventure mode, you earn golden bananas by completing mini-bonus games. Some are true games in their own right, such as a racing track, race-boat water course, or mine-cart roller coaster - all of which look impressive in 3D. Some of these games are less visually impressive but are entertaining nevertheless, such as a maze where the Kong must avoid enemy detection, or a bug splattering stage. The remaining games - such as a simple target-shooting session or a slot machine - are either run-of-the-mill or too easy to sustain long-term interest. Finally, a couple of bonus games are direct translations of old-school titles, including a partial version of the original Donkey Kong arcade game that'll bring back memories for some. Since the Kongs learn unique abilities as the game progresses, some Kongs have special stages, as well. Remember the barrel-blast levels in the 16-bit games? Donkey now plays them in 3D with a target sight. As the barrel moves, you can shoot Donkey out to other barrels. Diddy gets a jet pack that lets him complete some flying stages, while the other three characters learn other impressive skills, such as shrinking (Tiny), climbing up steep slopes (Lanky), and lifting or breaking heavy objects (Chunky). If that weren't enough, some characters can transform into animals, such as a rhino or a swordfish, to break into boxes or secret areas and kill bothersome enemies.--Nelson Taruc--Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

The rivers and lakes ice over, the ground turns rock hard, and snow buries everything. Bugs disappear, and many scavengers go underground. The result: Corpses do not putrefy in the great outdoors. Floaters are not pulled from the St. Lawrence... and some of last season's dead are not found until the spring melt.\"Readers of Kathy Reichs's cool and clever first forensic thrillerD&eacute;j&agrave; Deadwill  recognize the ironic voice of Tempe (short for Temperance) Brennan, the North Carolina-born scientist who winds up working at the Laboratoire de M&eacute;dicine L&eacute;gale in Montreal. Here she bristles at the  conservative attitudes of some of her Canadian colleagues.Despite the cold weather, Tempe's workload quickly becomes heavy: the bones of a long-dead nun now up for sainthood have been moved and tampered with; a deadly house fire turns out to be arson; and a university teaching assistant disappears after joining a cult. Tempe must figure out where (and why) all the bodies are buried in the hard Canadian ground. Her investigations take her home to North Carolina, and to a strange colony living on an offshore island.Unlike certain other writers who specialize in forensic pathology,  Reichs doesn't revel in the horror of death or rub our noses in gore: she uses the science of death to reveal rather than to shock or startle. It definitely makes for easier reading--especially at mealtimes.--Dick Adler--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

Solid Snake, everyone's favorite mullet-sporting supersoldier, is  back, along with many other familiar faces and voices. While its predecessor was  lauded for telling a complex story, this sequel has even more fascinating twists  and turns. Also, likeMetal Gear Solid,MGS2takes console-game storytelling to an entirely new level with  stunning in-game movies, great graphics, and game mechanics that let you find  your own solutions to challenges. The game's twisting and at times bizarre plot  will undoubtedly keep some gamers perplexed.Konami has replaced the moronic enemies from the firstMGSwith more  cerebral and capable foes; this causes an even greater emphasis on stealth than  the original. The controls have been refined and Snake's repertoire of moves has  grown, significantly deepening the gameplay. This is, technically and  stylistically, one of the best-looking PS2 games on the market. The sound is  also topnotch, with a fabulous score and outstanding voice acting. What makes  this game such a standout, however, is how all of these sight, sound, and story  elements combine to immerse the player into an entertainment form somewhere  between movie and game. It will be years beforeMetal Gear Solid 2: Sons of  Libertyis surpassed. This is interactive entertainment at its finest.--Raymond M.

        "0060580674": "If he weren't such a good action writer, Rollins might make a dynamite climatologist. Each of his thrillers has featured as a central character an extreme environment, most recently the Arctic ice (Ice Hunt, 2003) and now the hot sands of Saudi Arabia. But while Rollins writes settings and scenes that sizzle, what's caught in the heat are usually familiar characters grappling with far-fetched threats, and so it is here. That one male lead is a danger-courting archeologist named Omaha Dunn seems less parodic than tired, and the novel's premise of a hoard of antimatter hidden in the legendary city of Ubar is almost as ridiculous as the idea that this cache has been guarded for millennia by an order of women who propagate without men, via parthenogenesis. Rollins writes less like Michael Crichton than Stan Lee. Most of his readers won't care, though, because there's just enough scientific gloss on the nonsense to make it palatable, and anyway, what they want, and what he delivers, is action, as Omaha and an American military agent, Painter, join forces with two Mideastern women, one a scientist, the other a billionaire, to locate the steadily destabilizing antimatter before it's snatched by a villainous cabal, or worse, blows up the planet.

        "0061243582": "Equal parts droll and gorgeous nostalgia book and heartfelt plea for a renewed sense of adventure in the lives of boys and men, Conn and Hal Iggulden'sThe Dangerous Book for Boysbecame a mammoth bestseller in the United Kingdom in 2006. Adapted, in moderation, for American customs in this edition (cricket is gone, rugby remains; conkers are out, Navajo Code Talkers in),The Dangerous Bookis a guide book for dads as well as their sons, as a reminder of lore and technique that have not yet been completely lost to the digital age. Recall the adventures of Scott of the Antarctic and the Battle of the Somme, relearn how to palm a coin, tan a skin, and, most charmingly, wrap a package in brown paper and string. The book's ambitions are both modest and winningly optimistic: you get the sense that by learning how to place a splint or write in invisible ink, a boy might be prepared for anything, even girls (which warrant a small but wise chapter of their own).InsideThe Dangerous Book for BoysFigure 8 KnotSheet Bend KnotThe Battle of WaterlooQuestions for Conn IgguldenConn and Hal Iggulden are two brothers who have not forgotten what it was like to be boys. Conn taught for many years before becoming one of the most admired and popular young historical novelists with his Emperor series, based on the life of Julius Caesar, and his newly embarked series on Genghis Khan, while Hal is a theater director. We asked Conn about their collaboration.Amazon.com:It's difficult to describe what a phenomenonThe Dangerous Book for Boyswas in the UK last year. When I would check the bestseller list on our sister site, Amazon.co.uk, there would be, along with your book, which spent much of the year at the top of the list, a half-dozen apparent knockoff books of similar boy knowledge. Clearly, you tapped into something big. What do you think it was?Iggulden:In a word, fathers. I am one myself and I think we've become aware that the whole \"health and safety\" overprotective culture isn't doing our sons any favors. Boys need to learn about risk. They need to fall off things occasionally, or--and this is the important bit--they'll take worse risks on their own. If we do away with challenging playgrounds and cancel school trips for fear of being sued, we don't end up with safer boys--we end up with them walking on train tracks. In the long run, it's not safe at all to keep our boys in the house with a Playstation. It's not good for their health or their safety.You only have to push a boy on a swing to see how much enjoys the thrill of danger. It's hard-wired. Remove any opportunity to test his courage and they'll find ways to test themselves that will be seriously dangerous for everyone around them. I think of it like playing the lottery--someone has to say \"Look, youwon'twin--and your childrenwon'tbe hurt. Relax. Itwon'tbe you.\"I think that's the core of the book's success. It isn't just a collection of things to do. The heroic stories alone are something we haven't had for too long. It isn't about climbing Everest, but it is an attitude, a philosophy for fathers and sons. Our institutions are too wrapped up in terror over being sued--so we have to do things with them ourselves. This book isn't a bad place to start.As for knockoff books--great. They'll give my son something to read that doesn't involve him learning a dull moral lesson of some kind--just enjoying an adventure or learning skills and crafts so that he has a feeling of competence and confidence--just as we have.Amazon.com:You made some changes for the U.S. edition, and I for one am sorry that you have removed the section on conkers, if only because it's such a lovely and mysterious word. What are (or what is) conkers?Iggulden:Horse chestnuts strung on a shoelace and knocked against one another until they shatter. In the entire history of the world, no one has ever been hurt by a conker, but it's still been banned by some British schools,just in case. Another school banned paper airplanes. Honestly, it's enough to make you weep, if I did that sort of thing, which I try not to. Reading Jane Austen is still allowed, however.Amazon.com:What knowledge did you decide was important to add for American boys? I notice in both editions you have an excellent and useful section on table football, as played with coins. Is paper football strictly an American pastime? I'm not sure I could have gotten through the fourth grade without it.Iggulden:I like knowing the details of battles, so Gettysburg and the Alamo had to go in, along with the Gettysburg address, stickball, state capitals, U.S. mountains, American trees, insects, U.S. historical timelines, and a lot of others. Navajo code talkers of WWII is a great chapter. It probably helps that I am a huge fan of America. It was only while rewriting for the U.S. that I realized how many positive references there already are. You have NASA and NASA trumps almost anything.As for paper football, ever since I thought of putting the book together, people keep saying things like \"You have rockets in there, yes? Everyone loves rockets!\" Paper football is the first American one, but there will be many others. No book in the world is long enough to put them all in--unless we do a sequel, of course.Amazon.com:Do you thinkThe Dangerous Book for Boysis being read by actual boys, or only by nostalgic adults? Have you seen boys getting up from their Xboxes to go outside and perform first aid or tan animal skins or build go-carts?Iggulden:I've had a lot of emails and letters from boys who loved the book--as well as fathers. I've had responses from kids as young as ten and an old man of 87, who pointed out a problem with the shadow stick that we've since changed. The thing to remember is that we may be older and more cynical every year, but boys simply aren't. If they are given the chance to make a go-cart with their dad, they jump at it. Mine did. Nothing gives me more pleasure than to know the book is being used with fathers and sons together, trying things out. Nothing is more valuable to a boy than time with his dad, learning something fun--or something difficult. That's part of the attitude too. If it's hard, you don't make it easy, you grab it by the throat and hang on for as long as it takes.The book is often bought by fathers, of course. Their sons don't know Scott of the Antarctic is a great adventure story. How could they if it isn't taught any more? Good, heroic stories don't appear much in modern school curriculums--and then we wonder why boys don't seem interested.Amazon.com:And finally, on to the important questions: Should Pluto still be a planet? And what was the best dinosaur?Iggulden:Pluto is a planet. I know there are scientists who say it isn't, but it's big enough to be round and it has a moon, for crying out loud. Of course it's a planet. Give it ten years and they'll be agreeing with me again.As for the best dinosaur, it depends what you mean by best. For sheer perfection, it probably has to be the shark and the crocodile. Modern ones are smaller but their record for sheer survival is pretty impressive. I only hope humanity can do as well.

As the wizards struggle to learn the game, aided by the university's hired help, Ankh-Morpork's ruler schemes to use the competition for his own purposes.

Simpson dedicates the book to his climbing partner, Simon Yates, and to &quot;those friends who have gone to the mountains and have not returned.&quot; What is it that compels certain individuals to willingly seek out the most inhospitable climate on earth? To risk their lives in an attempt to leave footprints where few or none have gone before? Simpson's vivid narrative of a dangerous climbing expedition will convince even the most die-hard couch potato that such pursuits fall within the realm of the sane.

The air was filled with the sounds the  crows made as they moved around.\" Another disturbing element of the town is that the Council of Elders  (who wear creepy crow hats) has thousands of rules, such as \"don't hurt crows\" and \"don't build mechanical  devices.\" Fortunately, the Baudelaires are taken in by a kindly handyman named Hector who cooks them  delicious Mexican food and secretly breaks rules. Still, neither Hector nor an entire village can protect the  orphans from the clutches of the money-grubbing Count Olaf, who has relentlessly pursued them (actually,  just their fortune) sinceThe Bad Beginning.

        "0060545763": "*Starred Review* It is probably the most iconic photograph of the 1967 Six-Day War&#x2014;a group of Israeli paratroopers gazing upward with a look of wonder at the sacred Western Wall, the surviving remnant of the temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE. These were men of Brigade 55, a reserve unit primarily responsible for liberating the wall and seizing East Jerusalem from Jordanian control. The photo and the Israeli victory engendered an immediate sense of pride, joy, and euphoria that enveloped Israeli and Diaspora Jews, left and right, secular and religious. Since then, of course, the conquest of Jerusalem and the West Bank (Judea and Samaria) has been rather a poisoned pill, dividing Israel politically as it rules over a huge Arab population. Halevi is an American-born Israeli journalist and a promoter of Jewish-Arab reconciliation. Here he tracks the subsequent lives of seven of the Brigade 55 members. Some became staunch proponents of settlement activity on Palestinian land and some became members of the left-wing Peace Now movement. One even helped create an anti-Zionist underground movement. Halevi succeeds in his broader goal of linking these men and their families to Israel&#x2019;s history during the past five decades. This is a beautifully written and sometimes heartbreaking account of these men, their families, and their nation. --Jay Freeman",

But John Kelly'sThe Great Mortalityis a page-turner despite its grim subject matter and graphic detail. Credit Kelly's animated prose and uncanny ability to drop his reader smack in the middle of the 14th century, as a heretofore unknown menace stalks Eurasia from \"from the China Sea to the sleepy fishing villages of coastal Portugal [producing] suffering and death on a scale that, even after two world wars and twenty-seven million AIDS deaths worldwide, remains astonishing.\" Take Kelly's vivid description of London in the fall of 1348: \"A nighttime walk across Medieval London would probably take only twenty minutes or so, but traversing the daytime city was a different matter.... Imagine a shopping mall where everyone shouts, no one washes, front teeth are uncommon and the shopping music is provided by the slaughterhouse up the road.\" Yikes, and that's before just about everything with a pulse starts dying and piling up in the streets, reducing the population of Europe by anywhere from a third to 60 percent in a few short years. In addition to taking readers on a walking tour through plague-ravaged Europe, Kelly heaps on the ancillary information and every last bit of it is captivating. We get a thorough breakdown of the three types of plagues that prey on humans; a detailed account of how the plague traveled from nation to nation (initially by boat via flea-infested rats); how floods (and the appalling hygiene of medieval people) made Europe so susceptible to the disease; how the plague triggered a new social hierarchy favoring women and the proletariat but also sparked vicious anti-Semitism; and especially, how the plague forever changed the way people viewed the church.

        "0060887443": "In this solid debut thriller, a troubled doctor gets caught up in a global conspiracy after a mysteriously afflicted four-year-old Guatemalan boy dies on his watch. Pediatric ER physician Luke McKenna's curiosity is piqued when it seems the child's symptoms don't match any known disease; he's more intrigued, however, when hospital administrators and Guatemalan officials whisk away the child's body before McKenna can perform a postmortem investigation. While trying to beat back haunting, at times debilitating memories of his time in a shadowy military organization, McKenna continues to pursue the child's case, attracting the attention of a professional killer and the men behind him. It isn't until McKenna's framed for the murders of a former girlfriend and a football player that the good doctor becomes certain a conspiracy's afoot. From there, McKenna's on the run, using his old military training and contacts, as well as his medical expertise, to evade the cops and killers, get to Guatemala, try to uncover the forces he's up against and face his personal demons. Despite some clunky expository dialogue (practically a genre requisite) and a disappointing ending, Hawley delivers intense action, tricky plotting and an unpredictable hero sure to satisfy anyone with an appetite for a good page-turner.(Mar.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She'd had a massive brain hemorrhage and had only survived thanks to some very risky surgery. Doctors were divided about why she'd had this stroke; indeed, Garrison spent the next weeks and months fending off a dire diagnosis, vasculitis, from the pseudonymous \"Dr. Jerk.\" Most of the professionals she dealt with were negative, wanting her to accept that she'd never walk again or have a full, satisfying life. But Garrison, with the help of her supportive husband, brothers, parents, friends and a few gifted therapists and doctors, managed an extraordinary recovery.

        "0060537639": "A former submarine commander in Britain's Royal Navy, Menzies must enjoy doing battle. The amateur historian's lightly footnoted, heavily speculative re-creation of little-known voyages made by Chinese ships in the early 1400s goes far beyond what most experts in and outside of China are willing to assert and will surely set tongues wagging. According to Menzies's brazen but dull account of the Middle Kingdom's exploits at sea, Magellan, Dias, da Gama, Cabral and Cook only \"discovered\" lands the Chinese had already visited, and they sailed with maps drawn from Chinese charts. Menzies alleges that the Chinese not only discovered America, but also established colonies here long before Columbus set out to sea. Because China burned the records of its historic expeditions led by Zheng He, the famed eunuch admiral and the focus of this account, Menzies is forced to defend his argument by compiling a tedious package of circumstantial evidence that ranges from reasonable to ridiculous. While the book does contain some compelling claims-for example, that the Chinese were able to calculate longitude long before Western explorers-drawn from Menzies's experiences at sea, his overall credibility is undermined by dubious research methods. In just one instance, when confounded by the derivation of cryptic words on a Venetian map, Menzies first consults an expert at crossword puzzles rather than an etymologist. Such an approach to scholarship, along with a promise of more proof to come in the paperback edition, casts a shadow of doubt over Menzies's discoveries. 32 pages of color illus., 27 maps and diagrams.

Instead, the former ballerina finds herself overwhelmed by memories of her homeland and of the events, both glorious and heartbreaking, that changed the course of her life half a century ago.It was in Russia that she discovered the magic of the theater; that she fell in love with the poet Viktor Elsin; that she and her dearest companions&mdash;Gersh, a brilliant composer, and the exquisite Vera, Nina&rsquo;s closest friend&mdash;became victims of Stalinist aggression. And it was in Russia that a terrible discovery incited a deadly act of betrayal&mdash;and an ingenious escape that led Nina to the West and eventually to Boston.Nina has kept her secrets for half a lifetime. But two people will not let the past rest: Drew Brooks, an inquisitive young associate at a Boston auction house, and Grigori Solodin, a professor of Russian who believes that a unique set of jewels may hold the key to his own ambiguous past. Together these unlikely partners begin to unravel a mystery surrounding a love letter, a poem, and a necklace of unknown provenance, setting in motion a series of revelations that will have life-altering consequences for them all.A Q&amp;A with Author Daphne KalotayQ:Russian Winterincludes a cast of fascinating characters. Were any of these diverse characters modeled after anyone specific?Kalotay:The central protagonist, Nina Revskaya (a ballerina) and her mother-in-law (the former aristocrat) are both modeled on relatives of mine.Nina is in some ways based on my Hungarian grandmother.  Now 93 years old, she too has a very strong personality, and I see in her the same fiery strength Nina exhibits.  My grandmother is a more joyous and loving person than Nina, but once she decides she doesn&rsquo;t like someone, that&rsquo;s it; she is very headstrong, and I&rsquo;ve glimpsed the way that she decides that certain people are her enemies.  It&rsquo;s a quality that has long intrigued me.Q:Your family were Holocaust survivors and escaped from behind the Iron Curtain&mdash;Hungary&mdash;in 1956. How did that background influence the story?Kalotay:I suppose the most profound way my family&rsquo;s history influenced my novel is&mdash;ironically&mdash;that I tried to avoid that history and transfer it to another place and time, rather than address it directly.  Just as my father never speaks of his experience of the Holocaust, I&rsquo;ve chosen not to write in a direct way about that topic or about my father&rsquo;s childhood in post-war Hungary, though that experience has of course informed so much of my family&rsquo;s trajectory and personality.  I&rsquo;ve long heard recollections of my grandmother, aunt, and father&rsquo;s life in Soviet-occupied Hungary, and in the 1980&rsquo;s I saw for myself what life under communism was like there.  But, perhaps because that experience still isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;mine,&rdquo; I felt more comfortable transporting those realities to the harsher world of Soviet Russia.Q:You worked onRussian Winterfor six years.  What was the most difficult aspect of writing the novel?  What kind of research did you do?Kalotay:The most difficult part of writing this book was figuring out how to allow my imagination to run free when in fact the constraints of Stalinist society meant fewer possibilities for what characters might say or do, or where they might go, than in an open society.  I felt very restrained by the basic logistics of a world where everyone is fearful and being reported on and can&rsquo;t just go off and do whatever they like.In order to get a better sense of this, I did a lot of reading, mostly memoirs and biographies by artists and intellectuals who had experienced that era, or by Westerners who had travelled behind the Iron Curtain during that time (though of course their experience was quite different.) I also made a visit to Russia, but that was after I&rsquo;d finished writing.Q:Russian Winteris an evocative portrait of life in the Soviet Union under Stalin, a time and place where politics and art were inextricably intertwined.  How did Stalin use art to further his goals, and do you see any similarities here in the West of today?Kalotay:Stalin understood, on the most basic level, that a beautiful ballet can be uplifting even when the realities of life are very harsh, and that a well-choreographed parade with dance and acrobatics really can instill national pride and dispel doubts.In a way it&rsquo;s amazing to think that in America most artists and writers like myself never have to give a thought to whether or not their work is going get them in trouble.  Our censors are the hoops we have to jump through to get published or have a show produced or a painting shown.  Our gatekeepers aren&rsquo;t politicians; they&rsquo;re editors or producers, and the tyranny isn&rsquo;t politics but what&rsquo;s in vogue, or what&rsquo;s cheapest to produce, or what the marketing folks think will make money.  And yet it&rsquo;s a capitalist society that allows us the privilege to make any sort of art we want, whether or not anyone notices it or pays attention.Q:When you began the novel did you have the ending in mind, or did the story lead you?Kalotay:I knew what Nina&rsquo;s general trajectory would be, and that the professor&rsquo;s original assumptions would turn out to be somehow incorrect, because I&rsquo;d already written a short story that ended that way.  But I didn&rsquo;t know exactly how it would all come together, plot-wise, or what kind of rapprochement would be possible for my characters.  There were also a lot of logistics I had to figure out&mdash;such as how, specifically, my dancer would manage to get out of the Soviet Union.Q:What does artistic freedom mean to you?Kalotay:For me it means being able to write what I want.  Here our freedom is tied not so much to political realities as financial ones, and I think people like myself worry more that we won&rsquo;t necessarily be &ldquo;allowed&rdquo; to write what we want (in my case smaller, understated novels rather than flashy, sensational or trendy ones) without losing the support of the publishing world.(Photo by Jeremy Saladyga)",
        "B00009YEK0": "Video game makers have been experimenting with live-action video in games since the early 1980s but EyeToy (a digital camera for PlayStation2) marks the first time it's been done right. The device magically superimposes video-game graphics onto a player's image and translates his or her movements into controlling elements of the game. It is the best improvement of video game controls since the joystick.The EyeToy camera plugs into your PS2EyeToy has two components: a digital camera that plugs into one of the USB ports in the front of the PS2 and a disc of party games. In the EyeToy games--there are 12 on the disc, but some of them are little more than variations on the same theme--your image is at the center of the action. The game is totally controlled by moving your body in front of the camera. For example, in one game where the object is to beat back invading hordes of kung-fu fighters who come at you from the four corners of the screen, you must move your hands (or elbows, head, hips, whatever) to connect with the fighters onscreen and slap them away. Unlike most contemporary video games, EyeToy is so intuitive that most users will be able to play in a matter of seconds--even toddlers and senior citizens. Watching someone play EyeToy is fun: onscreen, the games are like the fanciful mix of live action and animation &#225; laWho Framed Roger Rabbit, and off-screen, the player's movements are almost as goofy as those playingDance Dance Revolution.EyeToy is best enjoyed by groupsSetting up EyeToy is simple--just plug in the camera and drop in the disc--but fine-tuning it for your game environment takes a little effort. First, you'll need to have adequate, well-balanced lighting. We found that a bare 60-watt light bulb positioned behind the EyeToy camera worked pretty well. Next, you should clear away as many objects as possible between you and the EyeToy camera. Not only can extra objects impede the camera's function, they can present hazard when playing the game. A uniform background helps, too; we found that a light-colored wall worked better than a dark background. Before you drag the couch out on the lawn and pull pictures off the wall, try out the camera in different positions to see if you can find something that works without redecorating. The recommended placement of your EyeToy camera is right on top of your TV, but if your PS2 is situated farther than the 72-inch attached camera cord, you will have to get creative. We tried pointing the camera up at us from a coffee table and it worked fine.The EyeToy games, while fun, are too simple to keep solo gamers interested for long periods of time. EyeToy is best as a party game played with groups of friends, or as a way to show off your PS2. And as a peripheral for future games EyeToy holds a lot of promise. Let's hope that Tony Hawk and John Madden find a use for this little camera.--Porter B.

        "0061231428": "Guest Review: Steve Berry onAltar of Edenby James RollinsI first started to hate James Rollins in 1999.  That was when I picked up a paperback original calledSubterranean, Rollins' first book.   While I was struggling even to write a manuscript, this veterinarian out in California had actually done it and sold the thing.  I hated him.  Over the next few years, I would wander into a bookstore and discover that the 'vet from Sacramento' had written more stories.  I read them all, titles likeIce Hunt,Amazonia, andExcavationand hated him even more.  There I was, struggling to get published, and this guy had found the big time.I finally made it to print in 2003 and, sure enough, who's my chief competition?  You got it.  James Rollins.  The guy creates Sigma Force and writes  oneNew York Timesbestseller after another.  Titles likeMap of Bones,Black Order,The Last Oracle, andThe Judas Strain.   Amazingly, while this string of Rollins' books flooded bookstores, I managed to eke out some modest success.  But every time things started going right, here came that 'vet from California' again with another book.Occasionally, I'm asked to provide a quote or two for someone else's book.  I can't tell you how many times my words of praise languish on the back cover while Rollins' is front and center.  Rollins.  Rollins.  Rollins.  That's all I hear.  Even on Amazon, in the section titled \"Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought,\" ON MY BOOK PAGES, there's always a Rollins cover or two staring back at me from the screen.And, if things weren't bad enough, the 'vet from California' wrote another series.  Some character calledJake Ransom and The Skull King's Shadow.   It's not enough Rollins is everywhere in adult fiction (taking up valuable spots on the bestseller lists), now he has to claim a piece of the young adult pie, too.  I read that he's going to write more of those things.  Apparently, the first one did okay.  Like that was a big surprise.Which brings us toAltar of Eden, Rollins' latest concoction. Here he goes again, not satisfied with a thriller out in the summer, he has to publish another in the winter.  Which, by the way, directly competes with me (of course, Rollins doesn't care).  This new book has it all.   A savvy veterinarian (like that was a stretch), genetic engineering on long extinct animals (which was fascinating, I have to admit), fractal science (whatever that is), biological warfare (in ways you've never seen before), and mach-speed mayhem.   The thing is drum-tight in its execution.  Does this guy have herbs that stimulate his imagination in some amazing way?  I readAltar of Edenin two sittings (yeah, it's that good) and, when finished, I promptly hurled the book across the room.  It landed on the shelf where all of Rollins' other tomes stand, each sheathed in plastic, first editions, and, of course, signed (for which he charged me $5.00 a piece, cash.  He wouldn't take my check).'Oh, the humanity.'I barely bang out a-book-a-year and Rollins writes three.All of them great.Like I said, I hate this guy.Which is too bad, because he's not only a terrific writer but also a close friend.",

After graduating from the University of Alabama with a degree in English and Creative Writing, she moved to New York City, where she worked in magazine publishing and marketing for nine years.The Helpis her first novel.Kathryn Stockett:This is by far your most epic novel to date.  How long did it take you to writeThe Shoemaker&rsquo;s Wife?Adriana Trigiani:I worked on this story for over 20 years as I wrote scripts and novels and had my own family. There are scraps of paper, dinner napkins, and bills with timelines and notes scrawled across them. There are old notebooks filled with my grandmother&rsquo;s musings from 1985. I collected train tickets, copies of ships&rsquo; manifests, and a silk tag with my grandmother&rsquo;s name from garments she had created. I traveled as far as the Italian Alps and as close as the few blocks it takes me to walk to Little Italy in New York City to capture the historical aspects of the story. All of this went into the novel. It was a delicious gestation period.Stockett:This is a novel, but it is inspired by a true story&mdash;a family story, right?Trigiani:Yes&mdash;my grandparents, Lucia and Carlo. Their love was a dance with fate. It is riddled with near misses against a landscape of such massive world events that it&rsquo;s a wonder they got together atall. My challenge was to present their world to the reader so it might feel it was happening in the moment. I wanted the reader to have the experience I had when stories were told to me by the woman who lived them.Stockett:The novel takes place during the first half of the twentieth century--what is so compelling about this period of time to you?Trigiani:The cusp of the twentieth century was a time everything was new&mdash;cars, phones, planes, electricity, even sportswear, and in each innovation was a kind of explosive potential. No one could predict where all the inventions would lead, people only knew that change was unavoidable.My grandparents were delighted every time America presented them with something they had never seen before. And my grandparents&rsquo; sense of wonder never left them, so I tried not to let it leave the page, be it a cross-country train ride or the first snap of the bobbin on an electric Singer sewing machine.Stockett:Through the remarkable story of Enza and Ciro, your novel tells the larger story of the immigrant experience in America.Trigiani:What a gift immigrants were and are to this country! They bring their talents and loyalty and make our country even greater. My grandparents were proud to be new Americans. Assimilation was not about copying an American ideal, but aspiring to their own version of it. The highest compliment you could pay a fellow immigrant was: he (or she) was ahard worker. I hear the phrasework like an immigrantsaid, but really, it&rsquo;s bigger than that&mdash;we must alsodream like immigrants.Stockett:The Shoemaker&rsquo;s Wifeseamlessly brings together fictional characters and historical figures&mdash;how did the wonderful Caruso enter the novel?Trigiani:It started with a three-foot stack of vinyl records&mdash;my grandmother Lucia&rsquo;s collection of Caruso. Her absolute devotion to The Great Voice lasted her whole life long. I knew, in order to write this novel, I had to fall in love with Caruso too, because he sang the score of my grandparents&rsquo; love affair.When Lucia passed, I went to my first opera, seeking understanding and comfort.

        "B000JLIXIG": "In Resistance: Fall of Man, US and British forces band together in a last-ditch effort to save England from a horric scourge -- the Chimera. This parasitic species infects other life forms with a virus that rapidly mutates victims into new Chimera. In mere decades this race has ripped apart populations across Asia and Europe and by 1951 has landed on the shores of England. You play the part of US a Army Ranger, fighting alongside a group of British resistance soldiers to free the country from the Chimera and to halt their spread across the globe.PLAYSTATION 3's killer app has arrived.Wield human or Chimeran weapons.View larger.Chimera come in a variety of terrifying shapes and sizes.View larger.The environments are incredibly detailed and lifelike.View larger.Enemies will flank you if you're careless about picking them off.View larger.The Chimera warsWar is everywhere and everything in Resistance. An alien race began toying with the planet just after Word War I and in mere decades, the Chimera &#x2568; a species of unknown origin propagating a virus that converts other life forms into more Chimera &#x2568; has overrun Russia and all of Europe. Humanity&#x2552;s hope for survival is slim, and the tide of the battle rests on the shoulders of U.S. Army Ranger, Sgt. Nathan Hale.The Chimera didn't plan to take this protracted war lying down, however, and amassed their forces in Russia. Once Russia was captured, they quickly erected a wall around the former country, rebuking all efforts at communication or contact. While the world waited and wondered what other terrors might spill from the wall, England prepares for and falls to a major Chimera invasion in 1951.The United States comes to aid their English allies, but all does not go as planned. The next three days will see some of the most intense fighting the war has known thus far, and it's up to you to end the Chimera threat before the plague of defeat can encircle the globe.Next-generation gameplay and styleThe gameplay of Resistance is classic First Person Shooter. Insomniac Games has combined its passion for creating exotic weapons and vehicles with a proprietary physics system to create unique human and alien weaponry. Many of the weapons of the game are era-appropriate, such as pistols and grenades. Other weapons, such as the Chimeran Auger, are of alien design. Due to the differences in the ways that the various weapons handle, great care must be taken when entering an area infested with Chimera with their own weaponry. In addition to the obvious array of weapons, players can use melee attacks and jump to avoid attack.Special game actions, called \"Skill Tasks,\" are worth set number of points that can be spent to unlock new content in the game. A Skill Task may be something as simple as killing a number of enemies in a short period of time or as involved as locating a hidden area in the single player campaign. The mystery of the tasks, however, is that they aren't actually revealed until you have completed the task. This makes for a great reply incentive, as you will be mowing down Chimera and be suddenly rewarded with task points, often when you least expect the reward.Obviously, presentation is one of the areas in which Resistance shines. The frame rate is silky-smooth, and never seems to get bogged down when there is a large number of Chimera or teammates on screen. Animations are believable, the locations are detailed, and the voice acting is top-notch. Explosions are especially impressive, sending shrapnel and smoke in all directions. If you're looking for a game to impress your friends with graphically, look no further. Resistance is the type of game that makes you feel confident about the future of the PLAYSTATION 3.Track stats and more onlineResistance also boasts an impressive 40 player online multiplayer mode. It's not uncommon to find large-scale battles with both intricate strategy and simple \"run and gun\" play styles.

        "B0000A9Y11": "Many decried the original Game Boy Advance's reflective LCD screen and its reliance on external light sources. The Game Boy Advance SP's main feature--optional backlighting--fixes this complaint nicely, but it's the wealth of other features that makes this system so surprisingly good.At first look, you might think the SP is a sleek travel alarm clock. When closed, it's just as tall and deep as the original GBA, but only half as wide. Due to its clamshell design, the screen is always protected from everyday scratches. A small button in the center of the console turns on the backlighting element for use in low-light situations, like in a moving car.The SP comes with a well-designed power adapter that recharges a built-in battery; its prongs fold in for easier storage. Our informal tests found that it takes about four hours to fully charge (you can even play it while it's plugged in and charging), and the battery lasts about 11 hours with the backlighting constantly on--your results may vary. Using the backlighting less often will conserve battery power.Withseparately sold  cables, you can connect the Game Boy Advance SP to other GBAs  for multiplayer gaming (above) or to theNintendo GameCube(below) to access secret levels, exchange data, or use other special  features that vary from game to game.The quality of the backlighting is very good. It's bright and clear when looking directly at it, but degraded from other angles. This is only a problem for friends who are watching the screen from over your shoulder.But size, power, and affordability do not come without trade offs. There's no headphone jack here, though Nintendo promises an adapter. The system isn't very loud at its highest volume, and the sound can be turned down to socially acceptable levels. The L and R shoulder buttons are a fraction of the size they were on the GBA, and thus are harder to hit. Also, the reduced size of the SP is slightly less comfortable for adult hands than the GBA, but perhaps more comfortable for smaller hands. The cartridge port placement on the lower part of the console is fine for GBA games, since they are flush with the console body, but older Game Boy Color carts will stick out in a way that takes some getting used to.Open it up and the hinge will seek out a preferred, pre-set angle (about 150 degrees), though you can open it a bit wider or narrower for your own comfort. The hinge stands up well to lateral pressure, and over all, the SP seems just as rugged as its predecessor--which has proven to be very rugged, indeed.--Porter B.

        "0061438456": "Frank (Sullivan's Island) creates a world in which aspiring writer Beth Hayes, whose chirpy internal monologues and quiet uncertainties make her easily endearing, is as much a character as the house she lives in. After graduating from college in Boston, Beth returns to the South to spend a year house-sitting her family's home, Island Gamble, while her mother, Susan, visits Paris. Frank's portrayal of a large and complicated family is humorous and precise: there's Susan, adoring and kind; Aunt Maggie, a stickler for manners; twin aunts Sophie and Allison, who run an exercise-and-vitamin empire; and uncles Timmy and Henry, the latter of whom has ties to Beth's trust fund. Frank's lovable characters occasionally stymie her pace; there's almost no room left for Beth's friends or her love affairs with sleazy Max Mitchell and cherubic Woody Morrison, though these become important later on. Frank is frequently funny, and she weaves in a dark undercurrent that incites some surprising late-book developments. Tight storytelling, winsomely oddball characters and touches of Southern magic make this a winner.(July)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But if his cyberpunk classic was big,Cryptonomiconis huge... gargantuan... massive, not just in size (a hefty 918 pages including appendices) but in scope and appeal. It's the hip, readable heir toGravity's Rainbowandthe Illuminatus trilogy. And it's only the first of a proposed series--for more information, readour interview with Stephenson.Cryptonomiconzooms all over the world, careening conspiratorially back and forth between two time periods--World War II and the present. Our 1940s heroes are the brilliant mathematician Lawrence Waterhouse, cryptanalyst extraordinaire, and gung ho, morphine-addicted marine Bobby Shaftoe. They're part of Detachment 2702, an Allied group trying to break Axis communication codes while simultaneously preventing the enemy from figuring out that their codes have been broken. Their job boils down to layer upon layer of deception. Dr. Alan Turing is also a member of 2702, and he explains the unit's strange workings to Waterhouse. \"When we want to sink a convoy, we send out an observation plane first.... Of course, to observe is not itsrealduty--we already know exactly where the convoy is. Itsrealduty isto be observed.... Then, when we come round and sink them, the Germans will not find it suspicious.\"All of this secrecy resonates in the present-day story line, in which the grandchildren of the WWII heroes--inimitable programming geek Randy Waterhouse and the lovely and powerful Amy Shaftoe--team up to help create an offshore data haven in Southeast Asia and maybe uncover some gold once destined for Nazi coffers. To top off the paranoiac tone of the book, the mysterious Enoch Root, key member of Detachment 2702 and theSocietas Eruditorum, pops up with an unbreakable encryption scheme left over from WWII to befuddle the 1990s protagonists with conspiratorial ties.Cryptonomiconis vintage Stephenson from start to finish: short on plot, but long on detail so precise it's exhausting. Every page has a math problem, a quotable in-joke, an amazing idea, or a bit of sharp prose.Cryptonomiconis also packed with truly weird characters, funky tech, and crypto--all the crypto you'll ever need, in fact, not to mention all the computer jargon of the moment.

Tell us about them, and why you decided to write about them?James Rollins:First of all, I wanted to honor these unique American heroes. Tucker Wayne is a former captain with the Army Rangers. After two tours of duty in Afghanistan, he leaves the service disillusioned after a bloody battle. Aided by members of his own unit, Tucker steals his war dog, Kane.What I liked best about exploring this pair's unique relationship is a phrase commonly used by military war dog handlers--It runs down the lead--describing how the emotions of the pair became shared over time, binding them together as firmly as any leash. And it's that bond and ability for the two to operate as one that I wanted to explore in this novel.Q:Can you tell us about your research into military dogs?JR:About a year and half ago, I was lucky enough to participate in a USO tour of authors to military bases in Iraq and Kuwait. There, I saw several of these war dogs in action. I was also able to meet and talk to a veterinary school classmate of mine who works with the veterinary corps out in Iraq. After that encounter, it got me thinking about writing this book, of honoring these unique war heroes on the page.Q:Women play a large role inBloodline. How are you able to write from the point of view of women so well?JR:I have three sisters who make sure I get those details correct, but also during my USO tour to Iraq and Kuwait, I got a chance to talk at length to women in the field--to hear what it's like to be a female in the armed services. And that'[s something I tried to capture accurately.Q:Your novels always delve into the cutting edge of science. What is the scientific basis behindBloodline?JR:The root of this book came from a recent article inTimemagazine. The cover declared:2045, the Year Man Becomes Immortal. I read that and wondered how that could become true. Could immortality be achievable in our lifetime? It sent me into a yearlong and chilling investigation into the frontiers of life extension.Q:What are some of these new discoveries involving immortality?JR:I've learned that there are actually two competing schools of study when it comes to the search for immortality. On one side, scientists are looking at moving man into machines, moving our consciousness into a synthetic arena. Scientists in Switzerland right now are working with IBM to create the firstvirtualhuman brain and say they are about a decade off from achieving this goal.On the other side of the scientific fence, researchers are also looking at moving machines into us: basically replacing our failing parts with artificial organs. We already have synthetic pancreases and mechanical hearts, and these scientific advancements continue to accelerate, especially with the explosive growth of nanotechnology, which involves engineering at the atomic level.Q:Now to the last and most pressing question: How close are we to achieving immortality?JR:That's a good question--and the answer is the most startling revelation I discovered while researching this story, something I share within the pages of this book. InBloodline, readers will learn a shocking scientific truth about the nature of mankind: That immortal beings already walk among us today.If you want to know who they are, if you want to learn how to live forever--readBloodline.",

Eph, who is joined by Setrakian and a motley crew of fighters, must now find a way to stop the contagion and save his city--a city that includes his wife and son--before it is too late.The Strain: Chapter One\"Once upon a time,\" said Abraham Setrakian&rsquo;s grandmother, \"there was a giant.\"Young Abraham&rsquo;s eyes brightened, and immediately the cabbage borscht in the wooden bowl got tastier, or at least less garlicky. He was a pale boy, underweight and sickly. His grandmother, intent on fattening him, sat across from him while he ate his soup, entertaining him by spinning a yarn.Abubbeh meiseh, a \"grandmother&rsquo;s story.\" A fairy tale. A legend.\"He was the son of a Polish nobleman. And his name was Jusef Sardu. Master Sardu stood taller than any other man. Taller than any roof in the village. He had to bow deeply to enter any door. But his great height, it was a burden. A disease of birth, not a blessing. The young man suffered. His muscles lacked the strength to support his long, heavy bones. At times it was a struggle for him just to walk. He used a cane, a tall stick--taller than you--with a silver handle carved into the shape of a wolf&rsquo;s head, which was the family crest.\"\"Yes, Bubbeh?\" said Abraham, between spoonfuls.\"This was his lot in life, and it taught him humility, which is a rare thing indeed for a nobleman to possess. He had so much compassion-- for the poor, for the hardworking, for the sick. He was especially dear to the children of the village, and his great, deep pockets--the size of turnip sacks--bulged with trinkets and sweets. He had not much of a childhood himself, matching his father&rsquo;s height at the age of eight, and surpassing him by a head at age nine. His frailty and his great size were a secret source of shame to his father. But Master Sardu truly was a gentle giant, and much beloved by his people. It was said of him that Master Sardu looked down on everyone, yet looked down on no one.\"She nodded at him, reminding him to take another spoonful. He chewed a boiled red beet, known as a \"baby heart\" because of its color, its shape, its capillary-like strings. \"Yes, Bubbeh?\"\"He was also a lover of nature, and had no interest in the brutality of the hunt--but, as a nobleman and a man of rank, at the age of fifteen his father and his uncles prevailed upon him to accompany them on a six-week expedition to Romania.\"\"To here, Bubbeh?\" said Abraham. \"The giant, he came here?\"\"To the north country,kaddishel. The dark forests. The Sardu men, they did not come to hunt wild pig or bear or elk. They came to hunt wolf, the family symbol, the arms of the house of Sardu. They were hunting a hunting animal. Sardu family lore said that eating wolf meat gave Sardu men courage and strength, and the young master&rsquo;s father believed that this might cure his son&rsquo;s weak muscles.\"\"Yes, Bubbeh?\"\"Their trek was long and arduous, as well as violently opposed by the weather, and Jusef struggled mightily. He had never before traveled anywhere outside his family&rsquo;s village, and the looks he received from strangers along the journey shamed him. When they arrived in the dark forest, the woodlands felt alive around him. Packs of animals roamed the woods at night, almost like refugees displaced from their shelters, their dens, nests, and lairs. So many animals that the hunters were unable to sleep at night in their camp. Some wanted to leave, but the elder Sardu&rsquo;s obsession came before all else. They could hear the wolves, crying in the night, and he wanted one badly for his son, his only son, whose gigantism was a pox upon the Sardu line. He wanted to cleanse the house of Sardu of this curse, to marry off his son, and produce many healthy heirs.\"And so it was that his father, off tracking a wolf, was the first to become separated from the others, just before nightfall on the second evening. The rest waited for him all night, and spread out to search for him after sunrise. And so it was that one of Jusef&rsquo;s cousins failed to return that evening. And so on, you see.\"\"Yes, Bubbeh?\"\"Until the only one left was Jusef, the boy giant. That next day he set out, and in an area previously searched, discovered the body of his father, and of all his cousins and uncles, laid out at the entrance to an underground cave. Their skulls had been crushed with great force, but their bodies remained uneaten--killed by a beast of tremendous strength, yet not out of hunger or fear. For what reason, he could not guess&mdash;though he did feel himself being watched, perhaps even studied, by some being lurking within that dark cave.\"Master Sardu carried each body away from the cave and buried them deep. Of course, this exertion severely weakened him, taking most of his strength. He was spent, he wasfarmutshet. And yet, alone and scared and exhausted, he returned to the cave that night, to face what evil revealed itself after dark, to avenge his forebears or die trying. This is known from a diary he kept, discovered in the woods many years later. This was his last entry.\"Continue   ReadingThe Strain",

        "0099282194": "Athena College was snoozing complacently in the Berkshires until Coleman Silk--formerly \"Silky Silk,\" undefeated welterweight pro boxer--strode in and shook the place awake. This faculty dean sacked the deadwood, made lots of hot new hires, including Yale-spawned literary-theory wunderkind Delphine Roux, and pissed off so many people for so many decades that now, in 1998, they've all turned on him. Silk's character assassination is partly owing to what the novel's narrator, Nathan Zuckerman, calls \"the Devil of the Little Place--the gossip, the jealousy, the acrimony, the boredom, the lies.\"But shocking, intensely dramatized events precipitate Silk's crisis. He remarks of two students who never showed up for class, \"Do they exist or are they spooks?\" They turn out to be black, and lodge a bogus charge of racism exploited by his enemies. Then, at 71, Viagra catapults Silk into \"the perpetual state of emergency that is sexual intoxication,\" and he ignites an affair with an illiterate janitor, Faunia Farley, 34. She's got a sharp sensibility, \"the laugh of a barmaid who keeps a baseball bat at her feet in case of trouble,\" and a melancholy voluptuousness. \"I'm back in the tornado,\" Silk exults. His campus persecutors burn him for it--and his main betrayer is Delphine Roux.In a short space, it's tough to convey the gale-force quality of Silk's rants, or the odd effect of Zuckerman's narration, alternately retrospective and torrentially in the moment. The flashbacks to Silk's youth in New Jersey are just as important as his turbulent forced retirement, because it turns out that for his entire adult life, Silk has been covering up the fact that he is a black man. (If this seems implausible, consider that the famousNew York Timesbook critic Anatole Broyard did the same thing.) Young Silk rejects both the racism that bars him from Woolworth's counter and the Negro solidarity of Howard University. \"Neither the they of Woolworth's nor the we of Howard\" is for Coleman Silk. \"Instead the raw I with all its agility.Self-discovery--thatwas the punch to the labonz....  Self-knowledge butconcealed. What is as powerful as that?\"Silk's contradictions power a great Philip Roth novel, but he's not the only character who packs a punch. Faunia, brutally abused by her Vietnam vet husband (a sketchy guy who seems to have wandered in from a lesser Russell Banks novel), scarred by the death of her kids, is one of Roth's best female characters ever. The self-serving Delphine Roux is intriguingly (and convincingly) nutty, and any number of minor characters pop in, mouth off, kick ass, and vanish, leaving a vivid sense of human passion and perversity behind. You might call it a stain.--Tim Appelo--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

(And when they saw the obvious-but-brilliant Chip Kidd-designed cover, their eyes got even brighter.) Everyone, it seems, feels a personal connection to Peanuts (a name, by the way, that Schulz always hated), but few have a sense of the artist whose small troupe of big-headed characters still lives at the center of our imagination. If some mystery about the man still remains after reading Michaelis's sharp, engaging, and level-headed biography that's no fault of the biographer--in fact, it's to his credit. Michaelis parses Schulz's particular combination of Midwestern reserve and steely determination and the strip's still-surprising balance of exuberance and misery, and he reminds us what a colossal cultural force it became, especially in the 1960s. But even as he ingeniously finds sources for Schulz's four-panel vignettes in the events of his biography, he recognizes that the true, sometimes inexplicable drama of his life took place when he sat down every day for 50 years to trace Linus's wobbly strands of hair, fill in Snoopy's black nose, and, time and again, letter the words \"Good grief.\"--Tom Nissley--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

I was on a walk on a country road in Massachusetts, thinking myopically and somewhat self-regardingly about various offenses that I felt had been perpetrated against me. I was wondering about how apparently trustworthy people could turn dangerous, or if they really had been dangerous all along, merely well-disguised, even from themselves? A standard issue college dorm question, I suppose, but the matter seemed urgent to me that year. I moved from the slightly sore subject of my personal life into the realm of imagination to keep the question alive without it hurting so much, and almost immediately I thought of the Wicked Witch of the West--admittedly, more Margaret Hamilton than L. Frank Baum--and I wondered: Was she always terrible?The momentary crisis of that year, combined with attention to acts of evil and distress in our larger world a few years later, brought me into Oz and the world ofWicked. Still, even eight years later whenWickedwas first published, I hadn't expected that the story would remain a presence in the world. I had an imagination big enough to see into every cranny of Oz, but not big enough to imagine that anyone else might get interested, and stay interested.After the story of Elphaba hit the bookstores, the national bestseller lists, the book clubs, and then the Broadway stage, the increasing attention to the story prompted me to go back and follow up the clues I had liberally sprinkled in the first book.Son of a Witchposited that Elphaba and Fiyero had an illegitimate boy, and considered the troubles he would have first growing up with the Witch as a negligent mother and then, even worse, with his negligent mother gone from his life.A Lion Among Menfollowed up with the Cowardly Lion's tale. Why the Lion and not the Tin Woodman or the Scarecrow, readers ask me. For a number of reasons, but chief among them is that the Lion is an Animal, and Elphaba's concern for the flight of talking Animals makes his life story more urgent to the themes of the Wicked Years sequence.So finally we come toOut of Oz, the fourth and I believe final book in the series. I feel both elated and elegiac to be bringing it to readers. I get to revisit characters I love--Glinda, under house arrest; the Cowardly Lion, on the run from the law; Liir, the Witch's boy; and a little girl growing up in the shadows who may be pivotal to the resolution of military and social struggle in Oz.Oh, and yes--Dorothy too. Dorothy Gale. That Dorothy. She comes on for something more than a curtain call. Face it: you always knew Dorothy was too strong a force to stay buckled down on the Kansas prairie, didn't you? No earthly gravity can hold that girl in one place for long: she defies gravity, too, only without the broomstick.Come for a visit and stay a while.

        "0060191872": "Stuart Woods's lean, taut thrillers typically feature a helping of Hollywood glitz along with a suave, sophisticated hero who gets his man and usually the girl, too. His newest is a convincing variation on that formula, featuring an eminently decent, likable hero we've met before in a couple of legal thrillers (Run Before the Wind,Grass Roots). Now Will Lee is a senator from Georgia with somewhat ambivalent aspirations to the presidency; think Bill Clinton with a stronger moral center and a more conventional marriage, to a smart, sexy wife named Kate, who happens to be a high-ranking CIA executive. When the sitting vice president, who's slated to be the party's standard-bearer in the upcoming election, tells Will in confidence that he's just been diagnosed with early Alzheimer's disease, Will decides to make the run of the title. That's good news for an imprisoned former CIA agent (think Aldrich Ames) who was Kate Lee's mentor in the agency; he knows his only possible chance for a pardon is Will's election, and he has enough dirt on the senator's rivals to blackmail them into getting out of the way. Throw in a right-wing fanatic with a long-standing grudge against Will and a determination to assassinate him before he can make it to the White House, and you have all the ingredients for a successful run at the bestseller list. But while Woods's many fans will cheer for both the author and his protagonist, that may not be enough to vault this one to the top; Will doesn't seem to have the requisite fire in the belly, and neither does Woods in what is ultimately a fairly tepid read.--Jane Adams",

What motivated you to write a novel?Del Toro:Well, it&rsquo;s a different challenge, but I've always written short stories and then, in my film work, storylines for movies (the storyline is a slightly \"freer\" form than screenplay writing) I have published some of my short stories in the past and it is my secret dream to write shivery tales for young readers. My favorite author in that sense isRoald Dahlwho mixed it free-style between the grotesque and the magical. I love the short story form as a reader but if a novel has a terse structure I find it far more immersive and fulfilling. Nevertheless some of my favorite authors, Borges,Quiroga,Saki, etc. are masters of the short story form. The novel grew out of appetite and scope.Q:You are one of the most extraordinarily imaginative and creative thinkers working in the arts today. What were some of the influences that have contributed to your success? Do you have any kind of a muse?Del Toro:Curiously enough I regularly draw more inspiration from painters and books than I do from other films.  Painters like Carlos Schwabe, Odilon Redon, Fliecien Rops, Bocklin, Freud, Bacon, Thomas Cole and many others, never fail to excite me and in the book front there are just as many authors...Dickens, does the trick every time as doesWilde,Rulfo,Quiroga, etc.Q:Many of your movies have centered on fantastical characters. Why did you choose to write your first novel about vampires?Del Toro:All of my life I&rsquo;ve been fascinated by them but always from a Naturalist's point of view.Cronos, my first movie, wanted to be a rephrasing of the genre&mdash;I love the rephrasing of an old myth.  When I tackledBlade II, I approached it with a myriad of ideas about Vampire Biology but only a few of those made it into the film. Tonally, the movie needed to be an action film and some of the biological stuff was too disturbing already...  I love the idea of the biological, the divine and the evolutionary angles to explain the origin and function of the Vampire genus. Some of my favorite books about Vampirism are treatises on Vampiric \"fact&rdquo;--books by Bernard J Hurwood,Augustin Camet, andMontague Summers.Q:There are many stories, movies, and even a television show involving vampires. The Strain Trilogy uses the idea that vampires are a plague, and that the lead hunter is a scientist from the Centers for Disease Control. What was your inspiration for this twist?Del Toro:When I was a kid I lovedThe Night Stalkerand I fell in love with the idea Matheson and Rice posited, of exploring a creature of such powerful stature through the point of view of a common worker, a man used to deal with things in a procedural way. \"Just another day at the job...\".Q:How did you and Chuck Hogan come together to write The Strain Trilogy? How does your collaboration work?Del Toro:It was a true collaboration. I had created a \"bible\" for the book. It contained most of the structural ideas and characters and Chuck then took his pass on it and invented new characters and ideas. Fet (one of my favorite characters) was completely invented by him. And then I did my pass, writing new chapters or heavily editing his pass, and then he did a pass on my pass and so on and so forth. This is the way I have co-written in the past.  I loved Chuck's style and ideas from reading his books and I specifically wanted him as a partner because he had a strong sense of reality and had NEVER written a horror book. I knew we would complete each other in the creation of this book. What surprised me is that he came up with some gruesome moments all on his own! He revealed himself to be a rather disturbed man!A Q&amp;A with Hammett Award-winner Chuck HoganQ:What most surprised you about working with Guillermo Del Toro? Has working with him impacted your own work? In your former career as a video store clerk, did you ever in your wildest dreams imagine working on a project like this&mdash;with a legend like Del Toro?Hogan:I'd never co-authored anything, nor had I published a true work of horror before, and here I was embarking on an epic trilogy with a master of the genre.  I probably should have been more intimidated--yet I felt an immediate kinship with the material, as well as true excitement at the challenge of bringing the story to life, both of which carried me through.   Guillermo is a daunting first audience, and yet an incredibly generous collaborator.  Not to mention an amazing resource:  it's just fun to have to ask him a question&mdash;say, about why the vampires run hot instead of cold&mdash;know that, not only will he take me through their intricate biology, but he will embroider the account with corroborating examples from the field of entomology, marine life, and some arcane fact about the function of human blood platelets.Q:The Town,Devils in Exile, andThe Killing Moon, probe the dark side of human nature. What draws you to this theme, and to the genre of suspense?Hogan:Crime and horror are both genres of existentialism, and I am drawn to stories of man at his extremes, of people who find themselves tested, haunted, threatened.  I believe a writer should challenge himself in his work just as he challenges the characters in his story&mdash;that anything less would be inauthentic and dishonest.  What I love aboutThe Strainis that the journey of the story takes this maxim and multiplies it by one thousand.",

With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer.

No, wait&hellip; My new book,Call Me Irresistible, is coming out on January 18, 2011, so it&rsquo;s time to talk about how wonderful I am. Except I shamefully tried to do exactly that in our last interview, which was about you and your fabulousMaybe This Time, which was such a delicious read that I devoured it in one evening. Truly. It was better than chocolate, so funny and heartwarming, which, let&rsquo;s face it, is a hard task for even the most gifted writer to pull off, but you did it, babe, and I have no idea why I tried to sabotage that interview. I&rsquo;m ashamed.Back to me. So go ahead. Ask me some questions. Make them easy. I&rsquo;m not half as smart as you. But I&rsquo;ll put my banana bread up against yours any day.Love,SusanA Letter from Jennifer Crusie to Susan Elizabeth PhillipsDear Susan,My banana bread leaves your banana bread sniveling in the pan from its inadequacy. However, I might write another book again someday and then you&rsquo;ll owe ME an interview, so I won&rsquo;t mention that. HA. And I will be Adult and not make the interview about me.Love,JennyAmazon Exclusive: Jennifer Crusie Interviews Susan Elizabeth PhillipsJennifer Crusie:Welcome to Jennifer Crusie&rsquo;s interview with her Close Personal Friend, Susan Elizabeth Phillips. I&rsquo;m Jenny Crusie and I&rsquo;m thrilled to be interviewing Susan because she&rsquo;s not only my Close Personal Friend, she&rsquo;s also the Queen of Romantic Comedy! Oh, and because she has a new book coming out. And because that&rsquo;s what Close Personal Friends do.  So Susan, tell us aboutMaybe This Time.Susan Elizabeth Phillips:Sigh&hellip; Once you tell your Close Personal Friend how much you love her book, she never lets you forget it.JC:Sorry, sorry, I meantCall Me Irresistible. What was I thinking?  Probably that &ldquo;irresistible&rdquo; is a bitch to spell, unlike &ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; &ldquo;This,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Time.&rdquo; So you have a new novel coming out FINALLY. Not that I&rsquo;ve been impatient or anything, but ye gods, woman, you have fans and none of us are getting any younger. What took you so long? And when do I get my Close Personal Friend of Susan Elizabeth Phillips copy?SEP:So glad you pointed out the difficulty of spelling &ldquo;irresistible.&rdquo;  Where was my brain? As for taking so long&hellip; Writing is hard! Didn&rsquo;t anybody ever tell you that? (An advanced copy of the book is coming to you in the mail. Along with a truly superb loaf of banana bread.)JC:Sorry, sorry, I&rsquo;m just thrilled thatCall Me Irresistibleis coming out. Finally. For one thing, I get to see some of my favorite characters again like Meg fromWhat I Did for Loveand Lucy fromFirst Lady, not to mention Ted fromFancy PantsandLady Be Good. Is it fun for you to revisit them? (Not that I care, it&rsquo;s fun for me, so bring them back anyway, that&rsquo;s what I say.) Oh, and will readers have to have read all those books to understand this one? Because if so, good marketing.SEP:I love revisiting old characters. Just like revisiting old friends. (Not that we&rsquo;re old. Or even remotely mature.) The thing about my books is that they all stand alone, even those with familiar characters. And, boy, doesCall Me Irresistiblehave a lot of familiar characters. If readers want to pick up the older books, more power to them. But they don&rsquo;t have to. That would be like homework. Except more fun.JC:You remember back when I told you not to marry Charles and you got all huffy about it? Meg does the same thing to Lucy in this book and she listens. What kind of heroine tries to break up her pal&rsquo;s wedding? (Tell Charles I said hi.)SEP:My husband&rsquo;s name is Bill, not Charles. (This interview isn&rsquo;t going nearly as well as I&rsquo;d hoped.) Meg, the heroine ofCall Me Irresistible, sees clearly what Lucy Jorik, the bride, can&rsquo;t&mdash;that Lucy and Ted Beaudine aren&rsquo;t the perfect match everyone believes them to be. Lucy flees her wedding just as she&rsquo;s supposed to be saying, &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; leaving Meg to face the wrath of Wynette, Texas&hellip; and Ted Beaudine.JC:Okay, the last time I saw Ted he was a kid, so his appeal as a leading man wasn&rsquo;t evident (cute, though) but now he sounds like The Perfect Man: a civic minded, athletic, sweet, rich genius. Did Meg turn into superwoman in between books to earn this paragon? Because I&rsquo;m feeling inadequate enough without having to live up to a Perfect Heroine.SEP:Not to worry. As you pointed out, Ted really does have it all: looks, money, charm, and that annoying genius I.Q. As for Meg&hellip; Unlike our sexy paragon of a hero, Meg is so deliciously imperfect. Kind of a screw-up, although her heart&rsquo;s in the right place. She also has big problems. She&rsquo;s broke, stranded, and unemployed in a town where everybody&rsquo;s out to get her&hellip;and where Ted Beaudine holds all the power.JC:What is it with you and Texans? Not that I have anything against Texas except, you know, politics, but you&rsquo;re practically a tumbleweed groupie. Did you have a great one-night stand there that you&rsquo;ve never quite let go of? Did you look across a room and meet the eyes of a tall, dark ranger and then Charles made you play golf? Because your erotic fascination with that state is well-documented. Give us all the details. And pictures. Pictures or it didn&rsquo;t happen.SEP:My husband&rsquo;s name is NOT CHARLES, it&rsquo;s BILL! And who are you calling a groupie? I seem to remember a certain wild night, a certain famous rocker&hellip; I&rsquo;ll say no more. As for my Texas settings&mdash;and no offense to my Lone Star friends&mdash;but that state is a writer&rsquo;s dream. You can make any dang fool thing happen in Texas and readers will believe it. Thank you Sam Houston and all your fine descendents.JC:I never had a chance to be a groupie once you told him I threw rolls at you. You asked me some really good questions in our last Amazon interview (smart, talented, and beautiful; you really do have it all, oh Queen of the RomCom), so I&rsquo;m throwing two of the best back at you: &ldquo;How do the stories you want to tell now differ from the ones you wanted to tell when you started writing? How are they the same?&rdquo;SEP:Do I detect a little sarcasm with all these Queen references? I should never have borrowed your tiara. Great, insightful questions, by the way! (Please don&rsquo;t bring up the roll incident.) My core story will, I think, always be the same. I love books that make me laugh and get a lump in my throat, sometimes on the same page. I love sexy heroes, funny heroines, and happy endings. Basically, there&rsquo;s not much difference between what I used to write and what I write now. Except now I&rsquo;m a lot better speller.JC:Thank you, Susan for these insightful and fascinating answers.  And now for our last question: WHAT&rsquo;S NEXT?  Tell me all about what you&rsquo;re working on so I can harass you so you can finish it faster and I can read it. And because I&rsquo;m a pal, proofread it.SEP:I&rsquo;m not giving too much away by saying that, by page thirty ofCall Me Irresistible, Lucy Jorik has fled her wedding, and we don&rsquo;t see her again for the rest of the book. Leaving us to wonder&hellip; Exactly what happened to our runaway bride?",

Born in the aftermath of a searing family tragedy, Bonaventure Arrow &#x201C;didn&#x2019;t make a peep when he was born.&#x201D;  Never speaking a word, his silence enables him to listen to what no one else can hear. He is not only hyper-aware of the sounds of the natural world, but he is also in tune with the clamorous echoes of  personal heartbreak and despair. Joining forces with Creole servant Trinidad Prefontaine, young Bonaventure undertakes a quest to unlock a series of family secrets to liberate himself, his dead father, and his inconsolable mother from the emotionally and spiritually paralyzing bonds of the past. This mystical fairy tail set in a 1950s-era Louisiana rife with religion, superstition, and tradition draws you in from the wondrous first page.

What she finds in Paris, however, changes everything she knew about her past and has the power to change everything about her future. Tessaro combines Grace&#x2019;s story with that of Eva d&#x2019;Orsey, muse to one of Paris&#x2019; most famous perfumers and possessor of quite a few unusual talents herself. Sliding seamlessly between the 1950s and the 1920s, Tessaro depicts New York, Paris, London, and Monte Carlo with lush, descriptive imagery and admirable authenticity. Grace is a beguiling heroine, uneasy in her current situation yet hesitant to fully uncover the connections she and Eva share.

        "0061132381": "In 2005, two tragedies--the Asian tsunami and Hurricane Katrina--turned CNN reporter Anderson Cooper into a media celebrity.Dispatches from the Edge, Cooper's memoir of \"war, disasters and survival,\" is a brief but powerful chronicle of Cooper's ascent to stardom and his struggle with his own tragedies and demons. Cooper was 10 years old when his father, Wyatt Cooper, died during heart bypass surgery. He was 20 when his beloved older brother, Carter, committed suicide by jumping off his mother's penthouse balcony (his mother, by the way, being Gloria Vanderbilt). The losses profoundly affected Cooper, who fled home after college to work as a freelance journalist for Channel One, the classroom news service. Covering tragedies in far-flung places like Burma, Vietnam, and Somalia, Cooper quickly learned that \"as a journalist, no matter ... how respectful you are, part of your brain remains focused on how to capture the horror you see, how to package it, present it to others.\" Cooper's description of these horrors, from war-ravaged Baghdad to famine-wracked Niger, is poignant but surprisingly unsentimental. In Niger, Cooper writes, he is chagrined, then resigned, when he catches himself looking for the \"worst cases\" to commit to film. \"They die, I live. It's the way of the world,\" he writes. In the final section ofDispatches, Cooper describes covering Hurricane Katrina, the story that made him famous. The transcript of his showdown with Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu (in which Cooper tells Landrieu people in New Orleans are \"ashamed of what is happening in this country right now\") is worth the price of admission on its own. Cooper's memoir leaves some questions unanswered--there's frustratingly little about his personal life, for example--but remains a vivid, modest self-portrait by a man who is proving himself to be an admirable, courageous leader in a medium that could use more like him. --Erica C.

        "0060922532": "Taylor Greer and her adopted Cherokee daughter Turtle, first met in The Bean Trees , will captivate readers anew in Kingsolver's assured and eloquent sequel, which mixes wit, wisdom and the expert skills of a born raconteur into a powerfully affecting narrative. Now six years old and still bearing psychological marks of the abuse that occured before she was rescued by Taylor, Turtle is discovered by formidable Indian lawyer Annawake Fourkiller, who insists that the child be returned to the Cherokee Nation. Taylor reacts by fleeing her Tucson home with Turtle to begin a precarious existence on the road; skirting the edge of poverty and despair, she eventually realizes that Turtle has become emotionally unmoored. In taking a fresh look at the Solomonic dilemma of choosing between two equally valid claims on a child's life, Kingsolver achieves the admirable feat of making the reader understand and sympathize with both sides of the controversy, as she contrasts Taylor's inalterable mother's love with Annawake's determination to save Turtle from the stigmatization she can expect from white society. The chronicle acquires depth and humor when Kingsolver integrates the story of Taylor's mother Alice, a woman who believes that the Greers are \"doomed to be a family with no men in it\" (that she is proven wrong adds a delicious element of romance to the story). Alice's resolve to help her daughter takes her into the heart of the Cherokee Nation and results in an astonishing but credible meshing of lives. In the end, both justice and compassion are served. Kingsolver's intelligent consideration of issues of family and culture--both in her evocation of Native American society and in her depiction of the plight of a single mother--brims with insight and empathy. Every page of this beautifully controlled narrative offers prose shimmering with imagery and honed to simple lyric intensity.

        "0060959258": "In the spring of 1988,Boston Globereporters Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill set out to write the story of two infamous brothers from the insular Irish enclave of South Boston: Jim \"Whitey\" Bulger and his younger brother Billy. Whitey was the city's most powerful gangster and a living legend--tough, cunning, without conscience, and above all, smart. Billy, president of the state Senate, was a political heavyweight in Massachusetts. These facts alone make for an intriguing story, but as Lehr and O'Neill found out, this was only the beginning.John Connolly, a rising FBI agent and fellow \"Southie,\" had known the Bulgers since boyhood when Whitey rescued him from a playground fight. After investigating organized crime in New York, Connolly was reassigned to the bureau's Boston office in 1975, and was determined to make a name for himself by relying on his old connections. He succeeded in a big way by lining up Whitey as an FBI informant in an effort to bring down the Italian Mafia--a major coup for both the FBI and Connolly. In exchange, Bulger received protection. Though heavily involved in extortion, intimidation, assassination, and drug trafficking, Connolly's \"good bad guy\" did not receive so much as a traffic infraction for over 20 years. In time, however, the deal changed, and information began flowing the other direction, with Bulger manipulating Connolly and a small group of corrupt FBI agents to further his nefarious network. The criminals and the lawmen eventually became virtually indistinguishable.Black Massexpertly details the twists and turns of this complex story, painting a vivid portrait of Boston's underbelly and its inclusive political machine, as well as exposing one of the worst scandals in FBI history. It's also an examination of loyalty--to family, home, and heritage--and \"a cautionary tale about the abuse of power that goes unchecked.\" As a final favor, Connolly tipped off Bulger that he was to be indicted on racketeering charges in 1995, allowing him time to go on the lam (he's reported to have access to secret bank accounts across the country). He was added to the FBI's \"Ten Most Wanted List\" in 1999.--Sharon M. Brown--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

Sijie's unnamed 17-year-old protagonist and his best friend, Luo, are bourgeois doctors' sons, and so condemned to serve four years in a remote mountain village, carrying pails of excrement daily up a hill. Only their ingenuity helps them to survive. The two friends are good at storytelling, and the village headman commands them to put on \"oral cinema shows\" for the villagers, reciting the plots and dialogue of movies. When another city boy leaves the mountains, the friends steal a suitcase full of forbidden books he has been hiding, knowing he will be afraid to call the authorities.

Like standard combos their purpose is to unleash maximum damage on an opponent, but unlike the combos of old, when performed correctly these long strings of punches, kicks and moves result in changes to the in-game camera angle and quick cinematics which illustrate the strength of your skills like never before. Taken together, these two new features heraldStreet Fighter IVas the new king of the fighter genre and a force to be reckoned with for years to come.",

More feminist readers, however, may find Macomber's hero, Cain Maclellan, rather irksome, as he appears to value lovely Linette Collins chiefly for her \"softness\" and gentleness. Cain's job involves rescuing various victims of Third World terrorists; and Linette, who lost her first husband to cancer, worries about her growing attraction to Cain because of his dangerous career. She does not, however, appear unduly troubled by the fact that he himself often kills others in order to achieve his objectives. Macomber (The Trouble with Angels) here throws together the traditional \"family values\" of Linette and her family and the rugged machismo of Cain and his co-workers into what ultimately seems like an uneasy mix, but her portrayal of a relationship that develops slowly and steadily despite a host of obstacles nevertheless can be convincing.Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.",

This time the lord of legal thrillers dives deep into the world of the homeless, particularly their barely audible legal voice in a world dominated by large, all-powerful law firms. Our hero, Michael Brock, is on the fast track to partnership at D.C.'s premier law firm, Sweeny & Drake. His dream of someday raking in a million-plus a year is finally within reach. Nothing can stop him, not even 90-hour workweeks and a failing marriage--until he meets DeVon Hardy, a.k.a.  &quot;Mister,&quot; a Vietnam vet with a grudge against his landlord--and a few lawyers to fry. Hardy, with no clear motive, takes Brock and eight of his colleagues hostage in a boardroom, demanding their tax returns and interrogating them with a conviction that would have put perpetrators of the Spanish Inquisition to shame. Hardy, a man of few words and a lot of ammunition, mumbles cryptically, &quot;Who are the evictors?&quot; as he points a .44 automatic within inches of Brock's face. The violent outcome of the hostage situation triggers an abrupt soul-searching for the young lawyer, and Hardy's mysterious question continues to haunt him. Brock learns that Hardy had been in and out of homeless shelters most of his life, but he had recently begun paying rent in a rundown building; that means he has legal recourse when a big money-making outfit such as Sweeny & Drake boots him with no warning. When Brock realizes that his profession caters to the morally challenged, he sets out on an aimless search through the dicier side of D.C., ending up at the 14th Street Legal Clinic. The clinic's director, a gargantuan man named Mordecai Green, woos Brock to the clinic with a $90,000 cut in pay and the chance to redeem his soul. Brock takes it--and some of the story's credibility along with it; it's hard to believe that a Yale graduate who sacrificed everything--including his marriage--to succeed in the legal profession would quickly jump at the opportunity for low-paying, charitable work. However, Brock's search for corruption in the swanky upper echelons of Sweeny & Drake (via the toughest streets of D.C.) is filled with colorful characters and realistic, gritty descriptions.

It's already here, living in the head of the guy who just crossed the street in front of you, or maybe even closer than that. We saw these possibilities get played out in the author's bloodsporting-anarchist-yuppie shocker of a first novel,Fight Club.  Now, inSurvivor, his second and newest, the concern is more for the origin of the malaise. Starting at chapter 47 and screaming toward ground zero, Palahniuk hurls the reader back to the beginning in a breathless search for where it all went wrong. This time out, the author's protagonist is self-made, self-ruined mogul-messiah Tender Branson, the sole passenger of a jet moments away from slamming first into the Australian outback and then into oblivion. All that will be left, Branson assures us with a tone bordering on relief, is his life story, from its Amish-on-acid cult beginnings to its televangelist-huckster end.

With mind-boggling improvements in graphics, gameplay networking, and interface -- really every category -- this game became the crown prince of the genre. World of Warcraft players will be excited by the approaching release of the new expansion pack:World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade. This pack expands the already massive, award-winning multiplayer online role-playing game by tremendous bounds, adding new races, lands, battlegrounds, professions and items, and much, much more.

There are two new playable races, including the magical Blood Elves that you can read more about below. The other race has not yet been released by Blizzard. There will be new starting zones in Quel'Thalas and beyond. Another eye-opening addition is the entirely new, unexplored continent of Outland that is reachable through the Dark Portal. Plus, you'll find many new high-level dungeons to explore in Azeroth, Outland, and elsewhere that will substantially boost gameplay. There are new flying mounts in Outland; tons of new and dangerous monsters (including epic world bosses); hundreds of new quests and items; and even a new profession: Jewelcrafting. Of course this isn't the end of the list -- this is just a glimpse of what Blizzard has planned for their unreleased expansion pack.The New Story, the Rumors, and MoreSeveral years have passed since the Burning Legion's defeat at Mount Hyjal and the races of Azeroth have continued to rebuild their once shattered lives. With renewed strength, the heroes of the Horde and Alliance have begun to explore new lands, and have broken through the Dark Portal to investigate the realms beyond the known world. In this expansion pack,The Burning Crusaderefers to the Burning Legion's ongoing efforts to destroy life on Azeroth. To date, the Burning Legion's exploits have been documented inWarcraft IIIand in theWar of the Ancientsnovel trilogy. As part of the expansion pack, players will now be able to travel through the Dark Portal to confront the Legion on otherworldly battlefields.Although only one race has been revealed, Blizzard has announced plans to unveil details about possible additional races at a later date. On the other hand, many details have been released about the new continent, Outland. Players last visited Outland inWarcraft III: The Frozen Throne, alongside Illidan as he conquered the Pit Lord Magtheridon's domain. Players will also gain access to Quel'Thalas, the region to the northeast of the Forsaken lands, where the Blood Elves reside. Blizzard says that this expansion pack holds even more new areas that are ripe for player exploration -- additional details will be revealed in the months ahead.Blizzard also has plans to add new dungeons and battlegrounds with the expansion, though the exact number has not yet been determined. One upcoming dungeon that has players excited is Karazhan, which is located within Medivh's tower. Because Medivh has played such a central role in Warcraft lore, Blizzard is convinced that longtime players will be especially interested in seeing what Karazhan contains. As for battlegrounds, Blizzard has released very little information. However, they have announced plans to make some of the battles from the past accessible through the Caverns of Time.Blood Elves: The New RaceThousands of years ago, the exiled Highborne landed on the shores of Lordaeron and founded the enchanted kingdom of Quel'Thas. These high elves, as they called themselves, created a fountain of vast, magical energies within the heart of their land -- the Sunwell. Over time, they grew dependant on the Sunwell's unstable energies, regardless of the bitter lessons they'd learned in ages past.During the Third War, the villainous Prince Arthas invaded Quel'Thalas and reduced the once-mighty realm to rubble and ashes. His undead army decimated nearly all of the high elven population. In addition, he used the Sunwell's energies to resurrect a powerful undead Lich, Kel'thuzad, thereby fouling the Sunwell's mystical waters. The few elven survivors, realizing that they had been cut off from the source of their arcane power, grew increasingly volatile and desperate.In the midst of the elves' darkest hour came Kael'thas Sunstrider, the last of Quel'Thalas' royal bloodline. Kael, as he was commonly known, knew that the remnant of his people would not long survive without the nourishing magic that once empowered them. Renaming his people \"blood elves\" in honor of their fallen countrymen, Kael taught the survivors how to tap into ambient mystical energies -- even demonic energies -- in order to sate their terrible thirst for magic. In search of a new destiny for his people, Kael'thas ventured to the remote world of Outland where he encountered the fallen night elf, Illidan. Under Illidan's watchful eye, Kael and his blood elves regained much of their former power.Unfortunately, the blood elves practice of embracing demonic energies caused their former comrades in the Alliance to shun them. Thus, the remaining blood elves on Azeroth look desperately to the Horde to help them reach Outland where they can reunite with Kael'thas and achieve the golden destiny he has promised them.Outland: The New ContinentOnce the beautiful homeworld of the orcs, all that remains of Draenor is the scattered wastes of Outland. Following the Second War, the Alliance invaded Draenor by crossing through the Dark Portal. To their horror, they discovered that Ner'zhul -- the dark warlord of Horde -- had constructed a series of new gateways that could lead the beaten Horde to newer, unspoiled worlds. As the Alliance forces closed in around him, Ner'zhul opened his gateways as a means of escape. However, his plan backfired and the gateway's clashing energies resulted in a massive catastrophic explosion that ultimately ripped the world of Draenor to pieces.Nearly thirteen years later -- towards the end of the Third War -- the fallen night elf, Illidan, discovered that huge chunks of Draenor still existed, floating upon the astral winds of the Twisting Nether. After his defeat at the hands of the evil Prince Arthas, Illidan fled to the remnants of Draenor and dubbed them \"Outland.\" He quickly seized control of the chaotic region and sealed the last of Ner'zhul's gateways.Though he is the undisputed ruler of the ravaged land, Illidan lives in fear that he will be discovered by his powerful enemies -- most notably Arthas, the new Lich King, and the remaining Lords of the Burning Legion. For now, Outland is home to a number of scattered draenei tribes, primitive orcs, and powerful, arcane creatures of the Nether itself. Agents of the Burning Legion have also targeted the region as a vital strategic location in their unending Burning Crusade to scour all life from the universe.What else can expected? Blizzard has tantalized Warcraft players with the brief glimpse intoThe Burning Crusade'sstoryline. Will these heroes find friends or foes? What dangers and rewards lie in wait beyond the Dark Portal? And what will they do when they discover that the demons they thought were vanquished have returned to renew their terrible Burning Crusade? These and other questions will remain unanswered until the gameplay can be explored by role-playing Warcrafters.System RequirementsMinimumRecommendedOperating SystemPC: Microsoft Windows XP or Windows Vista (with latest Service Packs)Mac: Mac OS X 10.4.11 or newerCPUPC: Intel Pentium 4 1.3 GHz or AMD Athlong XP 1500+Mac: PowerPC G5 1.6 GHz or Intel Core Duo processorPC: Dual-core processor, such as Intel Pentium D or AmD Athlong 64 X2Mac: Intel 1.8 GHz processor or betterGraphics HardwarePC: 3D graphics processor with Hardware Transfor and Lighting with 32 MB VRAM, such as an ATI Radeon 7200 or NVIDIA GeForce2 class card or betterMac: 3D graphics processor with Hardware Transform and Lighting with 64 MB VRAM, such as ATI Radeon 9600 or NVIDIA GeForce Ti 4600 class card or betterPC: 3D Graphics processor with Vertex and Pixel Shader capabilities with 128 MB VRAM, such as an ATI Radeon X1600 or NVIDIA GeForce 7600 GT class card or betterMac: 3D graphics processor with Vertex and Pixel Shader capability with 128 MB VRAM, such as ATI Radeon X1600 or NVIDIA 7600 class card or better.MemoryPC: 512 MB (1 GB for Vista)Mac: 1 GBPC: 1 GB (2 GB for Vista)Mac: 2 GBHard Drive Space15 GB of free spaceAll Platform RequirementsKeyboard and mouse, required for controls.

        "0007410956": "Amazon Best Books of the Month, May 2011:  Near the end of World War II, a plane carrying 24 members of the United States military, including nine Women&#x2019;s Army Corps (WAC) members, crashed into the New Guinea jungle during a sightseeing excursion. 21 men and women were killed. The three survivors--a beautiful WAC, a young lieutenant who lost his twin brother in the crash, and a severely injured sergeant--were stranded deep in a jungle valley notorious for its cannibalistic tribes. They had no food, little water, and no way to contact their military base. The story of their survival and the stunning efforts undertaken to save them are the crux ofLost in Shangri-La, Mitchell Zuckoff&#x2019;s remarkable and inspiring narrative. Faced with the potential brutality of the Dani tribe, known throughout the valley for its violence, the trio&#x2019;s lives were dependent on an unprecedented rescue mission--a dedicated group of paratroopers jumped into the jungle to provide aid and medical care, consequently leaving the survivors and paratroopers alike trapped on the jungle floor. A perilous rescue by plane became their only possible route to freedom. A riveting story of deliverance under the most unlikely circumstances,Lost in Shangri-Ladeserves its place among the great survival stories of World War II.--Lynette MongAmazon Exclusive: Hampton Sides ReviewsLost in Shangri-LaHampton Sidesis the editor-at-large forOutsidemagazine and the author of the international bestsellerGhost Soldiers, which won the 2002 PEN USA Award for nonfiction and the 2002 Discover Award from Barnes &amp; Noble, and also served as the basis for the 2005 Miramax filmThe Great Raid.Although World War II was the greatest conflict in the history of this planet, many a jaded reader has come to the reluctant conclusion that there aren&rsquo;t any more World War II stories left to tell. At least not good ones&mdash;not tales of the &ldquo;ripping good yarn&rdquo; variety. Yet remarkably, in his new bookLost in Shangri-La, Mitchell Zuckoff has found one, and he&rsquo;s told it with reportorial verve, narrative skill, and exquisite pacing.What makes this World War II story all the more fascinating is that it isn&rsquo;t really a war story&mdash;not in a strict military sense. It&rsquo;s more of an exotic adventure tale with rich anthropological shadings. In 1945, near the end of the war, an American plane crashes in a hidden jungle valley in New Guinea inhabited by Stone Age cannibals. 21 Americans die in the crash, but three injured survivors soon find themselves stumbling through the jungle without food, nursing terrible wounds and trying to elude Japanese snipers known to be holding out in the mountains.The first contact between the three Americans and the valley&rsquo;s Dani tribesmen is both poignant and comical. The Americans, Zuckoff writes, have &ldquo;crash-landed in a world that time didn&rsquo;t forget. Time never knew it existed.&rdquo; The tribesmen, who have never encountered metal and have yet to master the concept of the wheel, think the American interlopers are white spirits who&rsquo;ve descended on a vine from heaven, fulfilling an ancient legend. They&rsquo;re puzzled and fascinated by the layers of &ldquo;removable skin&rdquo; in which these alien visitors are wrapped; the natives, who smear their bodies in pig grease and cover their genitals with gourds, have never seen clothes before.The Americans, in turn, are pretty sure their boartusk-bestudded hosts want to skewer them for dinner.What ensues in Zuckoff&rsquo;s fine telling is not so much a cultural collision as a pleasing and sometimes hilarious mutual unraveling of assumptions. Though the differences in the two societies are chasmic, the Americans and the Dani become&mdash;in a guarded, tentative sort of way&mdash;friends.But when armed American airmen arrive via parachute to rescue the survivors, relations become more tense. The Americans make their camp right in the middle of a no-man&rsquo;s land between warring Dani tribes&mdash;a no-man&rsquo;s land where for centuries they have fought the battles that are central to their daily culture. Here, Zuckoff notes, the ironies are profoundly rich. The Dani, untouched by and indeed utterly unaware of the great war that&rsquo;s been raging all across the globe, become thoroughly discombobulated when their own war is temporarily disrupted.Yes, therearestill a few good World War II stories left to tell. And yes, this one meets all the requirements of a ripping good yarn. Zuckoff, who teaches journalism at Boston University, is a first-rate reporter who has spared no expense to rescue this tale from obscurity. His story has it all: Tragedy, survival, comedy, an incredibly dangerous eleventh-hour rescue, and an immensely attractive heroine to boot. It&rsquo;s extraordinary that Hollywood hasn&rsquo;t already taken this tale and run wild with it. If it did, the resulting movie would be equal partsAlive,Cast Away, andThe Gods Must Be Crazy. It&rsquo;s as though the Americans have arrived in the Stone Age through a wormhole in the space-time continuum. The Dani don&rsquo;t know what to do with themselves&mdash;and life, as any of us know it, will never be the same.--This text refers to theHardcoveredition.",
        "006135323X": "Irrational behavior is a part of human nature, but as MIT professor Ariely has discovered in 20 years of researching behavioral economics, people tend to behave irrationally in a predictable fashion. Drawing on psychology and economics, behavioral economics can show us why cautious people make poor decisions about sex when aroused, why patients get greater relief from a more expensive drug over its cheaper counterpart and why honest people may steal office supplies or communal food, but not money. According to Ariely, our understanding of economics, now based on the assumption of a rational subject, should, in fact, be based on our systematic, unsurprising irrationality. Ariely argues that greater understanding of previously ignored or misunderstood forces (emotions, relativity and social norms) that influence our economic behavior brings a variety of opportunities for reexamining individual motivation and consumer choice, as well as economic and educational policy. Ariely's intelligent, exuberant style and thought-provoking arguments make for a fascinating, eye-opening read.(Feb.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The author is off to a good start with the tale of how Vivi, Teensy, Caro and Necie met as little girls in 1930, their spunk and liveliness a harbinger of things to come. But the focus on the Ya-Yas' early years soon wavers and the novel is all over the map&mdash;here a few tales about the grown-up Ya-Yas, like Vivi's run-in with her son's first-grade teacher, a pompous nun; there a story about Vivi's eldest daughter, Sidda, one of the so-called \"Petites Ya-Yas,\" and her directorial debut at age eight at a Valentine's Day party. A chapter appears out of nowhere from the viewpoint of Myrtis Spevey, a contemporary of the original Ya-Yas, who is so excessively jealous and resentful of the friends that she comes off as a cartoon character. After a vexing 30-year leap, Myrtis's creepy, emotionally ill daughter, Edythe, takes over the narrative, kidnapping one of the Ya-Yas' grandchildren. What begins as a collection of haphazard but entertaining snippets from the Ya-Yas' lives suddenly bumps up against a sober story about a missing child and the lengths to which parents will go to protect their young. Readers may lose patience as even the loose family-album format fails to hold up, but Wells still charms when she focuses on the redemptive power of family love and the special bond that comes from genuine, long-lived friendship.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0006476155": "This second big winter thriller by a writer named Patterson (see Fiction Forecasts, Oct. 19) features a villain (a multiple-personality serial killer/kidnapper) whom the publisher hopes will remind readers of Thomas Harris's Hannibal Lecter, and a hero who is compared to those of Jonathan Kellerman. Unfortunately, the novel has few merits of its own to set against those authors' works. Hero Alex Cross is in fact a black senior detective in Washington, D.C., who is also a psychiatrist and has a facile but not entirely convincing line of sentimental-cynical patter. The villain is Gary Soneji/Murphy (read Hyde/Jekyll), who kills for recognition, and finally kidnaps the kids of prominent parents. Alex is soon on the case, more enraged by Gary's killing of poor ghetto blacks than by the Lindbergh-inspired kidnapping, and becomes involved with a gorgeous, motorcycle-riding Secret Service supervisor who is not what she seems. Soneji/Murphy is eventually captured--but can the bad part of him be proven guilty? There is even a hint at the end that he may survive for a sequel, though the reader has virtually forgotten him by then. Spider reads fluently enough, but its action and characters seem to have come out of some movie-inspired never-never land. If a contemporary would-be nail-biter is to thrill as it should, it urgently needs stronger connections to reality than this book has.

Despite Gittleman's assertion that the plan is \"as easy as 1-2-3,\" it is quite regimented. No white flour, white sugar, margarine, vegetable shortening, artificial sweeteners, or caffeine. The diet emphasizes essential oils (e.g., flaxseed and GLA), protein (eight ounces or more, plus two eggs a day), vegetables, thermogenic spices (e.g., ginger and cayenne), water, and diuretic beverages (eight glasses/day of diluted, unsweetened cranberry juice). In its first two-week phase, the plan is a rigid, low calorie (1,100-1,200 calories/day), low-carb (no grains or starchy vegetables) diet. Phase two lets you increase your calories to 1,500 and add two \"friendly carbs.\" Phase three, the \"lifestyle program,\" moderately adds more dairy, carbs, and calories.

Their role is to nurture all knowledge while safeguarding it from the vagaries of the irrational saecular outside world. Among the monastic scholars is 19-year-old Raz, collected into the concent at age eight and now a decenarian, or tenner (someone allowed contact with the world beyond the stronghold walls only once a decade). But millennia-old rules are cataclysmically shattered when extraterrestrial catastrophe looms, and Raz and his teenage companions&mdash;engaging in intense intellectual debate one moment, wrestling like rambunctious adolescents the next&mdash;are summoned to save the world.

        "0060742690": "Imagine how strange and frightening it would be to see a picture of yourself, not quite a year old, with your mother and two men, one of whom is a confessed serial killer.  This is what happened to Sebastian Junger, and only a small part of what he recounts inA Death in Belmont.The quiet suburb of Belmont, Massacuusetts, is in the grip of fear. The Boston Strangler murders have taken place nearby, and now there is another shocking sex crime, right in Belmont. The victim is Bessie Goldberg, a middle-aged woman who had hired a cleaning man to help out around the house on that fall day in 1963. He is a black man named Roy Smith.  He did the appointed chores, collected his money and left a receipt on the kitchen table.  Neighbors will say that he looked furtive when he walked down the street, that he was in a hurry, that he stopped to buy cigarettes, that he looked over his shoulder.  They didn't see a black man in Belmont very often, so, of course, they noticed him. So the story went, and on these slender threads, and his own checkered history, Roy Smith is convicted of the Belmont murder and sent to prison.On the day of the murder, Albert DeSalvo, an Italian-American handyman, is also in Belmont, working as a carpenter in the Junger home, where the picture is taken. Two years after his work for the Jungers, he confesses in vivid detail to the crimes of which the Boston Strangler is accused, and sent to prison, where he is stabbed to death by an inmate.  But he never confesses to the Bessie Goldberg murder.  Could he have left the Junger home, committed the murder a few blocks away and calmly returned to finish his day's work?  Could Roy Smith really have been the guilty party, even though his sentence was commuted after De Salvo confessed?In the grand tradition of his bestsellingThe Perfect Storm, Junger tells a terrific story, lining up all the elements, asking all the pertinent questions, digging into the backgrounds of both men, retelling his mother's very strange encounter with Albert when she is home alone with Sebastian.  He then asks the larger questions:  Was Roy Smith convicted summarily because he was black?  Was Albert De Salvo really the Boston Strangler?Junger cannot answer all the questions, as no one can.  Without DNA, there is no way to be certain of which of the two men might have committed the rape and murder of Bessie Goldberg, or if neither of them is guilty.  While it is frustrating not to know for sure, the story is fascinating, reads like a tautly plotted mystery thriller, and Junger's close connection is downright creepy.--Valerie Ryan--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",
        "0060975776": "The unnamed narrator inJesus' Sonlives through a  car wreck and a heroin overdose. Is he blessed? He cheats, lies, steals--but possesses a child's (or a mystic's) uncanny way of expressing the bare essence of things around him. In its own strange and luminous way, this linked collection of short fiction does the same. The stories follow  characters who are seemingly marginalized beyond hope, drifting through a narcotic haze of ennui, failed relationships, and petty crime. In \"Dundun\" the narrator decides to take a shooting victim to the hospital, though not for the usual reasons: \"I wanted to be the one who saw it through and got McInnes to the doctor without a wreck. People would talk about it, and I hoped I would be liked.\" Later he takes his own pathetic stab at violence in \"The Other Man,\" attempting to avenge a drug rip-off but succeeding only at terrorizing an innocent family. Each meandering story--some utterly lacking in the usual elements of plot, including a beginning and an end--nonetheless demands compulsive reading, with Denis  Johnson's first calling as a poet apparent in the off-kilter beauty of his prose. Open to any page and gems spill forth: \"I knew every raindrop by its name. I sensed everything before it happened. I knew a certain Oldsmobile would stop for me even before it slowed, and by the sweet voices of the family inside that we'd have an accident in the storm.\"The most successful stories in the collection offer moments of startling clarity. In \"Car Crash While Hitchhiking,\" for instance, the narrator feels most  alive while in the presence of another's loss: \"Down the hall came the wife. She was glorious, burning. She didn't know yet that her husband was dead....  What a pair of lungs! She shrieked as I imagined an eagle would shriek. It felt wonderful to be alive to hear it! I've gone looking for that feeling everywhere.\" In \"Work,\" while \"salvaging\" copper wire from a flooded house to fund their habits, the narrator and an acquaintance stop to watch the nearly unfathomable sight of a beautiful, naked woman paragliding up the river. Later the narrator learns that the house once belonged to his down-and-out accomplice and that the woman is his estranged wife. \"As nearly as I could tell, I'd wandered into some sort of dream that Wayne was having about his wife, and his house,\" he reasons. Such is the experience for the reader. More Genet than Bukowski, Denis Johnson lures us into a misfit soul's dream from which he can't awake.--Langdon Cook",

Public-awareness campaigns to discourage consumptionB. Cap-and-trade agreements on carbon emissionsC. Volcanic explosionsD. Planting lots of treesQuestion 9:5 pointsIn the 19th century, one of the gravest threats of childbearing was puerperal fever, which was often fatal to mother and child.  Its cause was finally determined to be:A. Tight bindings of petticoats early in the pregnancyB. Foul air in the delivery wardsC. Doctors not taking sanitary precautionsD. The mother rising too soon in the delivery roomQuestion 10:3 pointsWhich of the following were not aftereffects of the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks on September 11, 2001:A. The decrease in airline traffic slowed the spread of influenza.B. Thanks to extra police in Washington, D.C., crime fell in that city.C. The psychological effects of the attacks caused people to cut back on their consumption of alcohol, which led to a decrease in traffic accidents.D. The increase in border security was a boon to some California farmers, who, as   Mexican and Canadian imports declined, sold so much marijuana that it became one of the states most valuable crops.Answers and ScoringQuestion 1B, Cable and satellite TV. Women with television were less willing to tolerate wife beating, less likely to admit to having a &#x201C;son preference,&#x201D; and more likely to exercise personal autonomy. Plus, the men were perhaps too busy watching cricket.Question 2A, Saturday nights are the most profitable. While Friday nights are the busiest, the single greatest determinant of a prostitute&#x2019;s price is the specific trick she is hired to perform. And for whatever reason, Saturday customers purchase more expensive services.Question 3C, One factor that doesn&#x2019;t seem to matter is whether a doctor is highly rated by his or her colleagues. Those named as best by their colleagues turned out to be no better than average at lowering death rates--although they did spend less money on treatments.Question 4C, Leukemia.  Chemotherapy has proven effective on some cancers, including leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin&#x2019;s disease, and testicular cancer, especially if these cancers are detected early. But in most cases, chemotherapy is remarkably ineffective, often showing zero discernible effect. That said, cancer drugs make up the second-largest category of pharmaceutical sales, with chemotherapy comprising the bulk.Question 5A, Inexpensive drugs. Expensive medical procedures, while technologically dazzling, are responsible for a remarkably small share of the improvement in heart disease. Roughly half of the decline has come from reductions in risk factors like high cholesterol and high blood pressure, both of which are treated with relatively inexpensive drugs. And much of the remaining decline is thanks to ridiculously inexpensive treatments like aspirin, heparin, ACE inhibitors, and beta-blockers.Question 6False. Based on extensive data analysis as well as crash tests paid for by the authors, old-fashioned seat belts do just as well as car seats.Question 7B, Shifting less than one day per week&#x2019;s worth of calories from red meat and dairy products to chicken, fish, eggs, or a vegetable-based diet achieves more greenhouse-gas reduction than buying all locally sourced food, according to a recent study by Christopher Weber and H. Scott Matthews, two Carnegie Mellon researchers.  Every time a Prius or other hybrid owner drives to the grocery store, she may be cancelling out its emissions-reducing benefit, at least if she shops in the meat section. Emission from cows, as well as sheep and other ruminants, are 25 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than the carbon dioxide released by cars and humans.Question 8C, the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines discharged more than 20 million tons of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere, which acted like a layer of sunscreen, reducing the amount of solar radiation and cooling off the earth by an average of one degree F.Question 9C, doctors not taking sanitary precautions.  This was the dawning age of the autopsy, and doctors did not yet know the importance of washing their hands after leaving the autopsy room and entering the delivery room.Question 10C, the psychological effect of the attacks caused people to increase their alcohol consumption, and traffic accidents increased as a result.Scoring32-40: Certified SuperFreak25-31: Freak--surprises lay in wait for you16-24: Wannabe freak--you&#x2019;ve got some reading to do1-15: Conventional wisdomer--you&#x2019;re still thinking in old ways",

This goth-girl is obsessed with vampires and when a new family moves into the old town mansion, she is convinced that the son, Alexander, is a vampire. The story swirls around and through sibling rivalry, peer relationships, friendships, and love. Raven is a feisty protagonist with a quick wit and a real sense of self. She defends herself and her friends, often besting her peers with humor and a quick tongue. As her connection with Alexander deepens, she comes to understand her family better. It is through his shadowy character that readers are kept off balance. Schreiber weaves a tale that is more about acceptance and friendship than about vampire behavior and culture, and sustains a tone that draws readers to the characters rather than to horrific plot developments that would keep them reading. There is far less intensity than in Annette Curtis Klause's Silver Kiss (Laurel-Leaf, 1992) and less moodiness than that found in Amelia Atwater-Rhodes's Midnight Predator (2002) and Shattered Mirror (2001, both Delacorte). While the ending isn't tied up in a neat and pretty bow, it fits the style and tone. All in all, a good read for those who want a vampire love story without the gore.Molly S.

Sugar Beth Carey, \"the wild child of Parrish, Mississippi,\" was once the queen of all she surveyed, but after 15 years and three marriages, she's a broken (and broke) husk of her former self. Who's loving the schadenfreude? The Seawillows, for starters-the gaggle of Southern belles Sugar dumped years ago, plus Winnie Davis, the half-sister she treated like dirt. And there's more: not only did Sugar stomp on gorgeous Ryan Galantine's heart (luckily, Winnie caught him on the rebound), she also got Colin Byrne, the sexy British high school teacher, fired for ostensibly coming on to her. Colin now owns her family's manse, and she's inherited the carriage house on his property-along with a highly valuable painting, location unknown (might it be hiding in Colin's attic? Or is it right under her nose?). Phillips keeps the tension high, with Colin (now a successful writer and member of the town's \"in\" crowd) and all of the rest of Parrish looking to make Sugar pay for past misdeeds. Colin hires her to be his housekeeper, and soon their days are filled with bickering, backstabbing and lots of orgasmic sex. A subplot involving Gigi, Winnie and Ryan's rebellious teenage daughter, who somewhat improbably turns to Sugar Beth for advice, detracts from the primary drama. The novel is at its best when Phillips sticks with what she does best-fast-paced romps featuring two headstrong people who finally realize that they're soul mates.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

InThe Silence of the Lambs, he advises fledgling FBI manhunter Clarice Starling, then makes a bloody, brilliant escape.Years later, posing as scholarly Dr. Fell, curator of a grand family's palazzo, Hannibal lives the good life in Florence, playing lovely tunes by serial killer/composer Henry VIII and killing hardly anyone himself. Clarice is unluckier: in the novel's action-film-like opening scene, she survives an FBI shootout gone wrong, and her nemesis, Paul Krendler, makes her the fall guy. Clarice is suspended, so, unfortunately, the first cop who stumbles on Hannibal is an Italian named Pazzi, who takes after his ancestors, greedy betrayers depicted in Dante'sInferno.Pazzi is on the take from a character as scary as Hannibal: Mason Verger. When Verger was a young man busted for raping children, his vast wealth saved him from jail. All he needed was psychotherapy--with Dr. Lecter. Thanks to the treatment, Verger is now on a respirator, paralyzed except for one crablike hand, watching his enormous, brutal moray eel swim figure eights and devour fish. His obsession is to feed Lecter to some other brutal pets.What happens when the Italian cop gets alone with Hannibal? How does Clarice's reunion with Lecter go from macabre to worse? Suffice it to say that the plot is Harris's weirdest, but it still has his signature mastery of realistic detail. There are flaws: Hannibal's madness gets a motive, which is creepy but lessens his mystery. If you want an exact duplicate ofThe Silence of the Lambs's Clarice/Hannibal duel, you'll miss what's cool about this book--that Hannibal is actually upstaged at points by other monsters. And if you think it's all unprecedentedly horrible, you're right. But note that the horrors are described with exquisite taste. Harris's secret recipe for success is restraint.--Tim Appelo--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",
        "0062083260": "Gr 8 Up-This novel is a cool mixture of Victorian mystery/romance and zombie story. It makes for a sort of steampunk feel. It has suspense and is a mystery in the lightest sense of the word but the fun is in its blending of genres with the cosseted elite mixing with the zombie hordes. Eleanor Fitt is in a troublesome spot. Her brother is missing, her mother refuses to acknowledge the sorry state of their finances and is trying to marry her off to the highest bidder, and the dead are walking. She goes to the Spirit-Hunters determined to find out what really happened to her brother. Instead of answers she finds more questions: Why are the Spirit-Hunters here? Are they causing the trouble with the dead, or are they simply patsies? And, more importantly, why is everyone associated with her brother dying in such a dramatic way? Eleanor is strong willed and inquiring, and the situations mirror the Victorian sensibilities well. Give this novel to anyone who likes a light zombie story with a pinch of romance.-Saleena L.

        "0060760443": "Perfect indulgence for the eponymous set&mdash;or pandering to an anticipated audience? Or maybe both? As the LondonEvening Standardput it, \"The blurb has [the author] down as a simple Surrey housewife who knocked this out between the Hoovering and the hot sex, but further investigation reveals her to be a veteran of book marketing married to the head of Time Warner UK.\" Go figure! Well, either way, this U.K. bestseller is a frothy page-turner that dissects the relationships, desires and discoveries of five English women, all members of a book club. Over the course of a year, the women read 12 novels (includingAtonement,RebeccaandThe Alchemist) and, through their playful but intimate discussions (few of which revolve around the books), they bond closely while coping with such matters as a philandering husband, a mother with dementia, a pregnant but unmarried daughter, an infertility crisis, a wedding and a funeral. It's a testament to Noble's characterizations and plotting that the novel is not overwhelming, despite its numerous (perhaps too many) points of view, complicated backstories and interweaving contemporary crises. Light but never flip, this is funny, contemplative and touching reading, and the group's familiar book choices allow readers to feel as if they're part of the gang, too, as they race to the end, eager to find out what happens, why it does and what it all means.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Next, the brutal beating of Jeannine Phillips, an Animal Control officer, leads the sheriff's department, its staff already stretched thin, to a confrontation with a notorious ranching family and suspected illegal immigrants.

        "0061856436": "Amazon Exclusive: A Letter from Sarah SilvermanDear Reader:My name is Sarah Silverman.  I was once primarily known for saying the word \"poop\" and getting paid above market rates for it.  But those days are over, because I am now going to be known for having written a book.  Why did I write a book, you might wonder?  Because it just seemed like the right time to be getting into the publishing industry.I'm kidding.  Publishing is rotting like an abandoned possum carcass on the shoulder of I-95.  I know that for a fact, because shortly after my book deal was announced, I kept hearing people lament the imminent demise of literature.  These days there is only one reason to write a book:to be taken seriously.  And that is exactly what is about to happen to me.  I'm an author now!  Like Ernest Hemingway and Fyodor Dostoevsky!When I was asked to provide text for an author page, I decided to approach it in a scholarly manner, because that's what authors do.  I looked to other author pages for inspiration, and I learned so much.  For example, while Hemingway and Dostoevsky do not have their own author pages on Amazon.com, Paris Hilton does.  And so does former teenage porn star and multi-tasking fellatrix, Traci Lords.  Hemingway and Dostoevsky might be wondering, quite literally, \"Whom do I have to blow to get my own author page?\"  If someone had a cruel sense of humor, they might respond to Hemingway, \"How about your head off?  Oh wait &ndash; you already DID that!\"  But such a remark would be in bad taste, and as a serious author, I'm above all that.I also learned that Paris' dog, Tinkerbell Hilton, has her own book too.  I read a few pages and found the prose to be overwrought, but you can imagine that, being a dog, she'd be coming from a place of needing to prove something.  By the way, here's a quote from a review of Paris' book that I found on her Amazon.com author page:\"Heiress, socialite, model, actress, singer and media darling Hilton loves her life, knows how to get what she wants and matter-of-factly explains how anyone can be a glamorous, fun-loving, tiara-wearing heiress just like her&hellip; [Paris&rsquo;] advice to 'channel your own inner heiress, create your own image, and project an extreme sense of confidence' is an empowering message for young women.\"This was profoundly inspiring to me.  It made me realize: if young women can read Hilton's book and become heiresses, they can likewise read my book and become anxiety-ridden bedwetters.  And amidst this generation of disposability that favors the digital over the physical, shopping online rather than in stores (oops, this is awkward!), and reading from LCD screens rather than from print on paper, it's nice to know that I will have left a permanent stain by which future generations shall know of my existence.  So readThe Bedwetter, if not for me, then for the children.",

The message ofWho Moved My Cheese?is that all can come to see it as a blessing, if they understand the nature of cheese and the role it plays in their lives.Who Moved My Cheese?is a parable that takes place in a maze. Four beings live in that maze: Sniff and Scurry are mice--nonanalytical and nonjudgmental, they just want cheese and are willing to do whatever it takes to get it. Hem and Haw are \"littlepeople,\" mouse-size humans who have an entirely different relationship with cheese. It's not just sustenance to them; it's their self-image. Their lives and belief systems are built around the cheese they've found. Most of us reading the story will see the cheese as something related to our livelihoods--our jobs, our career paths, the industries we work in--although it can stand for anything, from health to relationships. The point of the story is that we have to be alert to changes in the cheese, and be prepared to go running off in search of new sources of cheese when the cheese we have runs out.Dr.&nbsp;Johnson, coauthor ofThe One Minute Managerand many other books, presents this parable to business, church groups, schools, military organizations--anyplace where you find people who may fear or resist change. And although more analytical and skeptical readers may find the tale a little too simplistic, its beauty is that it sums up all natural history in just 94 pages: Things change.

The author sometimes lapses into mysticism&mdash;In solitude we meet not just ourselves but all other selves&mdash;and his solutions, like the weekend-long Internet Sabbaths he and his wife decreed for their family, are small-bore.

        "B000067DPM": "Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship",

The sheets were stained with blood, and Mara was nowhere to be seen. Dallying with his father&#x2019;s latest bride-to-be on the night before her wedding is scandalous enough, but the possibility that he may have murdered her as well makes Temple a social outcast. Now the &#x201C;Killer&#x201D; Duke of Lamont, Temple has built a new life for himself as the part-owner and muscle behind London&#x2019;s most notorious gambling hell, the Fallen Angel. When Temple hears footsteps following him home late one night, the last person he expects to see when he turns around is a dead woman. Mara ruined his life, but now she offers Temple the redemption he desperately craves, if he will only meet her demands.

In the Republic of Gilead, formerly the United States, far-right Schlafly/Falwell-type ideals have been carried to extremes in the monotheocratic government. The resulting society is a feminist's nightmare: women are strictly controlled, unable to have jobs or money and assigned to various classes: the chaste, childless Wives; the housekeeping Marthas; and the reproductive Handmaids, who turn their offspring over to the \"morally fit\" Wives.

Refreshingly, Coyle (Hardball) displays neither. The journalist moved to Armstrong's training base in Spain to cover the months leading up to the cyclist's sixth Tour de France victory in 2004, and the resulting comfort level of Coyle with his subject is palpable. Armstrong emerges from these pages as neither the cancer-surviving saint his American fans admire, nor the soulless, imperialist machine his European detractors hate. Instead, he comes across as a preternaturally gifted athlete barely removed from the death-defying hellion he was as a teenager, fanatically disciplined, gregarious and generous but with a legendarily icy temper. Coyle sweeps over the basics of Armstrong's Texas childhood and fight with cancer, concentrating on his obsessive training&mdash;this is a sport where results are measured in ounces and microseconds. He's sometimes too loose with his writing, digressing as though he had all the time in the world, but he tightens up for the grand finale: the Tour.

Madcap, touching, laugh-out-loud funny and thoroughly satisfying on all emotional levels, her latest London-set historical focuses on Hyacinth, the eighth sibling in Quinn's bestselling Bridgerton family series (followingWhen He Was Wicked). Too intelligent for her own good and best friends with Lady Danbury, one of society's most outspoken grande dames, Hyacinth is in her fourth season on London's Marriage Mart and again unimpressed by the male selection. Only Lady Danbury's handsome, pockets-to-let grandson Gareth St. Clair can hold his own in a conversation with her and sometimes even leaves her in a speechless, stomach-flipping state. When Hyacinth offers to translate the diary of Gareth's deceased Italian grandmother, the pair find themselves comparing notes, then exchanging kisses and finally burglarizing his estranged father's house at midnight. But the diary also holds secrets that could jeopardize their new love. Practically bouncing with humor, this book will keep readers happily on edge, waiting to see how the final unmarried Bridgerton will fare in Quinn's talented hands.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Still, she could-and, arguably, should-be happier. Thus, her methodical (and bizarre) happiness project: spend one year achieving careful, measurable goals in different areas of life (marriage, work, parenting, self-fulfillment) and build on them cumulatively, using concrete steps (such as, in January, going to bed earlier, exercising better, getting organized, and \"acting more energetic\"). By December, she's striving bemusedly to keep increasing happiness in every aspect of her life. The outcome is good, not perfect (in accordance with one of her \"Secrets of Adulthood\": \"Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good\"), but Rubin's funny, perceptive account is both inspirational and forgiving, and sprinkled with just enough wise tips, concrete advice and timely research (including all those other recent books on happiness) to qualify as self-help.

He laughs easily, he likes people, he loves school, he tries to rescue lost  girls in blizzards, he talks to old ladies. The only problem is, he's a loser.  Until fourth grade, Zinkoff's uncontrollable giggling in class, sloppy  handwriting, horrible flute playing, bad grades, clumsiness, and ineptitude at  sports go largely unnoticed. When he blows a race for his team, however, his  transition to loserdom is complete: \"[Loser] is the word. It is Zinkoff's new  name. It is not in the roll book.\" Fortunately, he doesn't really notice. As he  did inStargirl, Newbery  Medal-winning author Jerry Spinelli again explores the cruelty of a student body  and how it does and doesn't affect one student, pure of spirit. Presumably ifLosermakes one child view a \"different kid\" as a three-dimensional  character, Spinelli will consider his book successful.The author recounts Zinkoff's story--a case study of sorts--in short sentences  from a deliberately reportorial point of view, documenting the first years of  the boy's life and his evolution into a loser. What makes the book charming and  buoyant is that the reader, like Zinkoff's parents and his favorite teacher,  appreciates the boy's oblivious joie de vivre and his divine quirks. What is  less compelling about the novel is the \"let this be a lesson to us\"  heavy-handedness that accompanies the reportorial approach. Still, Spinelli  comes through again with a lively, often moving story with humor and heart to  spare.

        "0061988243": "[Signature]Reviewed byMarlon JamesOf the many pitfalls lurking for the historical novel, the most dangerous is history itself. The best writers either warp it for selfish purposes (Gore Vidal), dig for the untold, interior history (Toni Morrison), or both (Jeannette Winterson). Allende, four years afterInes of My Soul, returns with another historical novel, one that soaks up so much past life that there is nowhere left to go but where countless have been. Opening in Saint Domingue a few years before the Haitian revolution would tear it apart, the story has at its center Zarit&eacute;, a mulatto whose extraordinary life takes her from that blood-soaked island to dangerous and freewheeling New Orleans; from rural slave life to urban Creole life and a different kind of cruelty and adventure. Yet even in the new city, Zarit&eacute; can't quite free herself from the island, and the people alive and dead that have followed her.Zarit&eacute;'s passages are striking. More than merely lyrical, they map around rhythms and spirits, making her as much conduit as storyteller. One wishes there was more of her because, unlike Allende, Zarit&eacute; is under no mission to show us how much she knows. Every instance, a brush with a faith healer, for example, is an opportunity for Allende to showcase what she has learned about voodoo, medicine, European and Caribbean history, Napoleon, the Jamaican slave Boukman, and the legendary Mackandal, a runaway slave and master of black magic who has appeared in several novels including Alejo Carpentier'sKingdom of This World. The effect of such display of research is a novel that is as inert as a history textbook, much like, oddly enough John Updike'sTerrorist, a novel that revealed an author who studied a voluminous amount of facts without learning a single truth.Slavery as a subject in fiction is still a high-wire act, but one expects more from Allende. Too often she forgoes the restraint and empathy essential for such a topic and plunges into a heavy breathing prose reminiscent of the Falconhurst novels of the 1970s, but without the guilty pleasure of sexual taboo. Sex, overwritten and undercooked, is where opulent hips slithered like a knowing snake until she impaled herself upon his rock-hard member with a deep sigh of joy. Even the references to African spirituality seem skin-deep and perfunctory, revealing yet another writer too entranced by the myth of black cultural primitivism to see the brainpower behind it. WithInes of My Soulone had the sense that the author was trying to structure a story around facts, dates, incidents, and real people. Here it is the reverse, resulting in a book one second-guesses at every turn. Of course there will be a forbidden love. Betrayal. Incest. Heartbreak. Insanity. Violence. And in the end the island in the novel's title remains legend. Fittingly so, because to reach theIsland Beneath the Sea, one would have had to dive deep. Allende barely skims the surface.Marlon James's recent novel, The Book of Night Womenwas a finalist for the 2010 National Book Critics Circle Award.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0062024035": "A Q&amp;A with Author Veronica RothQ:What advice would you offer to young aspiring writers, who long to live a success story like your own?Roth:One piece of advice I have is: Want something else more than success. Success is a lovely thing, but your desire to say something, your worth, and your identity shouldn&rsquo;t rely on it, because it&rsquo;s not guaranteed and it&rsquo;s not permanent and it&rsquo;s not sufficient. So work hard, fall in love with the writing&mdash;the characters, the story, the words, the themes&mdash;and make sure that you are who you are regardless of your life circumstances. That way, when the good things come, they don&rsquo;t warp you, and when the bad things hit you, you don&rsquo;t fall apart.Q:You&rsquo;re a young author--is it your current adult perspective or not-so-recent teenage perspective that brought about the factions in the development of this story? Do you think that teens or adults are more likely to fit into categories in our current society?Roth:Other aspects of my identity have more to do with the factions than my age. The faction system reflects my beliefs about human nature&mdash;that we can make even something as well-intentioned as virtue into an idol, or an evil thing. And that virtue as an end unto itself is worthless to us. I did spend a large portion of my adolescence trying to be as &ldquo;good&rdquo; as possible so that I could prove my worth to the people around me, to myself, to God, to everyone. It&rsquo;s only now that I&rsquo;m a little older that I realize I am unable to be truly &ldquo;good&rdquo; and that it&rsquo;s my reasons for striving after virtue that need adjustment more than my behavior. In a sense,Divergentis me writing through that realization&mdash;everyone in Beatrice&rsquo;s society believes that virtue is the end, the answer. I think that&rsquo;s a little twisted.I think we all secretly love and hate categories&mdash;love to get a firm hold on our identities, but hate to be confined&mdash;and I never loved and hated them more than when I was a teenager. That said: Though we hear a lot about high school cliques, I believe that adults categorize each other just as often, just in subtler ways. It is a dangerous tendency of ours. And it begins in adolescence.Q:If you could add one more faction to the world withinDivergent, what would it be?Roth:I tried to construct the factions so that they spanned a wide range of virtues. Abnegation, for example, includes five of the traditional &ldquo;seven heavenly virtues:&rdquo; chastity, temperance, charity, patience, and humility. That said, it would be interesting to have a faction centered on industriousness, in which diligence and hard work are valued most, and laziness is not allowed. They would be in constant motion, and would probably be happy to take over for the factionless. And hard-working people can certainly take their work too far, as all the factions do with their respective virtues. I&rsquo;m not sure what they would wear, though. Overalls, probably.Q:What do you think are the advantages, if any, to the society you&rsquo;ve created inDivergent?Roth:All the advantages I see only seem like advantages to me because I live in our current society. For example, the members of their society don&rsquo;t focus on certain things: race, religion, sexual orientation, political affiliation, etc. I mean, a world in which you look different from the majority and no one minds? That sounds good to me. But when I think about it more, I realize that they&rsquo;re doing the exact same thing we do, but with different criteria by which to distinguish ourselves from others. Instead of your skin color, it&rsquo;s the color of your shirt that people assess, or the results of your aptitude test. Same problem, different system.Q:What book are you currently reading and how has it changed you, if at all?Roth:I recently finishedImaginary Girlsby Nova Ren Suma, which I would call &ldquo;contemporary with a paranormal twist,&rdquo; or something to that effect. It&rsquo;s about a girl whose sister has a powerful kind of magnetism within the confines of a particular town, and how their love for each other breaks some things apart and puts other things back together. It was refreshing to read a young adult book that is about sisterhood instead of romance. It&rsquo;s one of those books that makes you love a character and then hate a character and then love them again&mdash;that shows you that people aren&rsquo;t all good or all bad, but somewhere in between.Imaginary Girlsgave me a lot to think about, and the writing was lovely, which I always love to see.--This text refers to theHardcoveredition.",

The Olympic dreams of teenaged equestrian Annemarie Zimmer end when her beloved horse, Harry, injures her and destroys himself in a jumping accident. In the agonizing aftermath, she gives up riding and horses entirely. Two decades later, she returns to her family's horse farm a divorcee, with her troubled teenaged daughter, Eve, in tow. There, her gruff Germanic mother struggles to maintain the farm and care for Annemarie's father, who is stricken with ALS. Although Annemarie decides (disastrously) to manage the farm's business, her attention quickly turns to an old and ostensibly worthless horse with the same rare coloring as Harry. Her long-denied passion for riding reawakens as she tracks the horse's identity and eventually discovers it to be Harry's younger brother. She must heal both horse and herself as she struggles with her father's deterioration, Eve's rebellion and her attraction to both the farm's new trainer and her childhood sweetheart Dan. Impulsive and self-absorbed, Annemarie isn't always likable, but Gruen's portrait of the stoic elder Zimmers is beautifully nuanced, as is her evocation of Eve's adolescent troubles. Amid this realistically complex generational sandwich, the book's appealing horse scenes&#x97;depicted with unsentimental affection&#x97;help build a moving story of loss, survival and renewal.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0060195339": "Sportswriter Leavy describes her book as not so much a biography of a ballplayer as a social history of baseball, with the former star pitcher's career as the barometer of change. While both a preface and an introduction spin Leavy's storytelling wheels, a compelling, literary social history does indeed get rolling. Koufax refused to participate in the project, so Leavy has spoken to hundreds of people with something to share on the former Brooklyn/L.A. Dodger Hank Aaron, Joe Torre, childhood friend and Mets co-owner Fred Wilpon and even the old Dodgers equipment manager among them and their testimonies make for a rich baseball pastiche and an engaging look at the game's more innocent period. Koufax capped off his first year by watching the 1955 World Series against the hated Yankees from the bench, and following the Dodgers' historic victory headed from Yankee Stadium to class at Columbia University, where he studied architecture (in case the baseball thing didn't work out). Even when Leavy's historical anecdotes are quaint, they prove timely: she details Koufax holding out for a better contract with fellow star pitcher Don Drysdale in '66, paving the way for free agency. While Leavy's interest in Koufax's Jewish heritage at times seems to border on the obsessive, she delivers an honest and exquisitely detailed examination of a complex man, one whose skills were such that slugger Willie Stargell once likened hitting against Koufax to \"trying to drink coffee with a fork.\"Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.",

Their misfortunes begin one gray day on Briny Beach when Mr. Poe tells them that their parents perished in a fire that destroyed their whole house. \"It is useless for me to describe to you how terrible Violet, Klaus, and even Sunny felt in the time that followed,\" laments the personable (occasionally pedantic) narrator, who tells the story as if his readers are gathered around an armchair on pillows. But of course what follows is dreadful. The children thought it was bad when the well-meaning Poes bought them grotesque-colored clothing that itched. But when they are ushered to the dilapidated doorstep of the miserable, thin, unshaven, shiny-eyed, money-grubbing Count Olaf, they know that they--and their family fortune--are in real trouble. Still, they could never have anticipated how much trouble. While it's true that the events that unfold in Lemony Snicket's novels are bleak, and things never turn out as you'd hope, these delightful, funny, linguistically playful books are reminiscent of Roald Dahl (rememberJames and the Giant Peachand his horrid spinster aunts), Charles Dickens (the orphaned Pip inGreat Expectationswithout the mysterious benefactor), and Edward Gorey (The Gashlycrumb Tinies).

Tiberium, the mysterious, alien crystalline structure that infested Earth for decades and caused years of relentless conflict between the Global Defense Initiative and the Brotherhood of Nod, was close to rendering the planet uninhabitable. In the midst of this crisis, Kane, Nod's prophetic leader, emerged from seclusion to deliver GDI the message that he had developed a system that could control Tiberium and harness its power. But he could not build this \"Tiberium Control Network\" without GDI's cooperation. Thus, the two opposing factions&mdash;GDI and Nod&mdash;found themselves in a desperate and unlikely alliance to stop Tiberium from extinguishing mankind.Now, after 15 years, the network is nearly complete. Tiberium is under strict control and the revitalized Earth is on the cusp of a new age of prosperity and progress. It is only now that the world's citizens begin to seriously ponder why Kane chose to help, and what he will want in return. Kane. GDI. Nod. Tiberium. How will it end? These questions and more lead to the dramatic final act of the 15-year Tiberium saga inCommand &amp; Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight.GameplayCommand &amp; Conqueris a real-time strategy gaming franchise, andCommand &amp; Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilightis no exception. Players assume color-coated versions of the GDI or Nod factions and uncover segments of the map, where they must manage Tiberium and other resources in their possession or that they they mine or commandeer in the field. Other factions occur in the game, but are not playable, and different single player campaigns are available to players depending on which of the two factions are chosen. The energy that Tiberium crystals possess is used in the manufacture and upgrading of mining and combat units, weapons and support infrastructure in preparation for impending conflicts with other players on the same map that are doing the same. Each faction has its own distinct unit types, both land and air based, which although unique, are overall more or less balanced against those of opposing faction. In addition, certain units can be captured on the battlefield and used to supplement your arsenal. The overarching task though is to combine the right number and type of units with the right battlefield strategy for the conflict and terrain at hand.Historically,C&amp;Cmatches have been won by completely eliminating all enemy units that stand against you. Although there is certainly plenty of this withinTiberian Twilight, the game also is different in that players need not eliminate all enemy units, instead capturing control nodes throughout the game and holding them for a minimum amount of time. Doing so leads to earning enough points to win the match.Tiberian Twilightalso differs from earlier games in the series with the addition of certain RPG game elements. Players overall orientation within their chosen faction is class based, with units falling generally in offensive, defensive or support classes depending on your play style. These units can be upgraded with experience points, which are gained through success against enemy units, with more advanced enemy units earning the conquering player more points, and thus potential unit upgrade opportunity.5-on-5 Online MultiplayerCommand &amp; Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilightallows PC gamers to team up and battle like never before.

It sounds easier than  the previous cinematic attempts by theGhostbustersand theCatholic Church, but it's not.  The complications and cleverness of the game manifest in the use of light and  shadow.

The narrative then travels back several weeks, tracing the relationships and events that have led to the somber assembly. This tangled web includes not one but two sets of star-crossed lovers; an upstairs/downstairs romance; a scheming social climber; a bitter servant girl; and oodles of money, all set in a Edith Wharton via Hollywood vision of Old New York. The dialogue has its clunky moments, and the plot twist that drives the tale is telegraphed from the very start, but readers caught up in the fancy dress intrigue are unlikely to mind much: it&#x92;s all part of the dishy fun. Needless to say, the ending paves the way for at least one sequel. Ages 14-up. (Dec.)",

Failing to obtain work  at Lord &amp; Taylor, the pair, self-described as long-limbed, blue-eyed  blondes, were hired at Tiffany's&mdash;the first female floor sales pages,  delivering packages to the repair and shipping department, for $20 a week.

        "0060936231": "As one of Gao Xingjian's characters remarks, if a fiction writer could know the true stories of the people he passes on the street, he would be amazed. Surely the Nobel laureate's own story, which forms the basis ofSoul Mountain, is worthy of amazement. In 1983 Gao was diagnosed with lung cancer, the disease that had killed his father. At the same time, he had been threatened with arrest for his counterrevolutionary writings and was preparing to flee Beijing for the remote regions of southwest China. Shortly before his departure, however, the condemned man got at least a partial reprieve: a second set of x-rays revealed no cancer at all. On the heels of this extraordinary redemption, he began the circuitous journey that would lead him to the sacred (and possibly mythical) mountain of  Lingshan--and to this daring, historically resonant novel.A destination chosen arbitrarily, at the suggestion of a fellow traveler, the elusive Lingshan becomes rich with meaning for the narrator ofSoul Mountain. Meanwhile, the narrator himself shows a tendency to go forth and multiply. First he divides into You and I. Then You generates yet a third voice, a somewhat simple but intense young woman named She, followed by He--and none of these personae can resist the elemental lure of the sacred site. Indeed, the search for Lingshan becomes a metaphor for all spiritual striving:Would it be better to go along the main road? It will take longer travelling by the main road? After making some detours you will understand in your heart? Once you understand in your heart you will find it as soon as you look for it?  The important thing is to be sincere of heart?  If your heart is sincere then your wish will be granted?Along the way, I and You mourn the devastations of the Cultural Revolution, when thousands of monuments, temples, and graves were reduced to rubble. The obliteration of these reminders of the dead becomes a torment to the narrators of the novel, who struggle to assert their individuality--itself a proscribed act in Communist  China--against what they see as a false and brutal ideal that has swept away history, literature, and tradition as decisively as it has destroyed the ancient forests. (At one point Gao describes the sad spectacle of the few remaining pandas, who wander a shrinking woodland wearing electronic transmitters.) Seamlessly translated by the Australian scholar Mabel Lee,Soul Mountainis a masterpiece of self-observation set against a soulful denunciation of \"progress\" and practicality.--Regina Marler--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",
        "0060931418": "At the height of the Harlem Renaissance during the 1930s, Zora Neale Hurston was the preeminent black woman writer in the United States. She was a sometime-collaborator withLangston Hughesand a fierce rival ofRichard Wright. Her stories appeared in major magazines, she consulted on Hollywood screenplays, and she penned four novels, an autobiography, countless essays, and two books on black mythology. Yet by the late 1950s, Hurston was living in obscurity, working as a maid in a Florida hotel. She died in 1960 in a Welfare home, was buried in an unmarked grave, and quickly faded from literary consciousness until 1975 whenAlice Walkeralmost single-handedly revived interest in her work.Of Hurston's fiction,Their Eyes Were Watching Godis arguably the best-known and perhaps the most controversial. The novel follows the fortunes of Janie Crawford, a woman living in the black town of Eaton, Florida. Hurston sets up her characters and her locale in the first chapter, which, along with the last, acts as a framing device for the story of Janie's life. Unlike Wright andRalph Ellison, Hurston does not write explicitly about black people in the context of a white world--a fact that earned her scathing criticism from the social realists--but she doesn't ignore the impact of black-white relations either:It was the time for sitting on porches beside the road. It was the time to hear things and talk. These sitters had been tongueless, earless, eyeless conveniences all day long. Mules and other brutes had occupied their skins. But now, the sun and the bossman were gone, so the skins felt powerful and human. They became lords of sounds and lesser things. They passed nations through their mouths. They sat in judgment.One person the citizens of Eaton are inclined to judge is Janie Crawford, who has married three men and been tried for the murder of one of them. Janie feels no compulsion to justify herself to the town, but shedoesexplain herself to her friend, Phoeby, with the implicit understanding that Phoeby can \"tell 'em what Ah say if you wants to. Dat's just de same as me 'cause mah tongue is in mah friend's mouf.\"Hurston's use of dialect enraged other African American writers such as Wright, who accused her of pandering to white readers by giving them the black stereotypes they expected. Decades later, however, outrage has been replaced by admiration for her depictions of black life, and especially the lives of black women. InTheir Eyes Were Watching GodZora Neale Hurston breathes humanity into both her men and women, and allows them to speak in their own voices.--Alix Wilber",

You come down here and pretend to be on the lam.\" Those on the gleefully maniacal Serge's trail include a conniving lawyer gulled into thinking Serge has the key to Al Capone's lost treasure, a Florida Department of Law Enforcement task force, and Serge's personal Javert, the obsessive, dubiously lucid but insightful Agent Mahoney. Dorsey cheerfully rejoices in Florida's colorful history and in the triumph of absurdity and anarchy over law and propriety. His police are no better than Keystone Kops, while tempering his deranged protagonist's taste for complex murder is Serge's unerring ability to select worthy targets.

Logically, Uhtred should now ally himself with Alfred, whose Wessex kingdom alone has successfully resisted Danish control. But Uhtred sees a better chance of recovering his lost estate if he finds a way to join the Danes, who raised him and whose simple life of \"ale, women, sword, and reputation\" he finds more congenial than Alfred's Christian piety and military caution. But when the Danes invade Wessex, Uhtred's loyalties are further divided. His Celtic mistress foretells victory for Alfred, but Uhtred can scarcely believe that the bedraggled king, camped in isolated marshes with a handful of supporters, can repel the invaders and unite England. Yet pride grows in Uhtred: \"I understood that among the Danes I was as important as my friends, and without friends I was just another landless, masterless warrior. But among the Saxons I was another Saxon, and among the Saxons I did not need another man's generosity.\" Uhtred demonstrates his newfound patriotism in the book's climactic battle at Edington.

From that uncomfortable realization came his popular Physique Transformation Contest (top prize that first year: Phillips's own Lamborghini), now world famous, and this book.The three-times-a-week weightlifting program inBody for Lifeis deceptively simple. If you've spent any time in the gym, you've already done all the exercises. But Phillips includes a couple of high-intensity sets at the end of each exercise that should compound the training effect on each muscle group. Same goes for the cardiovascular exercise he recommends: just 20 minutes, three times a week. But those 20 minutes are spent jacking the intensity up and down, accomplishing more in less time.Phillips arranges all this into a 12-week program, along with nutritional and motivational tips. Be warned that the nutritional advice gets a little spacey. For example, he puts \"carbohydrates\" and \"vegetables\" into separate categories, and recommends three daily doses of a nutritional supplement called Myoplex, which his company manufactures. (Fortunately, he gives tips on how to make each dose taste different, such as by adding drops of peppermint extract.)

I soon realized that each writer has weird tricks and idiosyncratic methods.  Some wrote late at night, in the tranquil bubble of solitude created by a sleeping world, while others preferred first morning light.  Some cranked out three pages a day, workmanlike, whereas others worked in extended bursts followed by catatonic exhaustion.  Some preferred the monastic discipline of facing cinder-block walls, while others preferred soaring views.I quickly learned that I had to discover my own methods.  Most useful, I realized that I have different brains at different times of day.  In the morning, I have a creative brain; in the evening, I have a critical brain.  If I try to edit in the morning, I&rsquo;m too creative, and if I try to create in the evening, I&rsquo;m too critical.  So, I go at writing like a two piston machine: create in the morning, edit in the evening, create in the morning, edit in the evening&hellip;Yet all writers seem to agree on one point: writing well is desperately difficult, and it never gets easier.  It&rsquo;s like running: if you push your limits, you can become a faster runner, but you will always suffer.  In nonfiction, writing is thinking; if I can&rsquo;t make the words work, that means I don&rsquo;t know yet what I think.  Sometimes after toiling in a quagmire for dozens (or hundreds) of hours I throw the whole effort into the wastebasket and start with a blank page.  When I sheepishly shared this wastebasket strategy with the great management writer Peter Drucker, he made me feel much better when he exclaimed, &ldquo;Ah, that is immense progress!&rdquo;The final months of completingGreat by Choicerequired seven days a week effort, with numerous all-nighters.  I had naively hoped after writingGood to Greatthat perhaps I had learned enough about writing that this work might not require descending deep into the dark cave of despair.  Alas, the cave of darkness is the only path to producing the best work; there is no easy path, no shorter path, no path of less suffering.  Winston Churchill once said that writing a book goes through five phases.  In phase one, it is a novelty or a toy; by phase five, it is a tyrant ruling your life, and just as you are about to be reconciled to your servitude, you kill the monster and fling him to the public.  And so, exiting the caving blinking in the sunlight, we&rsquo;ve killed the monster and hereby fling.  We love this book, and have great passion about sharing it with the world&mdash;making all the suffering worthwhile.A Q&amp;A with Morten T. HansenQ:How did you and Jim develop ideas together during the research?Hansen:During our hundreds of research meetings&mdash;what we called &ldquo;chimposiums&rdquo; (as when two curious chimps get together), Jim and I probed the data, exchanged views, and debated vigorously. We didn't always agree, in which case we did some more analysis to get to the main findings we report in Great by Choice.Q:Why didGreat by Choicetake nine years of effort?Hansen:When Jim and I started out some nine years ago, we did not anticipate that it would take us this long, nor did we know what the results would be.  We followed a simple principle&mdash;carry out the absolutely best research we could possibly do, no matter how long.Q:Did you find what you expected, or surprises?Hansen:The way we did the research was to explore why some companies attained great performance over the long-run while others did not. We did not start with any preconceived ideas and hypotheses about what made the difference. We let the data speak. What we found, and what we report in the book, surprised us a great deal. A few times we scratched our heads because we were so surprised, but that's what the data revealed.Q:Did you have fun?Hansen:Analyzing the data, debating, and arriving at some really interesting insights was a great deal of fun. It created joy in my life. It may not be everyone's idea of having a good time, but Jim and I always looked forward to our chimposiums.  I hope you will enjoyGreat by Choiceas much as Jim and I enjoyed the research process!",

        "B00006IR62": "Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship",

With wireless internet, video and digital music playback, and incredible data storage and connectivity options, the Sony PSP--or PlayStation Portable--is a complete solution for the mobile digital lifestyle. Sony has hit the mark by combining both horsepower and groundbreaking features into a package that weighs just a hair more than half a pound.DesignThe PSP's exceptional performance comes from a 333 MHz processor that dwarfs the speed of competing handheld consoles. Add this polygon-pushing muscle to 4 MB of fast DRAM and 32 MB of embedded RAM, and you've got a device with graphics rendering capabilities close to that of the PlayStation2. And because no game is complete without audio, the PSP is generously appointed with built-in stereo speakers, as well Dolby Digital 7.1 surround sound capability. Sony has also pulled out all the stops with the PSP display. The bright, 4.3-inch LCD sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution--plenty of real estate for heavy gaming action and widescreen-format movies. All of this is powered by a removable, and rechargeable, lithium-ion battery.Screen machine: The 4.3-inch display sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution. Movies and games on the go have never been more gorgeous.From a controls perspective, the PSP is made for gaming. If you're familiar with a PlayStation controller, you'll be a pro at the PSP's controls in no time. Directional buttons, as well as an analog stick are provided. Meanwhile, the familiar left and right shoulder buttons, as well as triangle, circle, cross and square buttons are integrated into the device's slim case. Finally, home, select, and start buttons give you quick access and control over the PSP's important functions.To have and to hold: The PSP's easy-to-master controls are cleverly integrated into the device's slim profile.Supported MediaAt the heart of the PSP is a new, proprietary media format known as the Universal Media Disc, or UMD. Each UMD can hold 1.8 GB of data, enough room for rich and complex games. UMDs, which are housed in a protective cover, slide into the rear of the PSP. Sony has declared the UMD an open format for developers and media content owners, so movies, music and other media are on the horizon from third parties. Sony has also signed on many popular game developers for the platform, so a deep library of titles is on tap.While the UMD is great for read-only media such as games and movies, Sony solves the problem of data storage with the addition of a Memory Stick Duo slot. With Memory Stick Duo media, you can store your saved games, downloaded online content, personal video and audio files, and more. When you want access to these files from your PC, simply use the PSP's USB 2.0 port to turn the device into a fast portable media drive. Then, drag and drop files such as your photos, MP3s, and videos onto the PSP, just as you would any other removable storage device. The PSP ships with a 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, and additional media with higher storage capacities are available.Major media: Sony's PSP-compatible Universal Media Disc (UMD) can hold 1.8 GB of data.ConnectivityThe PSP blows away the competition in the connectivity department. Indeed, the PSP's ability to connect to the internet, and to other PSPs and USB-based peripherals, is a real advantage. At the top of the list is Wifi connectivity, or IEEE 801.11b. Use this wireless internet standard to connect to other gamers around the world for hot multiplayer action--all from your couch, or your local Wifi hotspot. As mentioned, the PSP's USB 2.0 port is great for PC connectivity, but it also opens the PSP up for a whole range of future peripherals. Sony has plans for the PSP in other ways, too; the unit's infrared port speaks of remote control capabilities in the near future.A Digital CompanionIf you haven't already guessed, Sony has positioned the PSP to be much more than a gaming device. Out of the box, the device is ready to serve as a portable video player and photo viewer. By using the new H.264 MPEG-4 video standard, Sony obviously has its eyes on making the PSP a robust video device with support for feature length movies and more. In addition, the PSP offers a great way to transport and share your photos in JPEG format. And let's not forget the music. Load up your favorite MP3-encoded songs onto a Memory Stick Duo and you've got a portable audio powerhouse. The device also supports Sony's ATRAC audio codec, so you can play songs acquired from Sony's Connect Online Music Store. Sony even ships a nifty pair of earbuds--complete with an inline remote control-- with the PSP.What's in the BoxPSP device, AC adapter, battery pack, 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, earbud headphones with remote control, soft case and hand strap.",
        "0061671339": "Chesley-winning illustrator Brom (The Plucker) weaves together gloomy prose and horrifying adventures in this macabre fairy tale inspired by J.M. Barrie'sPeter Pan. Born of faerie blood, Peter hunts abandoned children, runaways and the hopeless, recruiting for his Devils in Avalon and promising them a place where you never have to grow up. He conveniently fails to mention that Avalon's monsters are very real, and the Devils must practice their war games or risk being tortured to death, eaten or worse. While early chapters are promising, this gothic fantasy stumbles on its own darkness. The devilishly amusing flashbacks to Peter's origins don't make up for the heavy-handed bloodshed, rampant violence and two-dimensional characters. It's all fiendish monsters and desperate battles in this twisted, dark Neverland; the Disney Peter's mirth and good humor are nowhere to be found.(Sept.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

And then things get really weird.You see, on every map of Portland, Oregon, there is a big splotch of green on the edge of the city labeled &ldquo;I.W.&rdquo; This stands for &ldquo;Impassable Wilderness.&rdquo; No one&rsquo;s ever gone in&mdash;or at least returned to tell of it.And this is where the crows take her brother.So begins an adventure that will take Prue and her friend Curtis deep into the Impassable Wilderness. There they uncover a secret world in the midst of violent upheaval, a world full of warring creatures, peaceable mystics, and powerful figures with the darkest intentions. And what begins as a rescue mission becomes something much bigger as the two friends find themselves entwined in a struggle for the very freedom of this wilderness.A wilderness the locals call Wildwood.Wildwoodis a spellbinding tale full of wonder, danger, and magic that juxtaposes the thrill of a secret world and modern city life. Original and fresh yet steeped in classic fantasy, this is a novel that could have only come from the imagination of Colin Meloy, celebrated for his inventive and fantastic storytelling as the lead singer of the Decemberists. With dozens of intricate and beautiful illustrations by award-winning artist Carson Ellis,Wildwoodis truly a new classic for the twenty-first century.AWildwoodPlaylist by Colin Meloy &amp; Carson Ellis\"Ramble On\"by Led ZeppelinColin Meloy: I remember reading an interview with Evan Dando from the Lemonheads right around the time the first Lord of the Rings movie came out, bemoaning the fact that the director hadn&rsquo;t included asingleZeppelin song in the movie. I tend to agree; I mean, how rad would it&rsquo;ve been after that dramatic ending inThe Return of the King, with all its royal celebrations and slo-mo montages&mdash;the screen goes black and those monster riffs of &ldquo;Immigrant Song&rdquo; kick in? Mind-blowing. So much incredible music in the 60s and 70s was directly fueled by mid-century fantasy fiction, something thatWildwoodowes much to; I feel it would be deeply remiss here not to include a little Zepp.\"Marching Song\"by Esben and the WitchColin Meloy: That said, when I was deep in my preadolescent reverie of fantasy and sci-fi, my friends and I would meet every weekend at someone&rsquo;s house to play Dungeons &amp; Dragons. There. Confession made. And as everyone knows, the best Dungeon Masters always partnered up their biggest action scenarios with music. While I think it may have been de rigueur to blast Zeppelin or Hawkwind for some folks, I considered myself to be somewhat of a sophisticate. Joy Division was perfect music for a slow, suspenseful crawl through a gelatinous cube-infested grotto. The Legendary Pink Dots added an extra dimension to a party&rsquo;s first encounter with some weird, reclusive nemesis in a castle tower. An Enchantress might appear to &ldquo;Under Ice&rdquo; by Kate Bush or anything from Siouxsie&rsquo;s output. When I first heard this song from Brighton, England&rsquo;s Esben and the Witch (even the name is evocative of those days) I imagined a new generation of over-imaginative ten-year-olds pairing their fantastical ramblings with the drowning rains and empty plains of this song.\"Take It Easy\"by Hopeton LewisColin Meloy: Switching gears, here. Rocksteady, a kind of precursor to the reggae explosion of the 70s, was a beautiful, thoughtful, random amalgam of classic R&amp;B and traditional Jamaican rhythms. It&rsquo;s clearly the kind of music that is birthed out of necessity; a bunch of poor kids in the slums of Kingston figuring out for themselves how to re-create the sounds that they were hearing over crappy radio speakers: Sam Cooke, Ben E. King, and Sam &amp; Dave. And what came out wasn&rsquo;tquitethe same, but beautiful and weird and extraordinary in its own right. All this to say: I think that rocksteady music is the music of true enjoyment, the aural equivalent of a slice of bacon, and a rocksteady party was the kind of party I imagined Prue&rsquo;s parents would throw to celebrate Mac and Prue&rsquo;s joyful return. And I&rsquo;ll bet that Prue&rsquo;s dad dug deep for some Lewis sides&mdash;maybe he even had them on 45.\"Tam Lin\"by Fairport ConventionColin Meloy:  My 60s Brit Folk obsession is fairly well documented, but I thought I&rsquo;d be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t include an old folk song in this list. This one, in particular, features a forbidding forest and an evil fairy queen and a pair of star-crossed lovers. Clocking in just north of seven minutes, it&rsquo;s as immersive and complete a narrative as a song can hope to retell.\"Jar of Hearts\"by Christina PerriCarson Ellis: I love Sibylle Baier&rsquo;s mournful songs and I listened to them a lot when I was working onWildwood, especially during the rainy months. Portland winters can be dreary and sometimes gloomy music is the best thing for them. This isn&rsquo;t my very favorite song of hers, but I chose it because, you know, the title.\"I Lost Something in the Hills\"by Sibylle BaierCarson Ellis: The intensity and focused passion of this song makes me think of my darling Jack, along with the references to heaven and hell, a favorite theme of his.\"My Lovely Elizabeth\"by S.E. RogieCarson Ellis: Wildwood has a lot of illustrations&mdash;85 in all&mdash;and it was hard work getting them done. Man, I love to draw but at times this project was exhausting. At times it was downright grueling. Fortunately, I have some remedies for this: taking a walk always helps, as does yoga, as does S. E. Rogie.\"Katie Cruel\"by Karen DaltonCarson Ellis: This is a spooky traditional song that dates back to the Revolutionary War. LikeWildwood&rsquo;s villainess, Alexandra, Katie Cruel roams the forest and the &ldquo;bogs and mire,&rdquo; jilted and in exile. This is a good song to listen to while walking in Forest Park, the real woods that were the inspiration forWildwood&rsquo;s Impassable Wilderness. Or while walking in any misty, quiet forest where beards of moss hang from the gnarled branches of dead trees and there&rsquo;s little sign of civilization. You can imagine that around any bend you might find the solitary hut of Katie Cruel, a little curl of smoke drifting up from its chimney and the sound of her high lonesome banjo coming from within. I also love this song&rsquo;s beautiful, totally unhinged chorus:Oh that I was where I would be,Then I would be where I am not,Here I am where I must beGo where I would, I cannot.\"Over the Hills and Far Away\"by Led ZeppelinCarson Ellis: I&rsquo;m a longtime Led Zeppelin fan and this song, in addition to having a fitting title, was another one I loved when I was Prue&rsquo;s age. I first heard it around the time I read The Hobbit, and I thought its medieval vagabond vibe was awesome. I&rsquo;m also a sucker for a song that starts with a pretty guitar part and then gets crazy. As an adult I tend to like Zeppelin&rsquo;s earlier, bluesier stuff better but, as a kid, I loved the Middle Earth-ish stuff and &ldquo;Over the Hills and Far Away&rdquo; was my jam.A Look InsideWildwoodClick on the images below to open larger versions.

Jack Newlin, a wealthy attorney with one of the most influential law firms in Philadelphia, killed his wife in a moment of drunken passion, stabbing her repeatedly when she announced she wanted a divorce. Or at least that is what he is claiming to the police.The fact is, Jack is framing himself because he fears his wife's murder was his daughter's crime of passion. Sixteen-year-old Paige Newlin is a successful model whose relationship with her manager-mother had been famously rocky. To make sure that he's convicted, Jack hires rookie lawyer Mary DiNunzio to defend him. But Mary doesn't buy Jack's story, and neither does the senior detective on the case. In a fascinating turn on the usual courtroom tale, then, Jack struggles to maintain his false story of guilt while his lawyer and the police struggle to prove him innocent. Meanwhile, Mary wrestles with both her uncertainty as a lawyer and with her attraction for her client.Lisa Scottoline, often identified as the \"female John Grisham,\" has led the pack of female authors in the legal thriller genre, winning an Edgar for her second novel,Final Appeal.Moment of Truthdoes have moments that don't, in fact, ring true. Why is Jack Newlin so quick to forgive his daughter when he thinks she's killed her own mother? And if he's so concerned with her welfare, why did he absent himself from her upbringing? But it's nonetheless interesting for its innovative plot conceit and its examination of high-profile murder trials. If one is able to overlook the problems with Newlin's motivation, the story Scottoline weaves is a compelling one, and her heroine, Mary, is an enjoyable, self-doubting twist on the super-lawyer at the center of most legal thrillers.--Patrick O'Kelley",

In Eve, she escaped becoming a forced child-bearer only to discover that she had been specially marked by the King of New America and could not get away so easily. Here, she is being sheltered in an enclave for escaped women, another look at the series' theme of separation and distrust between the genders. When she is drawn out of her safe haven to search for her lost true love, Caleb, all does not go as planned. A twist quickly changes Eve's situation, but unfortunately fails to make her story any more probable. Likewise, detailed explanations of the formation of New America don't illuminate the story so much as reveal the poor foundation on which it is constructed.

Frank Baum'sTheWonderful Wizard of Oz \"occupies a unique position in the cultural fabric of this country.\" Editor Peter Glassman (Oz: The HundredthAnniversary Celebration) calls the story \"quintessentially American.\" Yet it has a universal appeal--which may account for its translation into many different languages. Although children are often first introduced to the Land of Oz by the classic 1939 movie, the original novel and its many sequels have enchanted both young and old over the years. Published for the centennial, several new books commemorate the beloved story. Readers unacquainted with Oz are sure to find a pleasing version; readers who already know the story will find something to delight them all over again.InOz: The Hundredth Anniversary Celebration,Peter Glassman presents art and words from children's book authors and illustrators who are big fans of Oz and here pay homage to \"the enchanted land that inspired them and helped shape their imaginations.\" The paintings, in each artist's recognizable style, lovingly convey the essence of Oz, making this truly wonderful. Contributions come from Tomie dePaola, who imagines himself going down the yellow brick road instead of Dorothy; Paul O. Zelinsky, who shared the Oz experience with his children; Uri Shulevitz, who escaped from hunger and war during the 1940s in the pages ofThe Wonderful Wizard of Oz; Richard Egielski, whose childhood defense against the ghastly flying monkeys was to lie absolutely still in bed; Natalie Babbitt, Peter Sis, Bruce Degen, Lloyd Alexander, and many others.

The standout pop-ups are prints created from cut blocks of linoleum, with sparkling touches of colored foil that add pizzazz. Sabuda's art evokes that of Denslow, including the silver, rather than ruby, slippers, and once again, his mastery of his craft enhances and enchants. A good selection for story hours.Also now available is Henry Holt's reissue of its 1982 version of the book, with artwork by the well-known children's book illustrator Michael Hague.

        "0060393203": "Had Maxted published this sharp, witty tale of a British woman's love life and real life before the Bridget Jones phenomenon, Fielding's novel might have been noted as a pale comparison. Written in a hip, readable, often poignant and always funny style, protagonist Helen Bradshaw's story is set in modern-day London, where the 20-something editorial assistant comes to terms with her father's death and her own life. The plot spans one year, beginning with the day Helen learns of her father's fatal heart attack. Helen struggles with faithless boyfriend, Jasper; her self-centered but sexy landlord, Marcus; and her solipsistic \"best friend,\" Michelle. Meanwhile, her demanding and unsupportive boss at GirlTime magazine cracks the whip. A complex part of Helen's healing process is repairing her relationship with her overbearing mother, Cecilia, who, though she mourns her husband inconsolably, eventually finds new direction in her life. Helen discovers real love in the patient and humorous veterinarian, Tom, and she learns enough about real friendship to hold onto her loyal, true buddies Lizzy, Luke and Tina, saving the latter's life in the process. As she stumbles from one crisis to another, Helen is always likable, even if the decisions she makes often make the reader want to give her a good shake. Although the narrative tackles many issues, from the loss of a parent to the horrors of domestic violence, Maxted's bouncy, upbeat tone never falters. Revealing a touch for comic timing and versatility, she paints scenes of hilarious pratfalls, biting sarcasm and heart-wrenching pathos. While comparison between this work and Fielding's is unavoidable, Maxted's laugh-out-loud debut novel will come out ahead. (June)Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.",

Rather than telling a new story, she tells an old one (scarcely lacking for historians) in a fresh way. Shlaes brings to the tale an emphasis on economic realities and consequences, especially when seen from the perspective of monetarist theory, and a focus on particular individuals and events, both celebrated and forgotten (at least relatively so). Thus the spotlight plays not only on Andrew Mellon, Wendell Wilkie and Rexford Tugwell but also on Father Divine and the Schechter brothers&mdash;kosher butcher wholesalers prosecuted by the federal National Recovery Administration for selling \"sick chickens.\" As befits a former writer for theWall Street Journal, Shlaes is sensitive to the dangers of government intervention in the economy&mdash;but also to the danger of the government's not intervening.

        "0060593083": "InQuicksilver, the first volume of the \"Baroque Cycle,\" Neal Stephenson launches his most ambitious work to date. The novel, divided into three books, opens in 1713 with the ageless Enoch Root seeking Daniel Waterhouse on the campus of what passes for MIT in eighteenth-century Massachusetts. Daniel, Enoch's message conveys, is key to resolving an explosive scientific battle of preeminence between Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz over the development of calculus. As Daniel returns to London aboard theMinerva, readers are catapulted back half a century to recall his years at Cambridge with young Isaac. Daniel is a perfect historical witness. Privy to Robert Hooke's early drawings of microscope images and with associates among the English nobility, religious radicals, and the Royal Society, he also befriends Samuel Pepys, risks a cup of coffee, and enjoys a lecture on Belgian waffles and cleavage-&#x97;all before the year 1700.In the second book, Stephenson introduces Jack Shaftoe and Eliza. \"Half-Cocked\" Jack (also know as the \"King of the Vagabonds\") recovers the English Eliza from a Turkish harem. Fleeing the siege of Vienna, the two journey across Europe driven by Eliza's lust for fame, fortune, and nobility. Gradually, their circle intertwines with that of Daniel in the third book of the novel.The book courses with Stephenson's scholarship but is rarely bogged down in its historical detail. Stephenson is especially impressive in his ability to represent dialogue over the evolving worldview of seventeenth-century scientists and enliven the most abstruse explanation of theory. Though replete with science, the novel is as much about the complex struggles for political ascendancy and the workings of financial markets. Further, the novel's literary ambitions match its physical size. Stephenson narrates through epistolary chapters, fragments of plays and poems, journal entries, maps, drawings, genealogic tables, and copious contemporary epigrams. But, caught in this richness, the prose is occasionally neglected and wants editing. Further, anticipating a cycle, the book does not provide a satisfying conclusion to its 900 pages. These are minor quibbles, though. Stephenson has matched ambition to execution, and his faithful, durable readers will be both entertained and richly rewarded with a practicum in Baroque science, cypher, culture, and politics.--Patrick O'Kelley--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

        "0060589469": "In his now classicZen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, Robert Pirsig brings us a literary chautauqua, a novel that is meant to both entertain and edify. It scores high on both counts.Phaedrus, our narrator, takes a present-tense cross-country motorcycle trip with his son during which the maintenance of the motorcycle becomes an illustration of how we can unify the cold, rational realm of technology with the warm, imaginative realm of artistry. As in Zen, the trick is to become one with the activity, to engage in it fully, to see and appreciate all details--be it hiking in the woods, penning an essay, or tightening the chain on a motorcycle.In his autobiographical first novel, Pirsig wrestles both with the ghost of his past and with the most important philosophical questions of the 20th century--why has technology alienated us from our world? what are the limits of rational analysis? if we can't define the good, how can we live it? Unfortunately, while exploring the defects of our philosophical heritage from Socrates and the Sophists to Hume and Kant, Pirsig inexplicably stops at the middle of the 19th century. With the exception of Poincar&eacute;, he ignores the more recent philosophers who have tackled his most urgent questions, thinkers such as Peirce, Nietzsche (to whom Phaedrus bears a passing resemblance), Heidegger, Whitehead, Dewey, Sartre, Wittgenstein, and Kuhn. In the end, the narrator's claims to originality turn out to be overstated, his reasoning questionable, and his understanding of the history of Western thought sketchy. His solution to a synthesis of the rational and creative by elevating Quality to a metaphysical level simply repeats the mistakes of the premodern philosophers. But in contrast to most other philosophers, Pirsig writes a compelling story. And he is a true innovator in his attempt to popularize a reconciliation of Eastern mindfulness and nonrationalism with Western subject/object dualism. The magic ofZen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenanceturns out to lie not in the answers it gives, but in the questions it raises and the way it raises them. Like a cross betweenThe Razor's EdgeandSophie's World,Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenancetakes us into \"the high country of the mind\" and opens our eyes to vistas of possibility.--Brian Bruya--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

        "009949308X": "Amazon Exclusive: Liaquat Ahamed on the Economic ClimateIn December 1930, the great economist Maynard Keynes published an article in which he described the world as living in &#x201C;the shadows of one of the greatest economic catastrophes in modern history.&#x201D;  The world was then 18 months into what would become the Great Depression. The stock market was down about 60%, profits had fallen in half and unemployed had climbed from 4% to about 10%.If you take our present situation, 16 months into the current recession, we're about at the same place.  The stock market is down 50 to 60 percent, profits are down 50 percent, unemployment is up from 4.5% to over 8%.Over the next 18 months between January 1930 and July 1932 the bottom fell out of the world economy. It did so because the authorities applied the wrong medicine to what was a very sick economy. They let the banking system go under, they tried to cut the budget deficit by curbing government expenditure and raising taxes, they refused to assist the European banking system, and they even raised interest rates. It was no wonder the global economy crumbled.Luckily with the benefit of those lessons, we now know what not to do. This time the authorities are applying the right medicine: they have cut interest rates to zero and are keeping them there, they have saved the banking system from collapse and they have introduced the largest stimulus package in history.And yet I cannot help worrying that the world economy may yet spiral downwards. There are two areas in particular that keep me up at night.The first is the U.S. banking system. Back in the fall, the authorities managed to prevent a financial meltdown. People are not pulling money out of banks anymore&#x2014;in fact, they are putting money in. The problem is that as a consequence of past bad loans, the banking system has lost a good part of its capital. There is no way that the economy can recover unless the banking system is recapitalized. While there are many technical issues about the best way to do this, most experts agree that it will not be done without a massive injection of public money, possibly as much as $1 trillion from you and me, the taxpayer.At the moment tax payers are so furious at the irresponsibility of the bankers who got us into this mess that they are in no mood to support yet more money to bail out banks. It is going to take an extraordinary act of political leadership to persuade the American public that unfortunately more money is necessary to solve this crisis.The second area that keeps me up at night is Europe. During the real estate bubble years, the 13 countries of Eastern Europe that were once part of the Soviet empire had their own bubble. They now owe a gigantic $1.3 trillion dollars, much of which they won&#x2019;t be able to pay. The burden will have to fall on the tax payers of Western Europe, especially Germany and France.In the U.S. we at least have the national cohesion and the political machinery to get New Yorkers and Midwesterners to pay for the mistakes of Californian and Floridian homeowners or to bail out a bank based in North Carolina. There is no such mechanism in Europe. It is going to require political leadership of the highest order from the leaders of Germany and France to persuade their thrifty and prudent taxpayers to bail out foolhardy Austrian banks or Hungarian homeowners.The Great Depression was largely caused by a failure of intellectual will&#x2014;the men in charge simply did not understand how the economy worked. The risk this time round is that a failure of political will leads us into an economic cataclysm.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

The young, British couple runs away to Bristol in search of freedom, and finds it in the form of a \"squat.\" This vacant building is also occupied by two slightly older teens who share everything with Tar and Gemma (including their heroin habits). For a while, everything is parties and adventures, but slowly Tar and Gemma find themselves growing more and more dependent on the drug--whose strict mandates are even less forgiving than those of the parents they fled. As Gemma says, \"You take more and more, and more often. Then you get sick of it and give up for a few days.

The Nunchuk contains the same three-axis motion sensor found in the Wii Remote, but also includes an analog stick, and two buttons to help assist in character movement.Many games will allow you to control your character's movement with the Nunchuk in your left hand, while your right hand is free to execute the action movements with the Wii Remote. For example, the Nunchuk is particularly useful for games like Wii Boxing. You can use the Nunchuk to punch with your weaker hand, while you use the Wii remote to punch and jab with your predominant hand.Take the fun to the next level with two-handed control of your games.View larger.In first-person shooters, the Nunchuk controller carries the burden of movement, freeing you to aim and fire using a more natural motion with the Wii Remote. In a football game, you can make your quarterback elusive with the Nunchuk controller while you search for an open receiver to throw to using the Wii Remote. Serious gamers may even want to use two Nunchuk controllers to gain a fierce competitive edge.Because the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers are only relatively dependent on each other, players are free to hold them in whichever hand is most comfortable. Perfectly suitable for either right or left-hand use, the Wii Nunchuk controller grants accessibility not often seen in previous game controllers.Also, the Nunchuk controller doesn't need its own power--it plugs into the Wii Remote controller when it's in use. So there's no need to worry about charging or replacing expensive batteries.Adding a Nunchuk to your Wii system will definitely help you open the doors to the next level of gaming, and seriously step up performance.

In this new take, players battle the Nazi's dark obsession with the occult through epic action and harrowing shooter combat. Filled with ferocious enemies, movie-quality action scenes, unique gameplay environments, an impressive array of weapons and compelling multiplayer gameplay options, it is truly a fitting new chapter in the history of this classic gaming franchise..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }Battle conventional enemies.View larger.And the supernatural.View larger.Collect and wield 'Veil Powers.'View larger.Explore multiplayer modes.View larger.StoryThe storyline ofWolfensteinpicks up where the events ofReturn to Castle Wolfensteinleft off. You play B.J. Blazkowicz, a highly decorated member of the Office of Secret Actions (OSA). You are sent on a special mission into the heart of the Third Reich to investigate evidence of the Nazi's possession of a new and mysterious power. But while behind enemy lines, you discover they have done much more than develop a new weapon. The Nazis are attempting to harness the supernatural power of an enormous energy source called 'Black Sun' which resides in a parallel dimension called 'The Veil.' Their goal is to use what they find to create supernatural weapons and soldiers of war-ending magnitude. Yours is to stop that from happening by any mean necessary.GameplayEven though the game obviously features loads of Nazi enemies,Wolfensteinis not so much a World War II game, as a game centered around \"dark science\" and \"Supernatural Science fiction.\" In it players move between the the parallel dimension of the Veil and that of our own as they command an enormous arsenal of conventional weapons or unleash the Nazi's own dark powers and perverted science against them with supernatural weapons and Veil-enhanced firepower.One of the major strengths ofWolfensteinis that it allows you to choose the way you want to play. Although as in previous games in the series B.J. is a one man wrecking crew, he also works with a local resistance group. This means that players have the choice to follow the standard missions as they are revealed, take on requests from the resistance to explore the gameplay area and investigate the Nazi experiments, or to tackle the whole endeavor in multiplayer mode.Veil PowerA huge part ofWolfenstein'ssci-fi identification comes via gameplay that relies on the accumulation and use of a number of 'Veil Powers'. These powers though supernatural in origin, are used in large part by B.J. to magnify the effectiveness of his conventional weaponry and tactics. A sampling of these powers include: 'Mire,' which allows you to slow down time around B.J. so that he can take out enemies and obstructions such as machine gun nests, without the risk of taking severe damage; 'Veil Sight,' a sort of supernatural night vision that helps you see enemies in the dark; and 'Veil Shield,' which absorbs bullet fire and can be used as a battering ram in some circumstances. As with all the weapons in the game, all Veil Powers can be upgraded and indeed must be in some cases to proceed through the game.A notable caveat that comes along with the mastery of Veil Powers is that they do not necessarily guarantee overall success. As the game proceeds, the Nazis become aware of B.J. and his understanding and use of these powers and in response distribute 'Veil Inhibitors,' devices that negate the use of these Veil-powered abilities within range of them. This opens up a puzzle-solving aspect withinWolfensteinthat require players to explore the environments around them to find the inhibitors and destroy them in order to proceed.Key FeaturesAmazing Enemies- You never know what ferocious enemies the Nazis will throw at you next as they bring their dark fantasies to life.Epic Combat Moments- Experience movie-like epic action sequences as you fight to prevent the Nazis from unleashing the power of the Black Sun, a war-ending weapon of supernatural mass destruction.Unique Environments- Explore the mysteries of The Veil, a world between our reality and the occult underworld that offers you combat advantages but also new supernatural threats.Impressive Firepower- Go to battle with a diverse collection of Allied, Axis and experimental Nazi weapons. Earn gold by working with the resistance fighters, purchase upgrades in the black market, and customize your personal arsenal.Classic Wolfenstein Multiplayer with an Occult Twist- Revisit the heart-pounding and award winning class and objective based multiplayer ofReturn to Castle Wolfenstein; now with occult-enhanced firepower.WeaponsWolfensteinfeatures a wide array of Allied, Axis and supernatural Nazi weapons.

A witty omniscient narrator speaks directly to modern readers and follows 15-year-old Penelope, recent graduate of the Swanburne Academy for Poor Bright Females, to British country manor Ashton Place, where conniving Lord Fredrick has discovered three wild children apparently raised by wolves while hunting in his vast forest property. To Lord Fredrick, who's named them Alexander, Beowulf, and Cassiopeia Incorrigible, the children are trophies and property (\"Finder's keepers, what?\"); to young Lady Constance they're savage nuisances who howl, chase squirrels, and gnaw on shoes. Enter Penelope Lumley, charged with taming them in time for a Christmas party, and bolstered by her top-notch classical education and an endless supply of platitudes from Agatha Swanburne. She also comes armed with a cherished book of poetry and her favorite fiction series, \"Giddy-Yap, Rainbow!\" There are stock characters, and there are mysteries. Most of all, without taking itself too seriously, there is commentary on writing itself, the dangers and the benefits of relying on books for moral courage, and the perils of drawing false expectations of the world from literature. Penelope shows growth, confronting issues of social class and expectation versus reality, and eventually realizing her own capacity for insight. Humorous antics and a climactic cliff-hanger ending will keep children turning pages and clamoring for the next volume, while more sophisticated readers will take away much more.

In rough chronological order, Roberts introduces a variety of women, mostly wives, sisters or mothers of key men, exploring how they used their wit, wealth or connections to influence the men who made policy. As high-profile players married into each other's families, as wives died in childbirth and husbands remarried, it seems as if early America-or at least its upper crust-was indeed a very small world. Roberts's style is delightfully intimate and confiding: on the debate over Mrs. Benedict Arnold's infamy, she proclaims, \"Peggy was in it from the beginning.\" Roberts also has an ear for juicy quotes; she recounts Aaron Burr's mother, Esther, bemoaning that when talking to a man with \"mean thoughts of women,\" her tongue \"hangs pretty loose,\" so she \"talked him quite silent.\" In addition to telling wonderful stories, Roberts also presents a very readable, serviceable account of politics-male and female-in early America.

Along the way, Wolf introduces concepts like \"word poverty,\" the situation in which children, by age five, have heard 32 million less words than their counterparts (with chilling long-term effects), and makes time for amusing and affecting anecdotes, like the only child she knew to fake a reading disorder (attempting to get back into his beloved literacy training program). Though it could probably command a book of its own, the sizable third section of the book covers the complex topic of dyslexia, explaining clearly and expertly \"what happens when the brain can't learn to read.\" One of those rare books that synthesizes cutting edge, interdisciplinary research with the inviting tone of a curious, erudite friend (think Malcolm Gladwell), Wolf's first book for a general audience is an eye-opening winner, and deserves a wide readership.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0062024027": "A Q&amp;A with Author Veronica RothQ:What advice would you offer to young aspiring writers, who long to live a success story like your own?Roth:One piece of advice I have is: Want something else more than success. Success is a lovely thing, but your desire to say something, your worth, and your identity shouldn&rsquo;t rely on it, because it&rsquo;s not guaranteed and it&rsquo;s not permanent and it&rsquo;s not sufficient. So work hard, fall in love with the writing&mdash;the characters, the story, the words, the themes&mdash;and make sure that you are who you are regardless of your life circumstances. That way, when the good things come, they don&rsquo;t warp you, and when the bad things hit you, you don&rsquo;t fall apart.Q:You&rsquo;re a young author--is it your current adult perspective or not-so-recent teenage perspective that brought about the factions in the development of this story? Do you think that teens or adults are more likely to fit into categories in our current society?Roth:Other aspects of my identity have more to do with the factions than my age. The faction system reflects my beliefs about human nature&mdash;that we can make even something as well-intentioned as virtue into an idol, or an evil thing. And that virtue as an end unto itself is worthless to us. I did spend a large portion of my adolescence trying to be as &ldquo;good&rdquo; as possible so that I could prove my worth to the people around me, to myself, to God, to everyone. It&rsquo;s only now that I&rsquo;m a little older that I realize I am unable to be truly &ldquo;good&rdquo; and that it&rsquo;s my reasons for striving after virtue that need adjustment more than my behavior. In a sense,Divergentis me writing through that realization&mdash;everyone in Beatrice&rsquo;s society believes that virtue is the end, the answer. I think that&rsquo;s a little twisted.I think we all secretly love and hate categories&mdash;love to get a firm hold on our identities, but hate to be confined&mdash;and I never loved and hated them more than when I was a teenager. That said: Though we hear a lot about high school cliques, I believe that adults categorize each other just as often, just in subtler ways. It is a dangerous tendency of ours. And it begins in adolescence.Q:If you could add one more faction to the world withinDivergent, what would it be?Roth:I tried to construct the factions so that they spanned a wide range of virtues. Abnegation, for example, includes five of the traditional &ldquo;seven heavenly virtues:&rdquo; chastity, temperance, charity, patience, and humility. That said, it would be interesting to have a faction centered on industriousness, in which diligence and hard work are valued most, and laziness is not allowed. They would be in constant motion, and would probably be happy to take over for the factionless. And hard-working people can certainly take their work too far, as all the factions do with their respective virtues. I&rsquo;m not sure what they would wear, though. Overalls, probably.Q:What do you think are the advantages, if any, to the society you&rsquo;ve created inDivergent?Roth:All the advantages I see only seem like advantages to me because I live in our current society. For example, the members of their society don&rsquo;t focus on certain things: race, religion, sexual orientation, political affiliation, etc. I mean, a world in which you look different from the majority and no one minds? That sounds good to me. But when I think about it more, I realize that they&rsquo;re doing the exact same thing we do, but with different criteria by which to distinguish ourselves from others. Instead of your skin color, it&rsquo;s the color of your shirt that people assess, or the results of your aptitude test. Same problem, different system.Q:What book are you currently reading and how has it changed you, if at all?Roth:I recently finishedImaginary Girlsby Nova Ren Suma, which I would call &ldquo;contemporary with a paranormal twist,&rdquo; or something to that effect. It&rsquo;s about a girl whose sister has a powerful kind of magnetism within the confines of a particular town, and how their love for each other breaks some things apart and puts other things back together. It was refreshing to read a young adult book that is about sisterhood instead of romance. It&rsquo;s one of those books that makes you love a character and then hate a character and then love them again&mdash;that shows you that people aren&rsquo;t all good or all bad, but somewhere in between.Imaginary Girlsgave me a lot to think about, and the writing was lovely, which I always love to see.",

Someone is targeting the British royal family for assassination, starting years earlier with Charles's uncle, Lord Mountbatten.

        "0064408639": "As the three Baudelaire orphans warily approach their new home--Prufrock  Preparatory School--they can't help but notice the enormous stone arch bearing  the school's mottoMemento Mori, or \"Remember you will die.\" This is not  a cheerful greeting, and certainly marks an inauspicious beginning to a very  bleak story. Of course, this is what we have come to expect from Lemony  Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events, the deliciously morbid set of books that  began withThe Bad  Beginningand only got worse.InThe Austere Academy, Violet, Klaus, and Sunny are at first  optimistic--attending school is a welcome change for the book-loving trio, and  the academy is allegedly safe from the dreaded Count Olaf, who is after their  fortune. Hope dissipates quickly, however, when they meet Vice Principal Nero, a  self-professed genius violinist who sneeringly imitates their every word. More  dreadful still, he houses them in the tin Orphans Shack, crawling with  toe-biting crabs and dripping with a mysterious tan fungus. A beam of light  shines through the despair when the Baudelaires meet the Quagmires, two of three  orphaned triplets who are no strangers to disaster and sympathize with their  predicament. When Count Olaf appears on the scene disguised as Coach Genghis  (covering his monobrow with a turban and his ankle tattoo with expensive running  shoes), the Quagmires resolve to come to the aid of their new friends. Sadly,  this proves to be a hideous mistake.Snicket disarms us again with his playful juxtapositions--only he can compare  bombs with strawberry shortcake (both are as dangerous to make as assumptions),  muse on how babies adjust developmentally to the idea of curtains, or ponder why  the Baudelaire orphans would not want to be stalks of celery despite their  incessant bad luck as humans. We can't get enough of this splendid series of  misadventures, and can only wager that swarms of young readers will be right  next to us in line for the next installment.

The choice is yours ininfamous.caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }Everyman turned superhero Cole.View larger.Devastating electricity-based powers.View larger.Go anywhere open-world design.View larger.An organic urban environment.View larger.StoryEmpire City was a run of the mill metropolis, until one day a massive explosion rips through six square blocks of its bustling downtown real-estate, seemingly leveling everything and everyone in its path. Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers. Learn how to adapt to Cole&rsquo;s evolving powers in an attempt to save Empire City and its people.Super Powers- Feel what it is like to discover, grow and use a wide range of electricity-based super powers (good or bad); and grasp the responsibility that comes from being so powerful.Epic Battles- Experience what it is like to be a true hero, taking responsibility for every action, as players battle against powerful iconic villains.Open Dynamic World- Coupling rich powers with a reactive environment and population, experience complete freedom to explore a deep, open interactive city.

        "0061097934": "Veteran bestselling author Leon Uris (Exodus,Trinity)  stays true to form withA God in Ruins, delivering yet another vast and vigorous novel about politics and history, right and wrong, love and loss. This time his country of choice is the United States, on the eve of the 2008 presidential election.The incumbent, Thornton Tomtree, is running against the Catholic governor of Colorado, Quinn Patrick O'Connell. Thornton, who grew up playing in his daddy's Providence junkyard, made billions on a computer invention before becoming president. Brainy, calculating, and stiff, he lacks both charm and scruples--qualities that the honest and open Quinn, an ex-Marine, has in spades. Though set in 2008,A God in Ruinshas its roots firmly in the past. In order to flesh out his characters, Uris casts his net all the way back to World War II, highlighting some of the more dramatic moments in Thornton and Quinn's lives as they move inexorably from youth towards a run for the White House. In the process, Uris takes up some of the attention-grabbing political issues in America from the second half of the 20th century: gun control, terrorist attacks, and Clinton's sex scandals.Uris can always be counted on to inject the political with the personal, and Quinn is the perfect vehicle for this when his presidential bid is threatened at the eleventh hour by potentially damning information about his past. A lively supporting cast of characters--from Quinn's delicious wife Rita to Thornton's conflicted right-hand man Darnell--adds spark to this emotional story. At one point, when the campaign has reached a fever pitch, Thornton says about Quinn, \"Our jingle-jangle rope-a-dope cowboy is going to be a handful.\" So is Uris's engaging book, which positively spills over with simple heroism and hot-button political issues.--Katherine Anderson--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

        "0064410161": "Picking up from the final pages of thePentultimate Peril, this farewell installment to the ridiculously (and deservedly!) popularA Series of Unfortunate Eventsplaces our protagonists right where we last left them: on a large, wooden boat in the middle of the ocean, trapped with their nemesis Count Olaf, who has armed himself with a helmet-full of deadly Medusoid Mycelium.The situation quickly and--this being the Baudelaires--predictably deteriorates. Violet, Klaus, and Sunny find themselves tossed in a storm so terrible that our beloved narrator spends four pages describing how he cannot describe it. From this point on, fans of the series' smarty-pants wordplay and acrobatic narrative can rest assured that they're in for more of the same (and how) in this 368-page finale, and Daniel Handler's deadpan Snicket continues to tutor a generation in self-referential humor (including one particularly funny bit regarding three very short men carrying a large, flat piece of wood, painted to look like a living room). Snicket notes, of course, that if you read the entire series, \"your only reward will be 170 chapters of misery in your library and countless tears in your eyes.\"There's one big question, though, for anyone who's made it through \"the thirteenth chapter of the thirteenth volume in this sad history\": is the final book a fitting end? That question is probably best-answered by one ofThe End's most oft-repeated phrases: It depends on how you look at it. Those looking for conclusive resolution to the series' many, many mysteries may be disappointed, although some big questions do get explicit answers. Not surprisingly for a work so deliberately labyrinthine, though, even the absence of an answer can be sort of an answer--and reaction toThe Endcan be something of a Rorschach test for readers. Or, as Lemony Snicket says, \"Perhaps you don&#x92;t know yet what the end really means.\"--Paul Hughes",

Yet the 160GB system manages to improve on this with its 45nm version of the processor, which although running at the same 60+nm speed as previous PS3 versions, uses less energy. This makes the unit's smaller size and quieter fan possible. Along with the traditional AV and composite connections, the 160GB system also boasts an HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) port, which delivers uncompressed, unconverted digital picture and sound to compatible high-definition TVs and projectors. (The system is capable of 128-bit pixel precision and 1080p resolution for a full HD experience) This console also provides for an extreme sound experience by supporting Dolby Digital 5.1, DTS 5.1, as well as Linear PCM 7.1. Finally, it features cross connectivity with your PC network and PlayStation Portable (PSP) and its pre-installed, 160GB hard disc drive allows you to save games as well as download content from The Internet.

If you&#x2019;re new to Kellerman, though, this is not the place to start. Kellerman works primarily in dialogue, with very sketchy narrative support, which requires readers unfamiliar with the backstory to act as their own detectives, figuring out what the heck is going on in each scene. The plot maintains a breakneck pace&#x2014;we move from the Deckers at dinner getting a call from a distressed teen to the teen&#x2019;s revelation that his parents are missing from their hotel to the further revelation that Decker worked on a homicide case 15 years ago in which the now-absent father falsely confessed to murdering his high-school sweetheart, went to jail, and emerged as a hired killer. There goes dinner. Decker and Lazarus have to track down all these moving pieces. Meanwhile, a neonatal nurse with a wild private life is found brutally murdered. Naturally, we have to confront the fact that there may be a serial killer at work.

Despite his loving parents' best efforts, John's attempts to meet their expectations failed spectacularly. Whether it was his disastrous first confession, the use of his hobby telescope to take in the bronzed Mrs. Selahowski sunbathing next door, the purloined swigs of sacramental wine, or, as he got older, the fumbled attempts to sneak contraband past his father and score with girls beneath his mother's vigilant radar, John was figuring out that the faith and fervor that came so effortlessly to his parents somehow had eluded him.And then one day, a strong-willed young woman named Jenny walked into his life.

At least, that is Lady Xenobia India St. Clair&#x2019;s initial assessment when Thorn&#x2019;s stepmother, Eleanor, hires India to redecorate Starberry Court, the rundown country estate Thorn has recently purchased. Thorn is certain that his acquisition of Starberry Court will convince Laetitia Rainsford to accept his offer of marriage. India is equally convinced that if the ramshackle country estate doesn&#x2019;t scare Laetitia away, Thorn&#x2019;s own rough-around-the-edges appearance (not to mention his ancestry) will certainly do the trick. However, Eleanor is one of her dearest friends, and India has never yet backed down from a challenge. So, if all she has is three weeks to transform Starberry Court into a properly running home and turn Thorn into a civilized gentleman, India will just have to make it work.

        "B0002A6CQ4": "The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect. It looks too good to be trueSound:Great voice acting, stress-inducing music, and disturbing sound effects combine to create the perfect atmospherePlayability:The controls are fashioned beautifully, boss fights are ingenious, and the popping of heads is immensely rewardingEntertainment:Hard to put down even after you've beaten it twiceReplay:Moderately HighRated:10 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:Some games are simply destined to become milestones in gaming history, and Resident Evil 4 is one of them. Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it. Capcom has managed to create a game that is a complete reinvention of the series &#8211; even the entire genre &#8211; without losing anything that Resident Evil fans expect. Perfectly balancing elements of horror, subtlety, and wit with explosive action and over-the-top thrills, playing RE 4 feels like living one of the most epic films you've ever seen. Gorgeous to look at, a dream to control, and filled with some of the most exciting moments you've experienced in a game, Resident Evil 4 is stellar on every level. It goes without saying that it's the best in the series, the best survival horror game yet, and simply one of the best games ever made.Rated:10 out of 10Editor:Jeremy ZossSubscribe to Game Informer--Amazon.com",

When his twin sister, Bront&#xEB;, befriends their shy and withdrawn classmate Brewster &#x201C;Bruiser&#x201D; Rawlins, he is concerned that her relationship with this boy from the wrong side of the tracks will prove somehow dangerous. After he spies Bruiser changing in the locker room and notices that his back is covered in scars and welts, he becomes even more certain that the teen and his family are bad news. In spite of her brother's warnings, Bront&#xEB; continues her relationship with Bruiser, drawing him closer to her family&ndash;and Tennyson&ndash;in the process. The twins begin to notice Bruiser's unusual talent: not only can he assume the physical pain and wounds of those he cares about, but he can also absorb their anger, hurt, and grief. Told from the three characters' alternating perspectives, with Brewster's rendered in poetic form, Shusterman's novel reveals its secrets and their implications slowly, allowing readers to connect the dots before the characters do and encouraging them to weigh the price of Bruiser's &#x201C;gift&#x201D; against the freedom from pain that Tennyson and Bront&#xEB; enjoy.Amy S.

        "0099451956": "Caldwell and Thomason's intriguing intellectual suspense novel stars four brainy roommates at Princeton, two of whom have links to a mysterious 15th-century manuscript, theHypnerotomachia Poliphili. This rare text (a real book) contains embedded codes revealing the location of a buried Roman treasure. Comparisons toThe Da Vinci Codeare inevitable, but Caldwell and Thomason's book is the more cerebral-and better written-of the two: think Dan Brown by way of Donna Tartt and Umberto Eco. The four seniors are Tom Sullivan, Paul Harris, Charlie Freeman and Gil Rankin. Tom, the narrator, is the son of a Renaissance scholar who spent his life studying the ancient book, \"an encyclopedia masquerading as a novel, a dissertation on everything from architecture to zoology.\" The manuscript is also an endless source of fascination for Paul, who sees it as \"a siren, a fetching song on a distant shore, all claws and clutches in person. You court her at your risk.\" This debut novel's range of topics almost rivals theHypnerotomachia's itself, including etymology, Renaissance art and architecture, Princeton eating clubs, friendship, steganography (riddles) and self-interpreting manuscripts. It's a complicated, intricate and sometimes difficult read, but that's the point and the pleasure. There are murders, romances, dangers and detection, and by the end the heroes are in a race not only to solve the puzzle, but also to stay alive. Readers might be tempted to buy their own copy of theHypnerotomachiaand have a go at the puzzle. After all, Caldwell and Thomason have done most of the heavy deciphering-all that's left is to solve the final riddle, head for Rome and start digging.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Twelve-year-old Odd hasn't had a good couple of years: his father died rescuing a pony that fell overboard during a Viking raid, his leg was crippled during a tree-felling accident, and his mother married a man he dislikes. So, in the midst of what should be spring (\"Winter hung in there, like an invalid refusing to die\"), he sets out for a cabin in the wilderness, figuring that anything will be better than home. Soon after arriving, a fox leads him to an enormous bear whose paw is caught in a tree; a large eagle circles overhead. Odd shows kindness and bravery when helping the bear, learning afterward that these three animals are gods who have been transformed by the Frost Giant. Odd is determined to help them, and his ultimate encounter with the Frost Giant is especially interesting, tweaking the tradition of small boys getting the better of giants. Readers will also enjoy Odd's interaction with the animals, Gaiman's simple and graceful writing, and the satisfying conclusion.&mdash;Lauralyn Persson, Wilmette Public Library, ILEND",

Worlds are destroyed and cultures collide when a tsunami hits islands in a vast ocean much like the Pacific. Mau, a boy on his way back home from his initiation period and ready for the ritual that will make him a man, is the only one of his people, the Nation, to survive. Ermintrude, a girl from somewhere like Britain in a time like the 19th century, is on her way to meet her father, the governor of the Mothering Sunday islands. She is the sole survivor of her ship (or so she thinks), which is wrecked on Mau's island. She reinvents herself as Daphne, and uses her wits and practical sense to help the straggling refugees from nearby islands who start arriving. When raiders land on the island, they are led by a mutineer from the wrecked ship, and Mau must use all of his ingenuity to outsmart him. Then, just as readers are settling in to thinking that all will be well in the new world that Daphne and Mau are helping to build, Pratchett turns the story on its head. The main characters are engaging and interesting, and are the perfect medium for the author's sly humor. Daphne is a close literary cousin of Tiffany Aching in her common sense and keen intelligence wedded to courage.

As the samurai Samanosuke,  players volunteer to rescue the kidnapped princess Yuki. No surprise  that the ultimate goal (and the entire story line, for that matter)  falls by the wayside as hordes of demons converge on the player hour  after hour. The weapons system benefits from the flashy graphics--as  players discover and add gems to a gauntlet, weapon upgrades increase  firepower with increasingly dramatic effects.Graphically, the game is stunning. Carving through the levels--forests,  tunnels, and the requisite dark, dank castle environment--isn't  anything less than a spectacular experience, thanks much in part to the  game's unusually high production values. Character models are built  from up to 10,000 polygons each--high detail, even for a PS2 game.  Subtle environmental effects--the wind flowing through the trees, for  instance, ripples the fabric in characters' clothes--furthers the  game's realism. The game's backgrounds are painstakingly detailed and  nicely enhanced by dynamic lighting effects.The talent behind the aural effects is just as impressive.

        "B000087H7T": "Early Adopters Pick: March 2003. As the  world's smallest video-game platform, the Game Boy Advance SP is also the first to use a built-in rechargeable battery.Many decried the original Game Boy Advance's reflective LCD screen and its reliance on external light sources. The Game Boy Advance SP's main feature--optional backlighting--fixes this complaint nicely, but it's the wealth of other features that makes this system so surprisingly good.At first look, you might think the SP is a sleek travel alarm clock. When closed, it's just as tall and deep as the original GBA, but only half as wide. Due to its clamshell design, the screen is always protected from everyday scratches. A small button in the center of the console turns on the backlighting element for use in low-light situations, like in a moving car.The SP comes with a well-designed power adapter that recharges a built-in battery; its prongs fold in for easier storage. Our informal tests found that it takes about four hours to fully charge (you can even play it while it's plugged in and charging), and the battery lasts about 11 hours with the backlighting constantly on--your results may vary. Using the backlighting less often will conserve battery power.Withseparately sold  cables, you can connect the Game Boy Advance SP to other GBAs  for multiplayer gaming (above) or to theNintendo GameCube(below) to access secret levels, exchange data, or use other special  features that vary from game to game.The quality of the backlighting is very good. It's bright and clear when looking directly at it, but degraded from other angles. This is only a problem for friends who are watching the screen from over your shoulder.But size, power, and affordability do not come without trade offs. There's no headphone jack here, though Nintendo promises an adapter. The system isn't very loud at its highest volume, and the sound can be turned down to socially acceptable levels. The L and R shoulder buttons are a fraction of the size they were on the GBA, and thus are harder to hit. Also, the reduced size of the SP is slightly less comfortable for adult hands than the GBA, but perhaps more comfortable for smaller hands. The cartridge port placement on the lower part of the console is fine for GBA games, since they are flush with the console body, but older Game Boy Color carts will stick out in a way that takes some getting used to.Open it up and the hinge will seek out a preferred, pre-set angle (about 150 degrees), though you can open it a bit wider or narrower for your own comfort. The hinge stands up well to lateral pressure, and over all, the SP seems just as rugged as its predecessor--which has proven to be very rugged, indeed.--Porter B.

The story follows several space-dwelling citizens as they aim to unlock the secrets of the universe. The specifics of those secrets presumably will be revealed over subsequent editions of the Xenosaga series (after all, this is onlyEpisode 1)--but a vital clue is held in the elusive Zohar, a mysterious artifact that is aggressively sought by evil aliens. Without spoiling the plot's surprising twists, let's just say the game's German subtitle \"Der Wille zur Macht\" (translated as \"The Will to Power\") is a less-than-subtle ode to German philosopherFriedrich Nietzsche, who is considered as one of the precursors of existentialism.Like many conventional RPG titles,Xenosaga's gameplay balances between exploration and battle modes. The game designers have thankfully spared players from any ill-conceived random battle sequences. Instead, you can concentrate directly on your quest without the repetitious enemy battles.The designers also did a good job balancing a traditional RPG structure with complex themes. However, the game seems to go out of its way to casually integrate controversial (and frankly creepy) religious imagery into the context of the game. Some may find the game offensive and disturbing; others will likely find it intellectually stimulating.Namco promises about 80 hours of gaming--but a good portion of that is non-interactive full-motion video. While the stretched-out cutscenes do add considerable depth to the characters, they're often poorly paced and too long--one takes an alarming 30 minutes to unfold! The addition of more background music might have helped to pick up the pacing, since the obligatory soundtrack is strangely absent at some critical plot points.With impressive animation and unexpected plot points,Xenosaga: Episode 1--Der Wille zer Machtis easily one of the more enjoyable RPG titles to hit the PS2. While this isn't for the happy-go-lucky gaming crowd (seeKingdom Hearts), adult-minded gamers will likely be consumed by the darkness and devious delights offered within this twisted title.--Brett AtwoodPros:Complex characters and story themesNo random battle sequencesImpressive 3-D animationCons:Long, long, looooooooong cut scenes",

Equipped with state-of-the-art weapons, Team Rainbow is deployed during terrorist crises. When all other attempts have failed, Rainbow is brought in to save the lives of  innocent people. They do not negotiate with terror. They destroy it.Rainbow began as an idea shared by John Clark and Domingo \"Ding\" Chavez. Clark, a former Navy SEAL and CIA operative, met Chavez during a covert  operation in Colombia. During the operation, Chavez was rescued by Clark. After that mission, Chavez joined the Central Intelligence Agency. Clark and Chavez developed a mentor-student relationship over the course of several missions together.Rainbow was created in 2000. Ding Chavez was made a Team Leader and began recruiting counter-terrorism operatives immediately. Experts in  close-quarters combat, demolitions, electronics, surveillances, and  reconnaissance were recruited. Snipers, hackers, soldiers, policemen, and contractors were all brought to Hereford, England, where Rainbow shares its headquarters with the British Special Air Service.",

        "0091795273": "An exhaustive, soul-searching memoir, Bill Clinton'sMy Lifeis a refreshingly candid look at the former president as a son, brother, teacher, father, husband, and public figure. Clinton painstakingly outlines the history behind his greatest successes and failures, including his dedication to educational and economic reform, his war against a \"vast right-wing operation\" determined to destroy him, and the \"morally indefensible\" acts for which he was nearly impeached.My Lifeis autobiography as therapy--a personal history written by a man trying to face and banish his private demons.Clinton approaches the story of his youth with gusto, sharing tales of giant watermelons, nine-pound tumors, a charging ram, famous mobsters and jazz musicians, and a BB gun standoff. He offers an equally energetic portrait of American history, pop culture, and the evolving political landscape, covering the historical events that shaped his early years (namely the deaths of Martin Luther King Jr. and JFK) and the events that shaped his presidency (Waco, Bosnia, Somalia). What makesMy Liferemarkable as a political memoir is how thoroughly it is infused with Clinton's unassuming, charmingly pithy voice:I learned a lot from the stories my uncle, aunts, and grandparents told me: that no one is perfect but most people are good; that people can't be judged only by their worst or weakest moments; that harsh judgments can make hypocrites of us all; that a lot of life is just showing up and hanging on; that laughter is often the best, and sometimes the only, response to pain.However, that same voice might tire readers as Clinton applies his penchant for minute details to a distractible laundry list of events, from his youth through the years of his presidency. Not wanting to forget a single detail that might help account for his actions, Clinton overdoes it--do we really need to know the name of his childhood barber? But when Clinton sticks to the meat of his story--recollections about Mother, his abusive stepfather, Hillary, the campaign trail, and Kenneth Starr--the veracity of emotion andKitchen Confidential-type revelations about \"what it is like to be President\" makeMy Lifeimpossible to put down.To Clinton, \"politics is a contact sport,\" and while he claims thatMy Lifeis not intended to make excuses or assign blame, it does portray him as a fighter whose strategy is to \"take the first hit, then counterpunch as hard as I could.\" WhileMy Lifeis primarily a stroll through Clinton's memories, it is also a scathing rebuke--a retaliation against his detractors, including Kenneth Starr, whose \"mindless search for scandal\" protected the guilty while \"persecuting the innocent\" and distracted his Administration from pressing international matters (including strikes on al Qaeda). Counterpunch indeed.At its core,My Lifeis a charming and intriguing if flawed book by an equally intriguing and flawed man who had his worst failures and humiliations made public. Ultimately, the man who left office in the shadow of scandal offers an honest and open account of his life, allowing readers to witness his struggle to \"drain the most out of every moment\" while maintaining the character with which he was raised. It is a remarkably intimate, persuasive look at the boy he was, the President he became, and man he is today.--Daphne Durham--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",
        "0099574918": "It's about time that people looking for a good read discovered the novels of Richard Russo. It's not just that he writes with panache, his verbal dexterity a mixture of biting wit and potent insight. He also endows his subjects-- blue-collar people living in economically desperate communities--with dignity, finding in their humble circumstances the essential questions of existence. Yet here as in his previous novels, Mohawk and The Risk Pool , the events in his protagonist's life are the material of rollicking high comedy. A succession of contretemps conspire to keep Donald \"Sully\" Sullivan mired in a morass of bad luck, compounded at every turn by his own stubborn, self-destructive streak. Financial solvency has always eluded Sully, an unemployed construction worker. At 60, he is suffering from a badly mangled, constantly aching knee, the consequence of a typically foolish accident; his pickup truck is moribund; his long-time mistress is restive; his ex-wife is on the verge of a nervous breakdown and his son Peter has come home for Thanksgiving with news that his marriage is disintegrating and that he has lost his job. Sully's sagging fortunes are mirrored by his community's decline. North Bath, N.Y., is a town prosperity has shunned: its signature hot springs mysteriously dried up years ago and a projected Ultimate Escape theme park is doomed never to materialize. Sully's financial problems might be solved by the sale of his dead father's dilapidated house, but Sully's gnawing hatred of Big Jim, a viciously mean, hypocritical bully, renders him incapable of profiting from his father's estate. His emotional distance from Big Jim left Sully incapable of forging a bond with Peter, or indeed, of establishing any relationship that he cannot address with a wisecrack or a teasing quip. In fact (and somewhat improbably), all the characters in the novel have the gift of a silver tongue: the dialogue often consists of verbal sparring, insults exhanged in comradely fashion. The narrative brims with memorable portraits: Sully's mentally dim and odoriferous sidekick, Rub Squeers; his feisty 80-year-old landlady and former grade-school teacher, Miss Beryl; his ex-wife, a woman animated by moral outrage and self pity; his mistress's stiletto-tongued daughter and her waif-like, wall-eyed child; his one-legged alcoholic lawyer--even his thoroughly wicked grandson, the pint-sized reincarnation of Big Jim. In delivering these personalities with a Dickensian skill, Russo again proves himself a shrewd observer of human nature, whose universal failings he scrutinizes with a comic eye and a compassionate heart. 50,000 first printing; major ad/promo; author tour.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

Welcomed inside, the Storyteller lights his pipe and begins, telling of the architect of Newgrange, who built \"a marvelous, immortal structure... before Stonehenge in England, before the pyramids of Egypt,\" and the dentally challenged King Conor of Ulster, who tried, and failed, to outsmart his wife.

To complete the picture, there's even a &quot;helium balloon drifting dreamily across the wooded valley.&quot; But as Joe and Clarissa watch the balloon touch down, their idyll comes to an abrupt end. The pilot catches his leg in the anchor rope, while the only passenger, a boy, is too scared to jump down. As the wind whips into action, Joe and four other men rush to secure the basket. Mother Nature, however, isn't feeling very maternal. &quot;A mighty fist socked the balloon in two rapid blows, one-two, the second more vicious than the first,&quot; and at once the rescuers are airborne. Joe manages to drop to the ground, as do most of his companions, but one man is lifted sky-high, only to fall to his death.In itself, the accident would change the survivors' lives, filling them with an uneasy combination of shame, happiness, and endless self-reproach. (In one of the novel's many ironies, the balloon eventually lands safely, the boy unscathed.) But fate has far more unpleasant things in store for Joe. Meeting the eye of fellow rescuer Jed Parry, for example, turns out to be a very bad move. For Jed is instantly obsessed, making the first of many calls to Joe and Clarissa's London flat that very night. Soon he's openly shadowing Joe and writing him endless letters. (One insane epistle begins, &quot;I feel happiness running through me like an electrical current. I close my eyes and see you as you were last night in the rain, across the road from me, with the unspoken love between us as strong as steel cable.&quot;) Worst of all, Jed's version of love comes to seem a distortion of Joe's feelings for Clarissa.Apart from the incessant stalking, it is the conditionals--the contingencies--that most frustrate Joe, a scientific journalist. If only he and Clarissa had gone straight home from the airport... If only the wind hadn't picked up... If only he had saved Jed's 29 messages in a single day... Ian McEwan has long been a poet of the arbitrary nightmare, his characters ineluctably swept up in others' fantasies, skidding into deepening violence, and--worst of all--becoming strangers to those who love them. Even his prose itself is a masterful and methodical exercise in defamiliarization. ButEnduring Loveand its underrated predecessor,Black Dogs, are also meditations on knowledge and perception as well as brilliant manipulations of our own expectations. By the novel's end, you will be surprisingly unafraid of hot-air balloons, but you won't be too keen on looking a stranger in the eye.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",
        "0060589280": "\"Once upon a time, there was a prostitute called Maria\"-thus begins Coelho's latest novel, a book that cannot decide whether it wants to be fairy tale or saga of sexual discovery, so ends up satisfying the demands of neither. In his dedication, bestselling Brazilian novelist Coelho (The Alchemist) tells readers that his book will deal with issues that are \"harsh, difficult, shocking,\" but neither his tame forays into S&amp;M nor his rather technical observations about female anatomy and the sad but hardly new fact that many women are dissatisfied with their sex lives will do much to shock American readers. In Maria, however, the author has created a strong, sensual young woman who grabs our sympathy from the first, as she suffers unrequited love as a child, learns a bit about sex as a teenager and, at 19, makes the ill-advised decision to leave Rio on a Swedish stranger's promise of fame and fortune. Maria's trials and triumphs-she goes from restaurant dancer to high-class prostitute-would make for an entertaining if rather prosaic novel, but Coelho, unfortunately, does not leave it there. Instead, he embarks on a philosophical exploration of sexual love, using Maria's increasingly ponderous and pseudo-philosophical diary entries as a means for expounding on the nature of sexual desire, passion and love. At the end, the story boils down to a rather predictable romance tarted up with a few sexy trappings.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Though Horowitz is a cofounder of Andreessen Horowitz and his credentials reside mainly in Silicon Valley, he&#x2019;s imparted some valuable insight on hard lessons learned that apply to any manager, whether in the executive suite or not. As with most experiential books, it is all about him&#x2014;but it&#x2019;s written in such an engaging and universally acceptable manner that no one could object. Leave aside his background, for the moment. Who would realize, for instance, that executives worry about things like initiating layoffs, hiring the right people, training, and minimizing politics, among others? It&#x2019;s a refreshingly honest take, and his colorful (and, yes, profanity-laced) language breaks down any other misperceptions about the role and the person.

But writing 30 years later, Ollestad is wise and talented enough to focus his story on the essentials, cutting elegantly back and forth between a moment-by-moment account of the crash and his memories of the difficult but often idyllic year leading up to it. More than a story of survival, it's a time-tempered reckoning with what it means to be a father and a son. --Tom NissleyAmazon Exclusive Essay:It Starts With a Good Storyby Norman OllestadIt was time for my eight-year old son, Noah, to read before bed. \"Eh,\" he groaned. \"Reading is so boring. It sucks.\" He&rsquo;d been reciting this same mantra for months. I was resting beside him in his bed and I saw his whole life crumble--a slew of poor report cards and father-son arguments, ending in long term unemployment. \"What about Dr. Seuss?\" I reasoned. He glared at me with his brown eyes. \"It's okay,\" he mumbled. I opened the book he was reading for his class and handed it to him. He stared at it, mute. \"Noah,\" I said from my lowest register. He proceeded to read at a snail's pace and I pointed out that it would take him twice as long as usual to get through the required five pages. So he ran the words together, not even stopping at periods. I grabbed the book and told him we'd be reading all weekend to make up for his lack of cooperation. For months I coerced him like that, urging him past his lazy monotone, trying to get him to connect with the story. It was a long few months.When I was Noah's age I also disliked reading. I just wanted to hear the story without having to work for it. I had wished my dad could work the same kind of magic he did with surfing: he'd push me into the waves so that I could simply enjoy the ride, eliminating the most arduous, frustrating part of surfing--paddling for the wave.My father was always asking my mother, who was a grade-school teacher, why I wasn't a better reader. She advocated patience, and encouraged me by tirelessly pointing out things in each story that I might relate to. My father was killed when I was eleven, so he never got to witness my eventual love of reading.In order to help Noah find that love, I searched for a seminal moment in my past that had transformed me. There was no single thing. But during my reminiscences I flashed on Dad reading aloud my grandparents' monthly letters from Mexico. They had retired to Puerto Vallarta and their letters were filled with stories. Stories about an inland village where Grandpa went twice a week to buy ice for their fridge, to keep their food cold. Stories about helping a Mexican family after a hurricane hit Puerto Vallarta. Stories of secret waterfalls and secluded isthmuses that Grandpa and Grandma had discovered around Vallarta. And that&rsquo;s when it hit me--it was very simple: the essence of my love for reading really emanates from my love for stories.\"How about I tell you a story tonight,\" I whispered with great zeal to Noah. His eyes lit up and he smiled. \"What kind of story?\"\"Any kind,\" I said.\"A story about a magic skateboard would be cool,\" he suggested. As I spun the impromptu tale, he rolled onto his side and stared at me, totally focused. The following night I made a bargain with him: \"First read five pages, then I'll work up a story about whatever you want.\" Before I got myself nestled beside him, he was halfway through the first page. Progressively, Noah's topics became more elaborate, and soon he was giving me outlines for stories. Somewhere along the line his reading voice changed--he was gobbling up the sentences, his voice alive with inflection. He'd broken through. Noah was hooked on stories, like I got hooked on riding waves. Once he'd experienced the pleasure of going on that narrative ride, reading became second nature, like paddling for a wave. It all starts with a good story.Photographs fromCrazy For the Storm(Click to Enlarge)My first surfboard, Topanga Beach, 1968Mom, Dad, and Me, Topanga Beach, 1968Dad in St. Anton, Austria, Early 1970'sSt. Anton with DadMe, Ski racingSkiing with DadPuerto Vallarta, 1975Three generations of Normans, 1977",
        "0060536357": "The leveraged buyout of the RJR Nabisco Corporation for $25 billion is a landmark in American business history, a story of avarice on an epic scale. Two versions of the fierce competition for the largest buyout ever consummated are presented by skilled journalists with contrasting styles. Burrough and Helyar are clearly fascinated with the personalities of the players in the deal and with the trappings of corporate wealth. The restless, flamboyant personality of Ross Johnson, CEO of RJR Nabisco, is portrayed as the key to the events that were to unfold. The colorful description of all of the players and the events will likely have broad appeal. Lampert signals the complexity of her story by introducing her narrative with a three-page cast of characters. Her focus on the strategy of the players and on the fast-paced action provides a more concise description of a deal big enough to augment the wealth of many rich people. Business libraries will want both versions of this story of capitalism drawn to the extreme, but students, looking for a more comprehensive treatment, will favor Lampert's version.- Joseph Barth, U.S. Military Acad.

Some days, Caren Gray can hardly believe she is still rooted to Belle Vie, the Louisiana plantation where she grew up, where her mother was a cook and her great-great-great-grandfather was a slave. Now the single mother to a nine-year-old daughter, she manages the showplace, which has long been owned by the prosperous Clancy family and is a popular site for weddings and banquets. Despite the beauty of the house and grounds, Caren still feels uneasy whenever she visits the former slave quarters, a stark reminder of the antebellum plantation&#x2019;s notorious past. When a cane worker is found with her throat slit, Caren is drawn into the investigation as the police target one of her employees as the murderer. Soon, though, Caren learns some rather unsavory information about the Clancy family and their nefarious dealings in both the past and the present.

        "B00030GS80": "There's always been a certain magic to Zelda games. The classic formula should have gotten old by now, but it hasn't. Perhaps it's because we all identify on some level with this shy, unlikely hero. Maybe the games remind us of our own childhood. Or perhaps these titles are consistently of such high quality that we can't help but love them. Regardless, The Minish Cap succeeds in all these ways &#x96; simultaneously embracing its links to the past while offering numerous innovations that keep gameplay fresh, exciting, and a true joy to&#xA0;play.The greatest of these novel concepts is the ability to transform from normal size down to the diminutive form of the Minish, a race of tiny people living right under the noses of the humans. This opens up entirely new realms of gameplay, as puzzles and even combat must be accomplished in different ways. When miniaturized, the smallest puddle becomes a deep lake, and the most mundane creatures become monstrous foes.There's a new item called the Gust Jar that allows you to suck up obstacles and enemies before blowing them back out in a burst of air. It's one of the cooler new power-up items I've encountered in any of the Zelda games, and adds yet another level of complexity to how you play. Another new ability allows Link to double himself, creating a ghostly after-image that mirrors his moves for a brief time. As you might imagine, this results in some clever and unique brainteasers that are a nod to the recent Four Swords games. In all these ways, the game challenges you to think in multiple dimensions and carefully remember details on your journey. A large cast of characters fleshes out the land of Hyrule, and monsters both large and small await your blade. To further connect you to the world's people, you will now collect items called Kinstones &#x96; broken halves of coin-like objects that can be fused with the Kinstones that other characters in the world have collected. By doing so, you'll open up portals, treasure chests, and secret doors all over the map. It's an addictive side quest that serves as a worthy compliment to the main adventure.One of my few complaints is that while the puzzles in the game are uniformly challenging, some of the combat is easier than I might have liked, especially against the bosses, who were often one-trick ponies requiring minimal skill. Even so, the fights are satisfying in their simplicity, and you have access to all the familiar weapons and techniques, including the boomerang, spin attack, and bow. The old and new features combine to make a game that feels both true to the Zelda heritage while offering an entirely unique experience.But more than any of this, the game charms you with its stalwart hero. This silent little boy with ruffled, messy hair is faced with seemingly insurmountable odds. Through him, the game establishes a hero whose pure heart and will are carrying him forward. All the elements of The Minish Cap (even its presence on the GBA) contribute to the idea of a tiny force for good that strives to triumph against a huge evil. It's a classic adventure that more than lives up to the legacy of a classic series.Concept:The time-honored Zelda tale retold in yet another new formGraphics:Mixing the familiar images of previous Zelda games with humorous and detailed new character designs results in an impressive success for the GBASound:Some of the most memorable and recognizable tunes in gaming sound great even on those little GBA speakersPlayability:Responsive and flexible with a nearly perfect learning curve that moves from simple to challengingEntertainment:Like many of its predecessors &#x96; a true classicReplay:ModerateRated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Matt MillerIssue:February 20052nd Opinion:There's a bird sitting on my head, I'm no larger than a toenail clipping, and I've been stuck on the same puzzle for the last three hours.

This is classic Zelda gameplay in all its glory. The journey is a tad easy for my liking (boss fights are a breeze), but I can't get enough of the creative puzzles and new gadgets. Shrinking in height to a two-pixel speck is not only hilarious, it's one of the most compelling concepts that the series has offered up in a long time. Minigames are also in great abundance, and you can collect over 130 different figurines that shed some light on the characters in the world (which also happens to be one of my favorite aspects of Wind Waker). From its stunning visuals to its gameplay finesse, The Minish Cap is another harrowing Hyrule adventure that you'll remember for a lifetime.Rated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer",

All do, however, have motives for murder: the smarmy fellow has personally humiliated successful Felicia Redmon, professionally backstabbed not-so-successful Tallie Blankenship and plagiarized the plot of a book that means the world to ambitious Jan Glass. So confessing that they were the last to see their tormentor alive is likely to make them prime suspects, even in the eyes of Tallie's protective new cop boyfriend. But if they stay silent, they may wind up being the real murderer's next victims. While whodunit isn't revealed till the book's surprise ending, the suspense isn't the kind that kills you. As is typical of Bond's books (Party Crashers,etc.), the overall tone is deliciously frothy, and small comedic details abound: high-powered Felicia is a secret super housewife who cleans, cooks and lies about it, and Jan has changed her name from plain \"Jane\" to appear more glamorously French.

        "B0002CHJAA": "Imagine if Peter Jackson, instead of continuing his The Lord of the Rings epic in movie form, had decided to tell the story of The Two Towers through limited edition Bazooka Joe comics. The characters would all be there and the concepts behind the story would still be intriguing, but the delivery and execution would be devoid of grace or subtlety. If you're having trouble picturing that, just pick up a copy of Xenosaga Episode II and you will understand all too well. Despite my undying adoration of the first entry, I am sorry to report that this game is a dropped ball of Devil May Cry&nbsp;2&nbsp;proportions.Let's get one thing straight: This is not a bad RPG. It is, however, utterly disappointing in its mediocrity. Even ignoring the radiance of its predecessor, this game features some baffling design choices that seem specifically intended to make it frustrating. It contains a meager 25-hour critical path (one of the dungeons is even repeated!), jarring load times before each fight, and an absence of money or shops that leaves you with a constant shortage of necessary recovery items. I'm not against titles breaking from conventions, but these are some of the worst decisions outside of Charles Grodin's&nbsp;resume.Unfortunately, the area where Episode II has received the greatest attention is also where it falters the most. It sports a redesigned battle system that focuses much more on combined efforts rather than individual abilities. By stocking extra attacks and using the shared Boost gauge, the party can cooperatively unleash devastating combos. First you attack a sequence of zones on an enemy (which breaks its defense), then boost other characters into the action queue so they can take advantage of the weakened foe. Unfortunately, this method quickly becomes the only viable way to inflict damage on any enemy; whether it's a simple encounter or key boss fight, every battle is a pathetic routine of eating attacks as you build up your various gauges in preparation for the big assault.My favorite thing about the first Xenosaga was the way it systematically gave the finger to anyone who didn't devote themselves, body and soul, to taking in the whole experience. \"Oh, you don't want to watch the plot or figure out the skill system?\" the game seemed to say, \"Well toughen up, buttercup. It's a long ride.\" On the other hand, Episode II appears to be aimed squarely at the milquetoasts who couldn't handle the previous iteration, coddling and cooing \"Do you want a lolly, sweetheart?\" Where the series' balance (or imbalance) between story and action was once the subject of criticism, the frequency of amazing cutscenes is now all that redeems Episode II.Concept:Give loyal fans more philosophical puzzle pieces, but make them suffer along the wayGraphics:Despite some jaggies and Shion's new \"bus station skank\" style, it is a sleek and beautiful gameSound:The voice actor switch-ups are unfortunate (especially KOS-MOS), and the soundtrack frequently jumps between awe-inspiring and comically inappropriatePlayability:Increased accessibility comes at the expense of engaging customizationEntertainment:The ratio of \"pay attention time\" to \"play time\" is still uneven, but the action cutscenes rank among the very best in gamingReplay:Moderately HighRated:7.75 out of 10Editor:Joe JubaIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:I wish I had better news to share. But facts are facts, and the follow up to one of my favorite RPGs is a disappointment on many levels. Graphics, story, and jaw-dropping cinematics are thankfully not on the list of casualties &#8211; those remain truly top notch as they combine to exhibit expressive characters wrestling with interweaving themes of family, betrayal, and the nature of evil. It's too bad gameplay fails to be even remotely as complex. Combat is desperately shallow, especially in the lengthy mech sequences that show up in the second half of the time. The game-spanning series of side quests are contrived and drab, but you're forced to endure them to get some of the better power-ups. And when I started encountering frequent inane box puzzles, I nearly threw up my hands in existential, angst-ridden despair. The whole affair seems amateurish in comparison to the intricate original. So do I think Episode II has a lot of problems? Yes. Will it disappoint you as it did me? Probably. But if you're a fan of the original, do I still think you should play this one? As much as it's going to hurt &#8211; definitely.Rated:7.5 out of 10Editor:Matt MillerSubscribe to Game Informer--Amazon.com",

        "0060188707": "There would seem to be little reason for yet another translation of Don Quixote. Translated into English some 20 times since the novel appeared in two parts in 1605 and 1615, and at least five times in the last half-century, it is currently available in multiple editions (the most recent is the 1999 Norton Critical Edition translated by Burton Raffel). Yet Grossman bravely attempts a fresh rendition of the adventures of the intrepid knight Don Quixote and his humble squire Sancho Panza. As the respected translator of many of Latin America's finest writers (among them Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Carlos Fuentes and Mario Vargas Llosa), she is well suited to the task, and her translation is admirably readable and consistent while managing to retain the vigor, sly humor and colloquial playfulness of the Spanish. Erring on the side of the literal, she isn't afraid to turn out clunky sentences; what she loses in smoothness and elegance she gains in vitality. The text is free of archaisms the contemporary reader will rarely stumble over a word and the footnotes (though rather erratically supplied) are generally helpful. Her version easily bests Raffel's ambitious but eccentric and uneven effort, and though it may not immediately supplant standard translations by J.M. Cohen, Samuel Putnam and Walter Starkie, it should give them a run for their money. Against the odds, Grossman has given us an honest, robust and freshly revelatory Quixote for our times.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Now she rules at his side as Abhorsen, the  sole necromancer of the Old Kingdom, keeping the people safe from the dark power  of Free Magic. But this is not just Sabriel's tale. It is also the story of  Hedge, a mysterious necromancer who is digging up a monstrous evil that could  utterly destroy the Old Kingdom.

        "B003VJNPPE": "In BriefThe second instalment in the RPG saga about the Witcher, Geralt of Rivia, features a thoroughly engrossing, mature storyline defining new standards for thought-provoking, non-linear game narration. In addition to an epic story, the game features an original, brutal combat system that uniquely combines tactical elements with dynamic action. A new, modern game engine, responsible both for beautiful visuals and sophisticated game mechanics puts players in the most lively and believable world ever created in an RPG game. A captivating story, dynamic combat system, beautiful graphics, and everything else that made the original Witcher such a great game are now executed in a much more advanced and sophisticated way.DEVELOPER: CD Projekt REDBrief Story DescriptionAfter helping to stop the rebellion undertaken by the Order of the Flaming Rose and saving King Foltest&rsquo;s life, Geralt became one of the central figures of political turmoil in the Kingdom of Temeria. Geralt continues to protect the King in the monarch&rsquo;s mission to bring peace to his state. The last bastions of the Order yielded to the royal army. The only remaining task is to pacify the rebellious castle of Baroness La Valette, who announced separation from the Kingdom. It&rsquo;s been a month since the attempted assassination of the king, when his army arrives at the gates of Baroness La Valette&rsquo;s fortress in preparation for the final battle. In the meantime, Geralt, stuck with Foltest, cannot begin his personal quest - to discover the origin and identity of the mysterious witcher-like assassin responsible for the attempt on the king&rsquo;s life - a quest that would answer many questions...Key FeaturesA truly epic, intense, emotionally charged adventure with non-linear game narration. Three independent plot lines with several alternative events are dependent on the player&rsquo;s choices and lead to multiple different game endings and several additional plot forks.

We investigate the assassinations of the rulers of the Northern Kingdoms and follow Geralt&rsquo;s personal theme, in which he&rsquo;s looking for his own identity. Gradually we learn how powerful forces influence our situation and what role they order us to play.Rich, mature dialogue as found in Andrzej Sapkowski&rsquo;s book series and The Witcher 1, presented in highly filmic cutscenes and dialogues sequences, thanks to a new game engine.New, improved system of flashbacks. Now the reminiscences of Geralt, in which we observe the link between our past choices with current actions, are realistically and smoothly woven into the gameplay.Sex and eroticism will be introduced in a much more realistic, involving and mature way, thanks to which sexual relationships are presented more credibly than in TW1.Unique, deep, consistent and rich game world established in a series of best-selling books by A. Sapkowski and recreated in the game to provide an incredible, believable story-driven experience.Believable, true-to-life characters with their own motivations and goals. During our journey we meet ordinary men, soldiers, rebels, powerful mages, rulers and their assassins. Depending on our decisions we meet different game characters, and our relationships shape further actions in the game.Highly varied, breathtaking locations, which thanks to the new engine create a cohesive, fully accessible world!Rich, living world in which every character has their own way of life and unique occupations. Our actions modify the relationship with the game-world population and, in the case of the main plot line, open or close the possibilities of interaction with the game world.Greater freedom of exploration to provide increased game realism and a wider range of new tactical options.

First taken as a slave along with his less intrepid brother, Eli assimilates himself into Comanche culture, learning their arts of riding, hunting, and total warfare. When the tribe succumbs to waves of disease and settlers, Eli's only option is a return to Texas, where his acquired thirsts for freedom and self-determination set a course for his family's inexorable rise through the industries of cattle and oil.The Sonis Philipp Meyer's epic tale of more than 150 years of money, family, and power, told through the memories of three unforgettable narrators: Eli, now 100 and known simply as \"the Colonel\"; Eli's son Peter, called \"the great disappointment\" for his failure to meet the family&rsquo;s vision of itself; and Eli's great-granddaughter Jeanne Anne, who struggles to maintain the McCullough empire in the economic frontier of modern Texas. The book is long but never dull&mdash;Meyer's gift (and obsession) for historical detail and vernacular is revelatory, and the distinct voices of his fully fleshed-and-blooded characters drive the story. And let there be blood: some readers will flinch at Meyer's blunt (and often mesmerizing) portrayal of violence in mid-19th century Texas, but it&rsquo;s never gratuitous. His first novel, 2009'sAmerican Rust, drew praise for its stark and original characterization of post-industrial America, but Meyer has outdone himself withThe Son, as ambitious a book as any you&rsquo;ll read this year--or any year. Early reviewers call it a masterpiece, and while it's easy to dismiss so many raves as hyperbole,The Sonis an extraordinary achievement.--Jon Foro",
        "0060565233": "HistorianDouglas Brinkley's insightfulTour of Dutycovers John Kerry's heroic Vietnam service (where he won the Silver and Bronze Stars and three Purple Hearts) and the fervent antiwar campaign it eventually spawned. Born to Boston Brahmin heritage, the son of an American diplomat, John Forbes Kerry was a child of good fortune--an eventual Yalie whose personal hero (John Fitzgerald Kennedy) shared his initials. However, Kerry's privileged upbringing instilled in him not a sense of entitlement, but a burning sense of public service. Though equally obsessed and revulsed by the burgeoning Vietnam conflict, Kerry's sense of duty led him to enlist in the Navy (after graduating Yale), and then volunteer for training as captain of a Swift boat (small aluminum vessels that patrolled the coastal waters and narrow, dangerous tributaries of Vietnam's massive Mekong delta). Brinkley's meticulous research relies on Kerry's detailed wartime diaries, logs, and interviews, (published here for the first time) as well as a wealth of accounts of the Navy's first extensive \"brown water\" riverine campaign since the Civil War. Those harrowing months only deepened Kerry's antipathy to the war, and he returned to become one of the most articulate leaders of the Vietnam Veterans Against the War. Brinkley's account gives crucial human dimensions to a man whose seeming aloofness has long plagued him. With Americans again dying in a controversial war halfway around the world, one cannot help but wonder if Kerry will yet again be able to pose the haunting question first put to a Congressional panel thirty years ago: \"How do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake?\"--Jerry McCulley",

        "B00002DHEV": "Nintendo first dabbled in video games during the industry's early years of the mid-'70s. Generations of successful gaming console releases through the years led to the much-hyped 1996 launch of Nintendo 64, a system that represented a giant evolutionary leap in video game technology. Within the first three days of launch, hundreds of thousands of gamers hunkered down withMario 64, considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever created. Even today, the system's excellent design continues to host an ever-expanding library of breakthrough games.Nintendo 64's popularity among younger gamers is no surprise. Well-respected games featuring such long-lived and much-loved personalities as Mario (of arcade classicDonkey Kongfame), Zelda, andBanjo-Kazooieare easy to learn and offer enormous replay value. But times are a' changin' and the system's ever-growing library of titles has expanded into every genre of games imaginable, including games better-suited for older gamers. In fact, some of the most acclaimed--in some cases, groundbreaking--games available on any platform today are packed onto N64's old-school cartridges.Under the system's hood, its appeal to the young certainly didn't produce a less mature gaming machine. On the contrary, the 64-bit system boasts impressive graphics, stereo sound, and numerous accessory enhancements, including a high-resolution pack that boosts graphics to awe-inspiring resolutions.Start your library withGoldeneye 007,Mario 64,Banjo Kazooie,Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, andStar Wars: Episode One Racer--these titles represent a decent start to any N64 cartridge library.With the recent launch of Sega's Dreamcast system, Nintendo 64 is being left behind as the leader in video game technology. And with newer game systems featuring CD-based games, the system's expensive cartridge format is proving itself an archaic and unconventional storage format. But, at a sub-$100 recommended retail price, innovative accessory enhancements and a great library of games keep the system's rabid fan base satisfied, if not eager for Nintendo's next evolutionary step.--Eric Twelker",

The proprietor of a caf&eacute; in a rustic village, this crabby old lady recalls the days of her childhood, which coincided with the German occupation.

This intrigue provided a distraction from their grim home life--their father was killed in the war and their mother was a secretive, troubled woman.

To the children, of course, these were mere abstractions: \"We understood so little of it. Least of all the Resistance, that fabulous quasi-organization.

Dennis, who quickly learned how to trade after starting as a runner at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in 1966 at age 17, had made a reported $200 million by 1983. To settle an argument with fellow trader William Eckhardt about whether trading ability was innate or could be taught, he put an ad in theWall Street Journaloffering to teach candidates how to trade in two weeks, and then backed them with his own money. Of the thousands of people who who applied, 23 turtles were accepted. Their trading made $100 million for Dennis, leading some to become highly successful traders in their own right. Having tracked down most of the people involved, Covel describes the turtle training, including rules for entering and exiting trades as well as Dennis and Eckhardt's personal lessons, and speculates on why some turtles succeeded more than others. However, there are too many characters with competing interests, and many missing facts. Covel's own strong views can also get more emphasis than the voices of the principals. Still, the book is a useful training manual distilling the lessons of a fascinating experiment.(Oct.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Her little sister, Libby, who is slightly mad, stores her \"pooey knickers\" and  her scuba-diving Barbie doll in Georgia's bed. Her mother (from whom she  inherited her orangutan eyebrow gene and possibly her \"gigantic basoomas\") is  clearly inhabiting Earth solely to make her life miserable, and even her best  friend Jas is \"half girl, half turnip.\"Despite the fact that she's spared from going to \"Kiwi-a-gogo land,\" things  don't get much better for Georgia. She's suspended for a childish prank right  before her dad returns from New Zealand, she falls in love with the SG who dumps  her for being too young, and Dave, the \"red-herring\" boyfriend she's using to  make the SG jealous calls her a \"heartless whatsit.\" And, she continues, \"the  spot on my bum is probably a boil.

He decides to attend Harvard University to study English. During his studies, he rankles under his writing professors' criticism. As an act of rebellion, Crichton submits an essay by George Orwell as his own. The professor doesn&#x92;t catch the plagiarism and gives Orwell a B-. This experience convinces Crichton to change his field of study to anthropology.1964:Crichton graduates summa cum laude from Harvard University in anthropology. After studying further as a visiting lecturer at Cambridge University and receiving the Henry Russell Shaw Travelling Fellowship, which allowed him to travel in Europe and North Africa, Crichton begins coursework at the Harvard School of Medicine. To help fund his medical endeavors, he writes spy thrillers under several pen names. One of these works,A Case of Need, wins the 1968 Mystery Writers of America's Edgar Allan Poe Award.1969:Crichton graduates from Harvard Medical school and is accepted as a post-doctoral fellow at the Salk Institute for Biological Science in La Jolla, Calif. However, his career in medicine is waylaid by the publication of the first novel under his own name,The Andromeda Strain. The novel, about an apocalyptic plague, climbs high on bestseller lists and is later made into apopular film. Crichton said of his decision to pursue writing full time: \"To quit medicine to become a writer struck most people like quitting the Supreme Court to become a bail bondsman.\"1972:Crichton's second novel under his own nameThe Terminal Man, is published. Also, two of Crichton's previous works under his pen names,DealingandA Case of Needare made into movies. After watching the filming, Crichton decides to try his hand at directing. He will eventually direct seven films including the 1973 science-fiction hitWestworld, which was the first film ever to use computer-generated effects.1980:Crichton draws on his anthropology background and fascination with new technology to createCongo, a best-selling novel about a search for industrial diamonds and a new race of gorillas. The novel, patterned after the adventure writings of H. Ryder Haggard, updates the genre with the inclusion of high-tech gadgets that, although may seem quaint 20 years later, serve to set Crichton's work apart and he begins to cement his reputation as \"the father of the techno-thriller.\"1990:After the 1980s, which saw the publication of the underwater adventureSphere(1987) and an invitation to become a visiting writer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1988), Crichton begins the new decade with a bang via the publication of his most popular novel,Jurassic Park. The book is a powerful example of Crichton's use of science and technology as the bedrock for his work. Heady discussion of genetic engineering, chaos theory, and paleontology run throughout the tightly-wound thriller that strands a crew of scientists on an island populated by cloned dinosaurs run amok. The novel inspires the 1993Steven Spielberg film, and together book and film will re-ignite the world&#x92;s fascination with dinosaurs.1995:Crichton resurrects an idea from his medical school days to create the Emmy-Award Winning television seriesER. In this year,ERwon eight Emmys and Crichton received an award from the Producers Guild of America in the category of outstanding multi-episodic series. Set in an insanely busy an often dangerous Chicago emergency room, the fast-paced drama is defined by Crichton's now trademark use of technical expertise and insider jargon. The year also saw the publication ofThe Lost Worldreturning readers to the dinosaur-infested island.2000:In recognition for Crichton's contribution in popularizing paleontology, a dinosaur discovered in southern China is named after him. \"Crichton's ankylosaur\" is a small, armored plant-eating dinosaur that dates to the early Jurassic Period, about 180 million years ago. \"For a person like me, this is much better than an Academy Award,\" Crichton said of the honor.2004:Crichton&#x92;s newest thrillerState of Fearis published.Amazon.com's Significant SevenMichael Crichton kindly agreed to take the life quiz we like to give to all our authors: the Amazon.com Significant Seven.Q:What book has had the most significant impact on your life?A:Prisoners of Childhoodby Alice MillerQ:You are stranded on a desert island with only one book, one CD, and one DVD--what are they?A:Tao Te Chingby Lao Tzu (Witter Bynner version)Symphony #2 in D Majorby Johannes Brahms (Georg Solti)Ikiruby Akira KurosawaQ:What is the worst lie you've ever told?A:Surely you're joking.Q:Describe the perfect writing environment.A:Small room.

        "B00006GSNX": "Forget aboutSuper Mario Sunshine--this is the real superstar platform action game of the season. Featuring a pair of wacky robots in a quest to save the universe,Ratchet and Clankmay offer the same old basic platform scenario--run around, elude or destroy enemies, jump, and negotiate treacherously dynamic environments--but it has a number of things going for it that place it among the best titles ever in this genre.The feature that will strike you first is the terrific art direction. Set in a science fiction future, the game has a beautifully executed retro cartoon look (think old Warner Bros.). The attention lavished on every detail, from architecture to character design, makes for a world that feels complete and real. This extends to the cutscenes, which feature a variety of colorful characters given vivid life with excellent voice acting. Then there is the sheer size and level of interactivity of the environments. For me, a particularly stunning moment was when my character was knocked off a skyscraper, but instead of perishing, landed on a ledge and was able to seamlessly navigate to a whole separate section of the game. Another moment of truth came when I aimed my blaster at one of the vehicles whizzing by in the sky. These vehicles were just pretty wallpaper, I thought, but no, the thing blew up. In fact, nearly everything you see is destructible or responsive in some way: you can jump up trees, scuttle over walkways, smash boxes, and climb up ledges. And the control scheme is just complex enough to keep things interesting with multiple weapons and the like, without being bogged down by too many features.While the routine of finding and destroying enemy robots may get tedious after a while,Ratchet and Clankkeeps things interesting with the many metamorphoses of Clank (who takes on forms that surprise even himself), cool weapons like the Glove of Doom (which unleashes armies of tiny Clanks), and shifting first-robot, third-robot points of view.If this game doesn't become the bestselling platform action game of the year, it will prove that nostalgia for old characters, marketing hype, and brand loyalty really are more important than quality.--David Stoesz",
        "0061702587": "Product DescriptionBlending history and anecdote, geography and reminiscence, science and exposition, theNew York Timesbestselling author ofKrakatoatells the breathtaking saga of the magnificent Atlantic Ocean, setting it against the backdrop of mankind's intellectual evolution.Until a thousand years ago, no humans ventured into the Atlantic or imagined traversing its vast infinity. But once the first daring mariners successfully navigated to far shores&#x2014;whether it was the Vikings, the Irish, the Chinese, Christopher Columbus in the north, or the Portuguese and the Spanish in the south&#x2014;the Atlantic evolved in the world's growing consciousness of itself as an enclosed body of water bounded by the Americas to the West, and by Europe and Africa to the East.Atlanticis a biography of this immense space, of a sea which has defined and determined so much about the lives of the millions who live beside or near its tens of thousands of miles of coast.The Atlantic has been central to the ambitions of explorers, scientists and warriors, and it continues to affect our character, attitudes, and dreams. Poets to potentates, seers to sailors, fishermen to foresters&#x2014;all have a relationship with this great body of blue-green sea and regard her as friend or foe, adversary or ally, depending on circumstance or fortune. Simon Winchester chronicles that relationship, making the Atlantic come vividly alive. Spanning from the earth's geological origins to the age of exploration, World War II battles to modern pollution, his narrative is epic and awe-inspiring.A Q&amp;A with Author Simon WinchesterQ:Writing a &#x201C;biography&#x201D; of a massive subject like the Atlantic Ocean is audacious and seemingly daunting. What inspired you to write the book, how long did it take you, and what did your research entail?Winchester:It occurred to me one afternoon while, for the umpteenth time, I was crossing &#x2018;the pond&#x2019; on a flight between London and New York, that we took the waters below us far too much for granted. I thought back to the first crossing I had ever made, back in 1963, on a ship&#x2014;and the romance of the ocean as I saw it then&#x2014;and I decided that it could be very interesting to look into the role the Atlantic has played in humankind&#x2019;s history. I spent the next eighteen months travelling, going everywhere from the Faroes and Iceland in the north, to Tristan da Cunha and Patagonia in the south. The book itself took eight months to write, four to edit.Q:What was the most unusual or fascinating fact you discovered while researching and writingAtlantic?Winchester:I remain intrigued by the thought that the State of Israel was in effect born as a result of a lack of cordite in the Royal Navy&#x2019;s ammunition stores during the Battle of the Atlantic in 1916.  A White Russian biologist, Chaim Weizmann, at the time a professor at the University of Manchester, worked out how to solve this problem, and when the British government of the time offered to reward him for his game-changing invention, he declined&#x2014;asking only for Arthur Balfour to make his famous Declaration of 1917, which led to the formation of Israel.Q:Why is the Atlantic significant in the development of Western civilization? Is there one important thing about the ocean we should know but do not?Winchester:The first true parliamentary democracy was founded in the Atlantic, in Iceland in the tenth century&#x2014;and the concept spread rapidly through northern Europe. It was then followed in short order by the establishment of a similarly organized network of traders and trade routes, the so-called Hanseatic leaguers. That two such crucial aspects of modern human civilization&#x2014;government and trade&#x2014;are based still today on principles laid down beside the Atlantic Ocean is a fact little remembered by most &#x2014;and when I found the story out, it astonished and delighted me.Q:You are a sailor yourself. Have you sailed the Atlantic? What was the experience like?Winchester:I have sailed the entire Indian Ocean; and I have sailed a little in the South Atlantic&#x2014;undertaking the voyage in a tiny (30ft) steel gaff-rigged schooner.  But while I had few major problems sailing between the coasts of India and South Africa, once I had &#x2018;rounded the bend&#x2019;, as it were, and passed into the Atlantic, everything changed: the sea became very rough and (a particular problem in a steel yacht) very cold.  And so I abandoned the Atlantic attempt&#x2014;a decision that gives me ever greater respect today for the ocean itself, and for those sailors who are brave and determined enough to sail it. (In my defense&#x2014;since 16 year olds now make the journey&#x2014;I should point out that I went out without radio or radar, and with only a sextant as a navigation aid. GPS and e-mail make modern yachting a somewhat less arduous business. But the inescapable fact that I wiped out troubles me still. A bit.)Q:How do today&#x2019;s giant cruise ships compare to their predecessors like the Queen Mary or the Titanic? Have we lost something fundamental in how we experience the ocean with modernization?Winchester:I detest the big cruise ships of today, immense Vegas style monstrosities filled with amusements specifically designed&#x2014;or so it seems&#x2014;utterly to detach the passenger from the realities of the ocean he is crossing (and to make even more money for the shipowners, of course). One surely goes to sea to experience the sea, it seems to me&#x2014;and if you are in a gigantic floating play-center, and one that barely moves with the waves, then why not just stay home, and in doing so burn less fuel and pollute the world a little less?Q:Is it possible for 21st century humans to regain a sense of awe and respect for this magnificent natural wonder? What might it take for us to do so?Winchester:It is my fond hope that just a few good people who may read and like this book will stop for a moment, and perhaps then begin to think about and regard the ocean in a different way. And then maybe go down to the shore and look at it, and consider some of its wonders. And then, most importantly, tell the next generation that this body of water, like all the great oceanic bodies of water on the planet, is a rare and precious entity deserving of our care and our respect.  I realize this may be no more than wishful thinking: but after writing this book I have come to feel a very powerful connection with the Atlantic Ocean, and I so very much want others to look at it in the same way.Q:How does the Atlantic compare to other oceans? What makes it special/unique?Winchester:Of the world&#x2019;s great oceans the Atlantic is not the biggest; it is not the prettiest; it is not the most benign. But it does possess the greatest concentration of the marker-events of human history. And if, as seems unarguable, the Mediterranean could once fairly be said to have been the inland sea of classical civilization, then surely the Atlantic Ocean, by virtue of this huge concentration of ideas, events, inventions and developments, has become, and unarguably also, the inland sea of modern civilization. No other ocean comes close to filling this role &#x2013; which is why the Atlantic rises, head and shoulders, above all of its taller, prettier and calmer maritime cousins.",
        "0061727660": "Alexander McCall Smith Talks with Jacqueline WinspearAlexander McCall Smith: Characters, once created, have a way of staying on. Maisie is an attractive character--when did she say to you: \"I want a series?\"Jacqueline Winspear: As I was writing the first novel in the series,Maisie Dobbs, I realized that scenes and ideas were coming to me that were not part of the book. I started keeping notes on those other scenes, passages of dialogue and so on, and when I had finishedMaisie Dobbs, I went through those notes and realized I had rough plans for another five or six books. Indeed, as I was writing the second book in the series,Birds of a Feather, I really had to push any thoughts of the intended third novel from my mind, so strong were the images forPardonable Liesthat kept popping into my mind's eye. I had to be very disciplined not to be distracted by those images--it was rather like being nagged by one's own characters.&nbsp;Smith: Maisie Dobbs is firmly placed in the past. Would you be comfortable writing about contemporary Britain?Winspear: That&rsquo;s a very good question, and indeed, I have a more contemporary novel on the proverbial \"back-burner.\"&nbsp; However, although I visit my parents in Sussex many several times each year, for me there is a certain detachment from everyday life in the UK. I am not as familiar with various aspects of life there, so it might be difficult to get that ring of authenticity.&nbsp; On the other hand, one could argue that the lack of transparency could act in my favor, because I now take notice of so many things that might have passed me by.&nbsp; I believe one of the reasons I am so comfortable writing about the past is that when I was a child we lived in a small hamlet with very few children, so it was a world of adults, many of them elderly, and all of them ready to tell a story of their own youth.I have always been drawn to the past through family history, a curiosity that has its roots in my grandfather's experience in the Great War--he was wounded and shell-shocked at the Battle of the Somme in 1916. Even as a very young child I understood the extent of his suffering and struggled to fathom how something so terrible could happen to a beloved grandparent.&nbsp; And I am sure my interest in the women of that generation--the first generation of women to go to war in modern times--is rooted in memories of the ladies of a certain age who lived in our neighborhood as I was growing up. They were typical of that generation, very independent women who had remained single due to circumstance, for the men they might have married had been lost to war.So, to the question of writing about contemporary Britain--I think I'll find out more about my level of comfort with modern times when I pull that contemporary novel off the back burner. In the meantime, there's so much that I want to explore from the past, though when I immerse myself in the preparatory research for my books, I am always reminded of the old adage: \"history repeats itself.\"Smith: You and I both started as novelists rather later than is perhaps usual. Is that a good thing or a bad thing?Winspear: When I was sixteen I rather precociously announced that I would write my first novel by the time I was thirty--it seemed such a formidable age of adulthood, I suppose. Of course, thirty came and went with no novel to show for it, and in the meantime I was becoming more and more interested in nonfiction writing.&nbsp; I was in my late thirties by the time I made a real commitment to getting my work published, and I concentrated more on essays, articles and other creative nonfiction. I believe my writing at that time represented something of an apprenticeship in that I was really working at the craft of writing, of building my understanding of framing a scene, of bringing the reader along with metaphor, and with developing scenes that were something like the literary equivalent of a zoom lens on the camera; I was trying to find out what worked in terms of drawing the reader in and placing them at the center of the action. Though I had no plans to write a novel until the idea forMaisie Dobbsactually came to me, upon reflection it seems as if I had been preparing for the task with my literary cross-training in the same way that an athlete prepares for the big event.&nbsp;I believe the journey to becoming a writer is one that is very personal to the individual and is neither good or bad--it's just what it is. There are times when I think it would have been so much more fun to have started writing fiction earlier, but had that happened, the stars might not have aligned to bring the character of Maisie Dobbs into my life.&nbsp; And I think that in embarking upon being novelists in our middle years, we&rsquo;ve probably both brought something to our work that we might not have been able to offer in younger days, either due to other responsibilities, or simply who we were at the time (though having said that, I am sure your readers wish the wonderful Precious Ramotswe had been created many years before you decided to writeThe No 1 Ladies' Detective Agency!)Smith: Have you written anything about Maisie that you would like to unwrite?Winspear: No, not at all, although I should add that I have never gone back and re-read any of my books, a prospect I find rather daunting.&nbsp; Of course, I dip back into the books to check a point here and there, but I have never read the books from beginning to end--if I had done so, I might have a whole list of things that cause me to shudder.Smith: Do you think that transplanting oneself--in your case from the UK to California--helps one as a writer?Winspear: Another very good question!&nbsp; Many years ago, during a visit to New York, I went along to an exhibit at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue--it was called \"Writers in Exile.\"&nbsp; The focus was on writers who lived in a place other than the land of their birth, \"by will, or by compunction.\" I spent ages going around the exhibit taking copious notes, and remember it left me with a real sense of the power of being transplanted, whether by one&rsquo;s own choice, or by circumstance; and I have to say, I often think of it when people ask me if being here in California contributes to my work as a writer--and it does. To give an example, I can immerse myself in the time and place about which I write--Britain from the Great War on up to the 1930s--and I am not distracted by British life as it is today. Yes, of course, there is contemporary life here in California, but it is different (the way people speak, interact, shop, travel, work, etc.) so I can draw a firm line between life here and the world about which I write.&nbsp; I should confess that one of my recent challenges came when I started writingThe Mapping of Love and Death. The opening is set in California in 1914, so I had to ensure that my knowledge of that region today did not seep into the story. To that end I immersed myself in old books about the region, and managed to procure some vintage photographs to pin on the wall so that the past was very much with me as I wrote.When I write, the time and place of my imagination becomes very distilled, very sharp in my mind's eye. In terms of the series featuring Maisie Dobbs, it has definitely helped to be living here; when I sit down at my desk to write, I step from my world into her world, and I&rsquo;m aware of nothing else until I stop writing.&nbsp; And when I drag myself back from a morning spent in the smog-enveloped London of the 1930s, it's not bad to be able to walk outside into the garden and warm my bones in the California sun for a while.",

As the anniversary of the battle approaches, ancient politics and the present-day murder cause tensions between the trolls and dwarfs to boil. Though Koom Valley was a disaster for both sides, certain community leaders from each side have been spoiling for a rematch&mdash;something Vimes is duty-bound to prevent. In the midst of this, a push toward affirmative action forces Vimes to hire a vampire named Sally to the Watch. She's sworn off human blood, but that's cold comfort to the assortment of humans, dwarfs, trolls, werewolves and golems that make up the police force. Vimes and his motley crew of coppers are called upon to not only find the murderer and keep the peace but also, in a jab atThe Da Vinci Code, solve the riddle of a painting that reputedly holds the secret to what really happened at Koom Valley. Pratchett's fantastic imagination and satirical wit are on full display.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

But she soon discovers that her cousins, the glamorous Lola and the twin boys Jackson and Pierrot, aren't up to the task, and directorial ambitions are abandoned as more interesting prospects of preoccupation come onto the scene. The charlady's son, Robbie Turner, appears to be forcing Briony's sister Cecilia to strip in the fountain and sends her obscene letters; Leon has brought home a dim chocolate magnate keen for a war to promote his new \"Army Ammo\" chocolate bar; and upstairs, Briony's migraine-stricken mother Emily keeps tabs on the house from her bed. Soon, secrets emerge that change the lives of everyone present....The interwar, upper-middle-class setting of the book's long, masterfully sustained opening section might recall Virginia Woolf or Henry Green, but as we move forward--eventually to the turn of the 21st century--the novel's central concerns emerge, and McEwan's voice becomes clear, even personal.

Kendra Osborne, a 40-year-old woman with modest ambitions and plans to achieve them, has no idea how to cope when her mother \"dumps\" her sister's three children on her doorstep and heads for Jamaica. Fifteen-year-old Ness, 11-year-old Joel and seven-year-old Toby each have a wealth of problems exacerbated by their mixed-race heritage.

        "0060574534": "Smith has clearly taken lessons from a few successful writers of chick lit (\"Days Without Sex: 0\"), but his boy version of Bridget Jones lacks the key ingredient: a sympathetic protagonist. Tom Farrell, 32, lives in Manhattan and works at a publication called Tabloid (a dead ringer for the New York Post), which proudly proclaims itself to be \"America's loudest newspaper.\" Farrell's job is that of \"rewrite man,\" redoing stories by shaping them into salacious shorts and then coming up with eye-catching headlines. As he puts it, however, his \"most time-consuming hobby is collecting ex-girlfriends,\" and the novel-which chronicles five months in Farrell's life-is mostly a jumbled catalogue of his failed love affairs. There's Julia, a co-worker Farrell can't get out of his head; Bran, a platonic friend he might try to get into his bed; Katie, a budding lawyer; and Liesl, an earnest German paralegal. Smith, the book and music review editor at People magazine, writes in glossy and accessible magazine prose (Farrell describes a co-worker as \"a girl whose hotitude was... off the charts\") and his New York patter can be clever. Searching for its place somewhere between Nick Hornby in subject matter and David Sedaris in its wit, this novel rests uneasily between the two. Publishing and journalism insiders will enjoy Smith's spot-on description of the tabloid life, but women looking for insights into the male psyche, the real potential readership here, may not take kindly to Smith's unflattering dissection of his dates. Still, this is a lively, promising debut.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.",

Tara's perfectly  horrible, freeloading boyfriend Thomas watches her diet like a hawk and remarks  cruelly on the size of her posterior, comparing her unfavorably to younger,  thinner women. Katherine is a professional success, but her personal life is  nonexistent. Every one of her prior relationships--six in all--has ended  disastrously, with Katherine getting dumped. Each time, she retreats further and  further into her shell, until her most intimate relationship is with her remote  control.

Tara,  Katherine, and Fintan, as well as their quirky cast of friends (people with  names like Lorcan and Mandii), live, love, and learn the hard way, the only way  they can. Not quite as obsessive as Bridget Jones and that damn diary of hers,  Keyes manages to convey a painfully accurate portrayal of what it means to be  single today, tempered by a few of life's less humiliating and more important  lessons, like the value of true friendship.

In this new twist on the Trojan War story, Patroclus and Achilles are the quintessential mismatched pair--a mortal underdog exiled in shame and a glorious demigod revered by all--but what would a novel of ancient Greece be without star-crossed love?

In three millennia,The Iliadhas garnered somewhat wider attention thanThe Wizard of Oz, with which I have played, so I have to ask: where do you get the noive? How did you come to dare to take on such a daunting task, and for your first book?Madeline Miller:A little knowledge is a dangerous thing, and in my case it was just dangerous enough to get me started. If I had stopped to ponder, I think I might have been too intimidated. But it helped that Patroclus is such an underdog&mdash;giving him voice felt like standing up for him. I had been intensely frustrated by a number of articles that kept side-stepping the love between him and Achilles, which to me felt so obviously at the story&rsquo;s heart. So I wanted to set the record straight, as I saw it.Maguire:The novel tells the story of the rise, fall and immortalization of the golden Achilles. You approach his famous story from a sideline, that of Patroclus, his bosom companion and lover. Was it hard to keep the mighty arc of legend from overwhelming shadowy Patroclus, and did you write more of him than you ended up using, just to be sure you had him firmly grounded in your mind?Miller:Definitely yes to the second. I actually spent five years writing a first draft of the novel, took a good long look at it, then threw it out and started from scratch. Even though not a word survived, that draft was an essential first step. It helped me understand the story and characters, especially Patroclus, from the inside out.As for the overwhelming legends, I actually think they worked in my favor&mdash;because Patroclus is overwhelmed by them himself.  He is this ordinary person who is pulled into a terrifying world of angry deities and destiny because of his love for Achilles.Maguire:Having glancingly heard of this legend before, I knew more or less how it would end. I had no idea how you might handle the loss of perspective and point of view when tragedy would inevitably strike. You managed to narrate an almost impossible transition from life into myth in part, I think, by your instinctual use of a combination of present and past tense, to say nothing of a masterly combining of authorial and first person observations. How many slaughtered bulls did you sacrifice, and on whose altar, to deserve the talent to risk such dangerous technique?Miller:It was a lot of bulls. And whatever ended up working, I give all the credit to my background in theater. When I first started writing, I had this idea that I should be in control of the story, forcing it forward. It never worked. What I needed to do was learn how to get in character, and write from there.It took me a long time to find just the right tone for the ending&mdash;I kept writing and throwing away, writing and throwing away. Then, in the middle of apartment-hunting, inspiration struck. All the other ideas had started out well, but would gum up before they got anywhere near the finish line. But this one kept humming right along. And it was the simplest, so there you go.Maguire:Oscar Wilde said something like, &ldquo;The Odyssey was written by Homer, or another Greek of the same name.&rdquo; But Oscar Wilde had clearly not met you.

        "0060531231": "Unlike the hero of Quinn's newest Regency-era romance, who falls in love with his cousin's wife upon first sight, readers won't be swept off their feet by the protagonists of this tale. Indeed, while Michael Stirling, dubbed the Merry Rake, is charming enough, subdued Francesca Bridgerton rarely seems worthy of his pursuit. All is well at the novel's outset, aside from the fact that Michael covets his cousin, the Earl of Kilmartin's, wife. Then, barely two chapters into the book, his cousin suffers an aneurysm and dies. Devastated and unable to cope with his new position as earl and his feelings for Francesca, Michael flees to India for four years, only to return still very much in love and suffering from malaria. In London, the two attend social events, trade quips and try to restore their friendship, but the more intimate they become, the more their feelings of guilt gnaw at them. Guilt is the only thing that stands in the way of the couple's happiness, and it's often frustrating to witness their slow, overwrought progression from denial to acceptance. While this book possesses some of the qualities that Quinn's fans have come to expect&mdash;sprightly prose, feverish love scenes and well-developed secondary characters&mdash;it is weighed down by the sheer intensity of the protagonists' grief.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0061147974": "After the release of Hill's acclaimed novelHeart-Shaped Box, this collection of his short fiction, originally published in Britain two years ago made its way to the United States. Hill, the son of horror master Stephen King, runs a diverse gamut that includes some unapologetic chillers along the lines of the book's title story. Yet the essence of his material could best be described as a hybrid that connects the ironic twists from episodes ofThe Twilight Zonewith the angst and vulnerability of childhood and adolescence. David LeDoux, whose previous audiobook credits include Douglas Coupland'sHey Nostradamus!and Sara Gruen'sWater for Elephants, demonstrates an especially keen knack for capturing the cadence of teen and young adult male speech patterns, with equal parts deadpan cool and quivering tension. Hill's novella Voluntary Committal provides a sublime experience of jarring suspense and compelling family drama. Admittedly, a few of the briefer works may leave listeners longing for more fully developed story lines, but Hill consistently manages to evoke emotional responses and provoke unsettling questions, which makes for a worthwhile experience.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0061478741": "Starred Review.The experiences of a woman drawn into the 1971 Bangladesh war for independence illuminate the conflict's wider resonances in Anam's impressive debut, the first installment in a proposed trilogy. Rehana Haque is a widow and university student in Dhaka with two children, 17-year-old daughter Maya and 19-year-old son Soheil. As she follows the daily patterns of domesticity&mdash;cooking, visiting the cemetery, marking religious holidays&mdash;she is only dimly aware of the growing political unrest until Pakistani tanks arrive and the fighting begins. Suddenly, Rehana's family is in peril and her children become involved in the rebellion. The elegantly understated restraint with which Anam recounts ensuing events gives credibility to Rehana's evolution from a devoted mother to a woman who allows her son's guerrilla comrades to bury guns in her backyard and who shelters a Bengali army major after he is wounded. The reader takes the emotional journey from atmospheric scenes of the marketplace to the mayhem of invasion, the ruin of the city, evidence of the rape and torture of Hindus and Bengali nationalists, and the stench and squalor of a refugee camp. Rehana's metamorphosis encapsulates her country's tragedy and makes for an immersive, wrenching narrative.(Jan.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Constable Barbara Havers face their most challenging and perilous case yet&mdash;the linked murders of four youths, three of black or mixed parentage&mdash;in bestseller George's absorbing 13th British police procedural (after 2003'sA Place of Hiding). Crime fans will find plenty of forensic minutiae and details of police bureaucracy and politics, but it's characterization at which George really excels. The up-and-down career of Havers is at low ebb following her demotion from sergeant to constable, and her rocky personal life doesn't make that easier to bear. Lynley's professional life has become more difficult due to the continued absence of Supt. Malcolm Webberly and the need to deal directly with Asst. Commissioner David Hillier. The tension builds as the brutal serial killings continue and the pressure to solve them mounts. George expertly uses every device in the book from red herrings to blind alleys, from subtle twists to swift shocks.

The whole world must decide between American values and its two oppositional alternatives: Islamism and European-style democratic socialism.Prager&#8212;a bestselling author, columnist, and nationally syndicated radio talk show host who is read and heard by millions of people in America and abroad&#8212;makes the case for the American value system as the most viable program ever devised to produce a good society. Those values are explained here more clearly and persuasively than ever before.Still the Best Hopedeals with three huge themes: The first is perhaps the most persuasive explanation for why Leftism has been and will always be a moral failure, despite its acknowledged appeal to many people of goodwill. The second explains why fundamentalist Islam, despite its historic and growing appeal, cannot make a good society. But Prager holds out hope for an open and tolerant Islam and explains why it will emerge from faithful American Muslims. The third is a singularly persuasive defense and explanation of what Prager calls the \"American Trinity\": liberty, values rooted in the Creator, and the melting-pot ideal. These values are inscribed on every American coin as \"Liberty,\" \"In God We Trust,\" and \"E Pluribus Unum,\" and they are the reasons for America's greatness. Without them, America will cease to be an exceptional nation, and therefore cease to be America.Prager shows why these values can and must be adopted by every nation and culture in the world, why Americans must relearn and recommit to these values, and why America must vigorously export them. For if the world does not adopt American values, the result will be chaos and barbarism on an unprecedented scale.",

Her 17 dogs died, too, due to an intense buildup of heat in the trailer. The investigation leads to the deceased woman's siblings, grandmother, and father, and two murdered female reporters. As the facts come together, it becomes apparent that the victim's father raped his daughters, impregnating at least two. While working on the case, Brady deals with the local animal activist group and illegal immigrants, all while running for reelection. While none of the scenes depict details of the incestuous relationships, the lasting effect of abuse becomes a major point of the story. The human abuse in turn leads back to the topic of animal abuse, painting a sad picture of the horrors of both. But Jance manages to keep the atmosphere positive, with lots of action, energy, and realism along the way, and Brady's personal thoughts and beliefs give a perspective to the events.

But they still found much to savor, particularly Bourdain's biting personality, his own humorous self-deprecation, his ability to bring out the unknown elements of the restaurant industry, particularly the kitchen and service staff who might otherwise be ignored, and, not least of all, the well-written (if often vulgar) and compelling stories.

Gone, baby, gone.\" Of all the chilling, completely credible scenes of sadness, destruction, and betrayal in Dennis Lehane's fourth and very possibly best book about Kenzie and Gennaro, this moment stands out because it captures in a few pages the essence of Lehane's success.Private detectives Kenzie and Gennaro, who live in the same working-class Dorchester neighborhood of Boston where they grew up, have gone to visit drug dealer Cheese in prison because they think he's involved in the kidnapping of 4-year-old Amanda McCready. Without sentimentalizing the grotesque figure of Cheese, Lehane tells us enough about his past to make us understand why he and the two detectives might share enough trust to possibly save a child's life when all the best efforts of traditional law enforcement have failed. By putting Kenzie and Gennaro just to one side of the law (but not totally outside; they have several cop friends, a very important part of the story), Lehane adds depth and edge to traditional genre relationships. The lifelong love affair between Kenzie and Gennaro--interrupted by her marriage to his best friend--is another perfectly controlled element that grows and changes as we watch. Surrounded by dead, abused, and missing children, Kenzie mourns and rages while Gennaro longs for one of her own. So the choices made by both of them in the final pages of this absolutely gripping story have the inevitability of life and the dazzling beauty of art.Other Kenzie/Gennaro books available in paperback:Darkness, Take My Hand,A Drink Before the War,Sacred.--Dick Adler--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

She starts a weekly knitting class, hoping to improve business and make friends in the area. The initial class project is a baby blanket, and Macomber (Changing Habits), a knitter herself who offers tips about the craft and pithy observations from knitting professionals throughout the novel, includes the knitting pattern at the start of the book.

Unfortunately, Macomber doesn't get much below the surface of her characters, and, although they all have interesting back stories, the arc of each individual happy ending is too predictable.

Much to their horror (if not surprise), their dormitory at the mill is crowded and damp, they are forced to work with spinning saw blades, they are fed only one meal a day (not counting the chewing gum they get for lunch), and worst of all, Count Olaf lurks in a dreadful disguise as Shirley the receptionist just down the street. Not even the clever wordplay and ludicrous plot twists could keep this story buoyant--reading about the mean-spirited foreman, the deadly blades, poor Klaus (hypnotized and \"reprogrammed\"), and the relentless hopelessness of the children's situation only made us feel gloomy. Fans of these wickedly funny, suspenseful adventures won't want to miss out on a single one, but we're hoping the next tales have the delicate balance of delight and disaster we've come to expect from this exciting series.

        "006198390X": "This is the ultimate cold case&#xFFFD;tragic, high-profile, and, finally, successfully solved. Six-year-old Adam Walsh was abducted from a crowded Sears store in Hollywood, Florida, in 1981. Later, he was murdered and decapitated. Identifying Adam&#xFFFD;s killer took 25 years. His parents turned into tireless advocates for missing and abused children; Adam&#xFFFD;s father, John Walsh, moved from a sales job to being the executive producer and host of America&#xFFFD;s Most Wanted. This forceful account, written with Matthews, former sergeant with the Miami Beach Police Department, who worked the case for years, gives readers the ultimate insider&#xFFFD;s account of the grueling search for Adam&#xFFFD;s killer and for the evidence to convict him. While many true-crime books claim to shine a light on society by examining one particular case, this account actually does. No reader can come away from this without appreciating what it takes to keep pursuing an investigation, against the obstacles of police politics and bureaucracy. Wrenching and riveting. --Connie Fletcher",

        "0060539097": "With its wit (the book is dedicated to Onan), its victim narrative (multiple sexual assaults), its celebrity dish (Howard Stern is actually well endowed), and its frank, one-fisted prose style (\"After three hours of sweaty, psychotic sex, she handed me a huge black strap-on\"), the queen of porn's autobiography is destined to become a lowbrow classic. Jameson's career began at 16, when she fell for Jack, a tattoo artist. At a party, Jack's neo-Nazi uncle raped Jameson. Unable to face her father, a Las Vegas cop, she moved in with Jack. Within a year, she went from high school cheerleader to stripper to nude model to porn actress, with a stop along the way to become a crack addict. Jameson's life wasn't so much a downward spiral as a freefall into darkness. But, as the porn world would have it, the harder she fell, the more everyone wanted her, and she quickly became a top nude model and porn star, and the country's highest-paid feature dancer, all while leaving a path of carnage worthy of several rock bands. Beneath Jameson's monstrous diva exterior, however, was a girl who just wanted to become a loving mother and wife. After many failures, she finally succeeded, and her X-rated book ends on an uplifting family-values note. Jameson's life was a mess, and with its multiple formats (interview transcripts, movie scripts, advice sidebars, diary entries, cartoon strips), so is this book. But it's a remarkably appealing and honest mess, and should earn Jameson some of the mainstream acceptance she so clearly desires.

All too conscious of the state of his 44-year-old knees after a working life standing at restaurant stoves, but with the unlooked-for jackpot ofKitchen Confidentialas collateral, Mr. Bourdain evidently concluded he needed a bit more wind under his wings.The idea of \"perfect meal\" in this context is to be taken to mean not necessarily the most upscale, chi-chi, three-star dining experience, but the ideal combination of food, atmosphere, and company. This would take in fishing villages in Vietnam, bars in Cambodia, and Tuareg camps in Morocco (roasted sheep's testicle, as it happens); it would stretch to smoked fish and sauna in the frozen Russian countryside and the French Laundry in California's Napa Valley. It would mean exquisitely refinedkaisekirituals in Japan after yakitori with drunken salarymen. Deep-fried Mars Bars in Glasgow and Gordon Ramsay in London.

        "0060753943": "If you judge books by their covers, Jack Welch'sWinningcertainly grabs your attention. Testimonials on the back come from none other than Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, Rudy Giuliani, and Tom Brokaw, and other praise comes fromFortune,Business Week, andFinancial Times. As the legendary retired CEO of General Electric, Welch has won many friends and admirers in high places. In this latest book, he strives to show why.Winningdescribes the management wisdom that Welch built up through four and a half decades of work at GE, as he transformed the industrial giant from a sleepy \"Old Economy\" company with a market capitalization of $4 billion to a dynamic new one worth nearly half a trillion dollars.Welch's first book,Jack: Straight from the Gut, was structured more as a conventional CEO memoir, with stories of early career adventures, deals won and lost, boardroom encounters, and Welch's process and philosophy that helped propel his success as a manager. InWinning, Welch focuses on his actual management techniques. He starts with an overview of cultural values such as candor, differentiation among employees, and inclusion of all voices in decision-making. In the second section he covers issues around one's own company or organization: the importance of hiring, firing, the people management in between, and a few other juicy topics like crisis management. From there, Welch moves into a discussion of competition, and the external factors that can influence a company's success: strategy, budgeting, and mergers and acquisitions. Welch takes a more personal turn later with a focus on individual career issues--how to find the right job, get promoted, and deal with a bad boss--and then a final section on what he calls \"Tying Up Loose Ends.\" Those interested in the human side of great leaders will find this last section especially appealing. In it, Welch answers the most interesting questions that he's received in the last several years while traveling the globe addressing audiences of executives and business-school students. Perhaps the funniest question in this section comes at the very end, posed originally by a businessman in Frankfurt, who queried Welch on whether he thought he'd go to heaven (we won't give away the ending).While different from the steadier stream of war stories and real-life examples of Welch's first book,Winningis a very worthwhile addition to any management bookshelf. It's not often that a CEO described as the century's best retires, and then chooses to expound on such a wide range of management topics. Also, aside from the commentary on always-relevant issues like employee performance reviews and quality control, Welch suffuses this book with his pugnacious spirit. The Massachusetts native who fought his way to the top of the world's most valuable company was in many ways the embodiment of \"Winning,\" and this spirit alone will provide readers an enjoyable read.--Peter Han",

Mother and daughter have had a difficult, peripatetic life performing magic shows and conducting s&#xE9;ances, but when they land in New York City, they find a stable home and increasing fame (even Vanderbilts attend their performances). For Marguerite, it&#x2019;s a matter of being a good actress, but for 16-year-old Anna, there&#x2019;s more to it than sleight of hand, as she truly feels and sees things that are inexplicable, adding excitement and danger to their shows and lives. Regardless of whether this ability is a matter of pedigree or coincidence, it makes her a person of interest to suave young men, dangerous kidnappers, and the real-life Society for Psychical Research. Yet despite these promising details, the story&#x2019;s actual point is rather nebulous and blandly executed. Still, the 1920s elements of prohibition, automobiles, and cloche hats are interesting, and the timeless adolescent themes of self-definition, rebellion, and romance infuse the magic with a realism that may be comforting, if predictable.

In the much-anticipated third volume of the Wicked Years, we return to Oz, seen now through the eyes of the Cowardly Lion&#8212;the once tiny cub defended by Elphaba inWicked.While civil war looms in Oz, a tetchy oracle named Yackle prepares for death. Before her final hour, an enigmatic figure known as Brrr&#8212;the Cowardly Lion&#8212;arrives searching for information about Elphaba Thropp, the Wicked Witch of the West. As payment, Yackle, who hovered on the sidelines of Elphaba's life, demands some answers of her own.Brrr surrenders his story to the ailing maunt: Abandoned as a cub, his earliest memories are gluey hazes, and his path from infancy in the Great Gillikin Forest is no Yellow Brick Road. Seeking to redress an early mistake, he trudges through a swamp of ghosts, becomes implicated in a massacre of trolls, and falls in love with a forbidding Cat princess. In the wake of laws that oppress talking Animals, he avoids a jail sentence by agreeing to serve as a lackey to the war-mongering Emperor of Oz.A Lion Among Menchronicles a battle of wits hastened by the Emerald City's approaching armies. What does the Lion know of the whereabouts of the Witch's boy, Liir? What can Yackle reveal about the auguries of the Clock of the Time Dragon? And what of the Grimmerie, the magic book that vanished as quickly as Elphaba? Is destiny ever arbitrary? Can those tarnished by infamy escape their sobriquets&#8212;cowardly, wicked, brainless, criminally earnest&#8212;to claim their own histories, to live honorably within their own skins before they're skinned alive?At once a portrait of a would-be survivor and a panoramic glimpse of a world gone shrill with war fever, Gregory Maguire's new novel is written with the sympathy and power that have made his books contemporary classics.About the AuthorGregory Maguire is the bestselling author ofConfessions of an Ugly Stepsister,Lost, Mirror Mirror, and the Wicked Years series, which includesWicked,Son of a Witch, andA Lion Among Men.Wicked, now a beloved classic, is the basis for the Tony Award-winning Broadway musical of the same name. Maguire has lectured on art, literature, and culture both at home and abroad. He lives with his family near Boston, Massachusetts.A Letter from Gregory MaguireDear friends,Here it is: volume three in my series coming to be known as The Wicked Years. I have had such warm reader response toWickedandSon of a Witch, both initially and in the years since, that the thought of adding to the series made me feel--well, cowardly. I resisted for a while. But courage comes to those who wait, sometimes: so here is volume three.A Lion Among Menfollows the peripatetic career of the Cowardly Lion. First seen inWickedas a lion cub culled from his pride for the purpose of laboratory experimentation, the Lion (known as Brrr) makes his name in that little Matter of Dorothy about which all of Oz is still talking. But one doesn&#x2019;t necessarily become lion-hearted by going after public approval, by racking up those medals and titles and golden statuettes at award ceremonies.Tarnished with scandal of every stripe, Brrr is loathed by the Animals who believe he betrayed them in helping Dorothy do in the Witch. He fares no better trying to live as a lion among men. When civil war breaks out in Oz, Brrr is caught in the line of fire as he interviews the mysterious old oracle, Yackle, about the sources of Elphaba&#x2019;s power. He must choose how much approval he can live without. A bit player all his life, he may yet be the linchpin on which the prosecution of the war rests.When I travel abroad (and the continuing success of the musicalWickedhas brought me to countries where it is now playing), I am sometimes met with bemusement about the origins of the material--a children&#x2019;s book made famous by a musical film for children!--how can this serve as a proper metaphor for a meditation about predestination and free will, about political opportunism and personal valor?Maybe, I say, you have to be an American to see that a vaudeville comedian in baggy lion-pajamas, as Burt Lahr seemed to me, has just as much right to inspire a story about the education of a hero as any Siegfried or Lancelot or Joan of Arc.And if they reply,You have some nerve!I answerThank you. I hope so.And I do thank you for your lion-hearted confidence in these wicked novels.-- Gregory",

        "0060590297": "Starred Review.Moore's latest (after 2006'sA Dirty Job) is a cheerfully perverse, gut-busting tale of young vampires in love. Nineteen-year-old Tommy is a bewildered hipster recently relocated to San Francisco from Incontinence, Ind. His sarcastic redhead (and bloodsucking) girlfriend, Jody, brings him into the fold of the undead (\"I wanted us to be together,\" she says). Tommy, understandably, has mixed feelings; vampirism has its perks (you can turn to mist, live forever and the sex is awesome), but sunlight is death and blood hunger makes you do some pretty foul things. Also, the duo is hunted by Elijah, the ancient vampire who \"turned\" Jody and wants her back, and a band of Safeway stock boys/amateur vampire hunters known as the Animals (with whom pre&ndash;dark side Tommy once rolled). With the assistance of their devoted minion, goth girl Abby Normal, whose hilarious diary entries form part of the narrative, Tommy and Jody evade their pursuers, feeding at night and conking out at dawn, all the while learning how vampirism complicates love. Moore writes with the jittery energy of a brilliant, charming class clown, mixing sex and gore and a potty mouth with a goofy-sweet sensibility to deliver laughs on nearly every page.(Jan.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0060734000": "Cole Matthews is angry. Angry, defiant, smug--in short, a bully. His  anger has taken him too far this time, though. After beating up a ninth-grade  classmate to the point of brain damage, Cole is facing a prison sentence. But  then a Tlingit Indian parole officer named Garvey enters his life, offering an  alternative called Circle Justice, based on Native American traditions, in which  victim, offender, and community all work together to find a healing solution.  Privately, Cole sneers at the concept, but he's no fool--if it gets him out of  prison, he'll do anything. Ultimately, Cole ends up banished for one year to a  remote Alaskan island, where his arrogance sets him directly in the path of a  mysterious, legendary white bear. Mauled almost to death, Cole awaits his fate  and begins the transition from anger to humility.Ben Mikaelsen's depiction of a juvenile delinquent's metamorphosis into a  caring, thinking individual is exciting and fascinating, if at times  heavy-handed. Cole's nastiness and the vivid depictions of the lengths he must  go to survive after the (equally vivid) attack by the bear are excruciating at  times, but the concept of finding a way to heal a whole community when one  individual wrongs another is compelling. The jacket cover photo of the author in  a bear hug with the 700-pound black bear that he and his wife adopted and raised  is definitely worth seeing!

        "0099277093": "McEwan's name will be on everyone's lips with his startling new novel, an impeccably constructed psychological thriller set in Berlin during the Cold War. Basing his story on an actual (but little known) incident, he tells of the secret tunnel under the Soviet sector which the British and Americans built in 1954 to gain access to the Russians' communication system. The protagonist, Leonard Marnham, is a 25-year-old, naive, unsophisticated English post office technician who is astonished and alarmed to find himself involved in a top-secret operation. At the same time that he loses his political innocence, Leonard experiences his sexual initiation in a clandestine affair with a German divorcee five years his senior. As his two secret worlds come together, events develop into a gruesome nightmare, far more macabre than anything McEwan ( The Child in Time ) has previously written, building to a searing, unforgettable scene of surrealist intensity in which Leonard and his lover try to conceal evidence of a murder. Acting to save himself from a prison sentence, Leonard desperately performs an act of espionage whose ironic consequences resonate down the years to a twister of an ending. Though its plot rivals any thriller in narrative tension, this novel is also a character study--of a young man coming of age in bizarre circumstances, and of differences in national character: the gentlemanly Brits, all decorum and civility; the brash, impatient Americans; the cynical Germans. McEwan's neat, tensile prose raises this book to the highest level of the genre.

There she meets gorgeous, blue-eyed Cameron Hamilton, a fellow student who seems as attracted to her as she is to him. Haunted by her traumatic past, Avery is torn between protecting herself and finding love. The path to romance is long and rocky, and Cam has dark secrets of his own, but eventually both lovers come clean and all loose ends are neatly wrapped up. While Lynn's peripheral characters are fairly one-dimensional, Avery and Cam are compelling. Fans of stories about characters healed by love will find this one moderately satisfying.

What he ended up with instead wasThe Ocean at the of the Lane--his first adult novel sinceAnansi Boyscame out in 2005, and a narrative so thoughtful and thrilling that it's as difficult to stop reading as it was for Gaiman to stop writing. Forty years ago, our narrator, who was then a seven-year-old boy, unwittingly discovered a neighboring family&rsquo;s supernatural secret. What happens next is an imaginative romp through otherwordly adventure that could only come from Gaiman's magical mind.

The format can aptly be described asSuper Mario KartmeetsMortal Kombat, which makes for an odd, yet addictive game. The object is to throw, punch, smash, or blast your opponents off the edge of the beautifully rendered, themed arenas. Numerous power-ups, weapons, and surprises help or hinder the melee. Your eventual goal is to fight your way through to a bizarre final boss character. Victory in this battle rewards you with another character to play, such as the scene-stealing Pok&eacute;mon, Jigglypuff.From Star Fox's laser pistol to Link's hook shot, each character's trademark special abilities are utilized to knock one another off the screen.

Now, in Palin&#x2019;s much-hyped book, he&#x2019;s just a fat, smoking bullet-head who told her to &#x201C;stick to the script.&#x201D; The feeling running through Going Rogue is that Palin has been bursting to take a whack at those she believes didn&#x2019;t do right by her during the campaign.

Then lots and lots of Alaska politics, which will probably be a little hard even for people from Alaska to plow through. (Scores are settled here, too.) Once Palin gets into the 2008 campaign, the tone is folksy, but the knives are out. Much has been made of her criticisms of Schmidt and another McCain staffer, Nicolle Wallace. But less has been said about Palin&#x2019;s comments about Barack Obama. For instance, she notes that when she and husband Todd first heard Obama speak, they saw the wow factor but worried that his &#x201C;smooth&#x201D; talk would hide his radical ideas. She also implies that Obama wanted to shield only his own children from the press, though, in fact, in September 2008, he told CNN that Palin&#x2019;s children must be off limits as well. Ronald Reagan&#x2019;s name is mentioned by page 3 and invoked regularly throughout. There&#x2019;s no doubt Palin sees herself as heir to his legacy.

Vampires from all over the globe have gathered around Lestat, who lies prostrate on the floor of a cathedral. Dead? In a coma? As Armand reflects on Lestat's condition, he is drawn by David Talbot to tell the story of his own life. The narrative abruptly rushes back to 15th-century Constantinople, and the Armand of the present recounts the fragmented memories of his childhood abduction from Kiev. Eventually, he is sold to a Venetian artist (and vampire), Marius. Rice revels in descriptions of the sensual relationship between the young and still-mortal Armand and his vampiric mentor. But when Armand is finally transformed, the tone of the book dramatically shifts. Raw and sexually explicit scenes are displaced by Armand's introspective quest for a union of his Russian Orthodox childhood, his hedonistic life with Marius, and his newly acquired immortality. These final chapters remind one of the archetypal significance of Rice's vampires; at their best, Armand, Lestat, and Marius offer keen insights into the most human of concerns.The Vampire Armandis richly intertextual; readers will relish the retelling of critical events from Lestat and Louis's narratives. Nevertheless, the novel is very much Armand's own tragic tale.

Desperate to find her father, and grimly determined to help save the Old Kingdom from destruction by the horrible forces of the evil undead, Sabriel endures almost impossible exhaustion, violent confrontations, and terrifying challenges to her supernatural abilities--and her destiny.Garth Nix delves deep into the mystical underworld of necromancy, magic, and the monstrous undead. This tale is not for the faint of heart; imbedded in the classic good-versus-evil story line are subplots of grisly ghouls hungry for human life to perpetuate their stay in the world of the living, and dark, devastating secrets of betrayal and loss. Justtryto put this book down. For more along this line, try Nix's later novel:Shade's Children. (Ages 12 and older)--Emilie Coulter",
        "0062314254": "InFahrenheit 451, Ray Bradbury's classic, frightening vision of the future, firemen don't put out fires--they start them in order to burn books. Bradbury's vividly painted society holds up the appearance of happiness as the highest goal--a place where trivial information is good, and knowledge and ideas are bad. Fire Captain Beatty explains it this way, &quot;Give the people contests they win by remembering the words to more popular songs.... Don't give them slippery stuff like philosophy or sociology to tie things up with. That way lies melancholy.&quot;Guy Montag is a book-burning fireman undergoing a crisis of faith. His wife spends all day with her television &quot;family,&quot; imploring Montag to work harder so that they can afford a fourth TV wall. Their dull, empty life sharply contrasts with that of his next-door neighbor Clarisse, a young girl thrilled by the ideas in books, and more interested in what she can see in the world around her than in the mindless chatter of the tube. When Clarisse disappears mysteriously, Montag is moved to make some changes, and starts hiding books in his home. Eventually, his wife turns him in, and he must answer the call to burn his secret cache of books. After fleeing to avoid arrest, Montag winds up joining an outlaw band of scholars who keep the contents of books in their heads, waiting for the time society will once again need the wisdom of literature.Bradbury--the author of more than 500 short stories, novels, plays, and poems, includingThe Martian ChroniclesandThe Illustrated Man--is the winner of many awards, including the Grand Master Award from the Science Fiction Writers of America. Readers ages 13 to 93 will be swept up in the harrowing suspense ofFahrenheit 451, and no doubt will join the hordes of Bradbury fans worldwide.--Neil Roseman--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

And many believe these shifts are doing more than just rocking the political and social climate; they're rocking the American core.What are these changes? Who, in addition to President Obama, have been the biggest forces behind them? What exactly do they mean for you, the everyday American citizen? How are they affecting your money, health, safety, freedom, and standing in this nation? Which are Pinheaded moves and which are truly Patriotic? In his latest spirited book, O'Reilly prompts further debate with the President and the American people on the current state of the union.After five consecutive, no-nonsense, tell-it-like-it-is megabestsellers, you can count on Bill to offer blunt and constructive political commentary. And as he did in his popular memoir, he offers some introspection too, looking back at his own actions and those of past Pinheads and Patriots who have inspired a code of conduct for such taxing times.As always, O'Reilly is fair, balanced, and uncompromisingly tough when guarding the American way. Only Pinheads would fail to fight for what they love most about this country or to embrace some measure of change to make it better.

        "0062202529": "This debut effort from Smith, a war correspondent turned surfing journalist with a cruel, sometimes witty eye, is a mix of reportage and gonzo journalism for the surfing set. Mixing shameless, fey bluster that he dubs Trash Prose and occasionally trenchant observation, Smith delves into the scene surrounding the big-money surfing contests on Oahu, Hawaii's legendary North Shore. As the pro circuit arrives for the winter wave season, Smith sketches an expos&eacute; of the tensions between local Hawaiian surfers and low-level gangsters and the established surfing professionals, surfwear brand representatives, and out-of-towners during this seasonal demographic change. Smith's favorite subject, however, is himself: he sees himself as an outlaw raconteur whose articles garner so much resentment he gets roughed up at a party. He also provides endless descriptions of his wardrobe&mdash;he calls his style his version of Island Dandy, which is purposefully at odds with everything Oahu's North Shore stands for. If Hunter S. Thompson circa Hell's Angels merged with a fashion critic to write about surfing for Maxim, the result might be similar. Smith's approach is myopic, writing for an audience that already knows the sport and the names. There are some astute observations (particularly his analysis of why surfing is essentially a lonely sport), but ultimately the book fails to reveal much beyond the author's considerable self-regard.

Voice recognition and real-time lip synching heighten the absorbing experience. The Unreal Engine 3 technology brings out the smallest details in the largest of battles. WithGOWyou're sure to experience a rich, dynamic world where characters spring to life. Speaking of life, the battlefield is a lethal place. To survive, you must suppress your enemy with blindfire, take cover in interactive environments, and use weapons and teammates to outwit your dreaded, inhuman foes. And with a title likeGOW, it would be shame if you couldn't get online and challenge live gamers. With the next-generation of Xbox Live, you'll be able to experience individualized matchmaking, view player statistics, earn player achievements, customize games, and build personalized gamer profiles.Gears of Warshined bright at Microsoft's pre-E3 press briefing, but a deeper demo at Microsoft's E3 booth revealed many of the game's mechanics.GOWis built with both the hardcore and casual gamer in mind. But, instead of selecting a difficulty level at the start of the game, GOW offers a choice at the beginning of each level. In the vein ofchoose your own adventure, you can select between a difficult or easy path. And it's not just a simple choice of battling tougher enemies; each path (explained by a comrade) represents additional content that is crucial to the storyline. After easing your way into the experience of the gameplay with the simpler paths, you can go back and test your skills on the more difficult routes and never feel like you've played through the areas before.Standing around in the open is likely to get you killed inGOW. You must use cover to survive. With a context sensitive A button function, you won't have to sweat memorizing cumbersome button combos. The A button will:Slam you into cover. As you approach cover inGOWsimply tap the A button to slide and make immediate use of cover.Vault you over the cover. Once you're in cover, pressing up and A will vault you over your cover to engage the opponent or next cover opportunity.Evade enemy fire. When you're forced to be out in the open, tapping the A button will engage a roll maneuver to evade enemy fire.Activate a \"Swat Turn.\" When taking cover on the side of a doorway, pressing the A button will spin your character from one side of the doorway to the other, helping avoid fire.Ripping a magazine free and replacing it in the midst of bloody combat is no easy task.GOWsimulates this difficult action by forcing you to perfect your reloading skills. To be effective in combat you'll need to allot for time to successfully reload your weapon. Do it well and the battle is yours; do it poorly and you may actually jam your gun. Time it perfectly and you'll earn a bonus with a temporary damage boost. ThoughGOWclearly showcases a sci-fi experience, its roots are in tactical, realistic combat scenarios. Therefore, running and gunning makes for seriously erratic shooting. Think about what you're doing. Unless wasting ammo is your goal, you better stop, aim, shoot, and then move on. Otherwise, the Locust Horde might swarm you and take your life.Gears of Warpresents a focused and well-paced cinematic experience, and nothing ruins that faster than a time-consuming exploration of every switch or button to find the elusive trigger to open a door. This game introduces a \"point of interest\" button that comes up on the screen so you can immediately interact with the necessary item to move forward in your gameplay.GOWcertainly offers drool-worthy graphics, but the mechanics have also received equal attention.

Out of options, she reluctantly accepts her father's offer to help refurbish Birdsong, the old family place he recently inherited in Guthrie, Georgia.

Nothing says &#x201C;new and cheap&#x201D; faster than a flimsy hollow-core  door and bright gold repro brass hardware. Look for solid wood doors and wood frame windows at salvage yards and antique  markets. And don&#x2019;t forget to check the &#x201C;building materials&#x201D; category on Craigslist. I got all the doors for my beach  house off Craigslist--for $5 apiece. Vintage hardware can frequently be found at flea markets, or check online sources  like eBay.Vintage light fixtures give a great look--but be sure you factor in the cost of re-wiring them, and finding  good-looking shades. Nothing gives a lamp that &#x201C;granny&#x201D; look faster than a dingy yellow shade.Before you invest in antique cast-iron claw-foot tubs or sinks, make sure they have proper fittings. Measure drains  and faucet spreads and make sure you can find new ones that will fit and function properly. Antique toilets are  generally a bad idea--most local codes require low-flow toilets for water conservation.Before re-wiring a house, put together a furniture floor plan. You don&#x2019;t want a heat register under the living room  sofa, but you will want outlets on either side of the bed for reading lamps, and for any area that might be used as an  office you&#x2019;ll want plenty of grounded plugs. And how about that flat-screen television your husband wants? Plan now for  cable locations.Be flexible. A great fireplace surround could become a headboard, as could an old paneled door--turned sideways.  And that leaded glass window that had to be removed in the remodel? Why not fit it with mirrors and a hinge and make it  into a bathroom medicine cabinet?Top Five Best Junking FindsPair of barrel-back armchairs--$30 at an estate sale.

Here, thankfully, he encounters a caring teacher who recommends further medical evaluation, and Joey is eventually able to return to his former school. There is hope for Joey on the last page--he sits in the Big Quiet Chair to read. Gantos has achieved an unusual feat with this book. We want to turn away from Joey's shifting prison of emotions. But for those who stick with him, he shows us what his life is like. We walk a mile in his shoes, our feet hurting all the way.

        "009952712X": "Originally published in 1946 and out of print for decades, this book by the Nobel Prize-winning Icelandic author is a huge, skaldic treat filled with satire, humor, pathos, cold weather and sheep. Gudbjartur Jonsson becomes Bjartur of Summerhouses when, after 18 years of service to the Bailiff of Myri, he is able to buy his own croft. Summerhouses is probably haunted and is certainly unprepossessing, but Bjartur is a stubborn, leathery old (whatever his age) coot, and he soon has his new bride and few head of sheep installed in a sod house. When his wife dies cold and alone giving birth to the daughter of the Bailiff's son, Bjartur takes the child on almost as another test of his independence. Bjartur survives another wife, three sons that lived and several dead ones, all with his \"armour of scepticism,\" which \"endowed him with greater moral fortitude than that possessed by the other men.\" Through hard times (in the guises of worms and a cow that threaten his precious sheep), Bjartur maintains his ferocious and self-destructive independence, one aimed not so much at bettering his condition as being able to tell his former employer where to get off. Laxness is merciless with the hypocrisy of the upper classes, as exemplified by the Bailiff's poetess wife, who applauds the simple life of poor country people, or the Bailiff's son, whose social-welfare schemes help him but undermine the crofters. Laxness is not easy on Bjartur, who is bloody-minded in the extreme, but he is tender enough to compose a poem to his exiled adoptive daughter, and bold enough to engrave a simple marker in honor of the misunderstood ghoul who has haunted his farm and family. He's a figure that Snorri Sturluson would have recognized.Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an alternatePaperbackedition.",

It is also a fantasy adventure with sea serpents, pirates, and  all sorts of magic. Theliveshipshave distinct personalities and partner with specific people, somewhat likeAnne McCaffrey'sBrain ships and their Brawns, though these are trading ships and have full  crews.Hobb has peopled the book with many wonderfully developed characters.  Most of the primary ones are members of the Vestritts, an Old Trader family which owns the liveshipVivacia.  Their stories are intercut with those of Kennit, the ambitious pirate Brashen, the disinherited scion of another family who served on the Vestritt's ship, andParagon, an old liveship  abandoned and believed mad.   The sentient sea serpents have their own story hinted at, as well.ThoughShip of Magicis full of action, none of the plotlines get resolved in this book. Readers who resent being left with many questions and few answers after almost 700 pages should think twice before starting, or wait until the rest of the series is out so that their suspense won't be too prolonged. But Hobb's writing draws you in and makes you care desperately about what will happen next, the mark of a terrific storyteller.--Nona Vero--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

The pair must pull together to protect a high-tech gizmo that can revolutionize racing-and save their lives. Evanovich burns some rubber and only hits the brakes a few times, thanks to her bright dialogue, race-track savvy and expert depiction of romantic mayhem. Though sometimes it seems as if she's still taking a test drive with this new cast of eccentrics, the pages fly by as the racy tension between Hooker and Barney adds heat to the fun.

But 70 years later, as her great-granddaughter, Grace, is mourning her father&#x2019;s death, Maggie decides it&#x2019;s finally time to share her story. Inspired by the true tale of an Irish community that suffered the largest proportional loss in the sinking, the novel hits on the standard elements of the Titanic story&#x2014;the ship&#x2019;s magnificence, the stark differences between first and third classes, the many elements that contributed to its downfall. What makes Gaynor&#x2019;s novel fresh is the way she sets the tragedy in the context of her characters&#x2019; lives. Gaynor is a gentle storyteller who doesn&#x2019;t challenge the reader, writing prettily but at times predictably. At the same time, even the most avid Titanic buff is sure to find something new in this well-researched, finely detailed story. Just as Maggie&#x2019;s retelling makes the disaster real for her great-granddaughter, Gaynor brings immediacy to the oft-told story by shrinking it to a human scale. --Bridget Thoreson",

If the originalCall of Dutyleft you wanting more, this sequel will more than satisfy your hunger.Fight off waves of invading German troops and Panzer tanks in Moscow.View larger.Race around in your own tank with others at your side in North Africa.View larger.Scale the cliffs of Pointe du Hoc with the Army Rangers.View larger.Just as in the original,Call of Duty 2has you working your way through WWII across three interwoven campaigns. As a private in the Russian army, you will fight off waves of invading German troops and Panzer tanks in Moscow and Stalingrad. Once you finish the Russian campaign, you'll go up against Field Marshal Rommel's troops in the deserts of North Africa. As part of this campaign, you'll race around in your own tank with others at your side, and later you'll be tasked with calling in air strikes against enemy tanks. The final campaign has you in the role of an American corporal in Europe, but unlike most WWII games, you won't perform a D-Day landing on Omaha or Utah Beach. InCall of Duty 2, you have to scale the cliffs of Pointe du Hoc with the Army Rangers amidst a hail of artillery and machine gun fire, giving you a true appreciation of the time-honored saying, \"War is Hell!\"Call of Duty 2is a thinking-gamer's first-person shooter of medium difficulty. While there are many reflexive elements, the game quite often requires you to consider the tactics of the situation in order to survive. While you can probably blow through the game in 10 hours on the regular setting, the more difficult settings require you to be much more thoughtful about your approach to the different scenarios. Your teammates in battle neither finish your fight, nor simply provide enemy fodder, while the enemy AI (artificial intelligence) is quite clever. If you are too meek, you will find yourself pinned down by aggressive fire while the enemy lobs grenades at you until you're decimated.Unlike the its predecessor,Call of Duty 2doesn't give you a health bar. Instead, as you are hit by more and more fire, your screen grows increasingly red around the border, and your character begins to grunt and pant. This is your signal that it's time to find some cover in order to recuperate before you continue. Another major improvement is the enhanced smoke grenades, which not only look great but can be used effectively in battle to obscure your path from tanks or machine-gun nests as you make your way to an objective.WhileCall of Duty 2has received an ESRB T (teen) rating -- meaning there are no gratuitous blood and guts splashing all over the screen -- this is still war, and there are enemies that will try to drag themselves to safety after being hit, only to be bludgeoned to a screaming death by your fellow men-at-arms. And like its older brother,Call of Duty 2offers the standard deathmatch, team deathmatch, capture-the-flag, and search-and-destroy multiplayer modes. However, this version offers a new option called \"headquarters,\" which most closely resembles the \"crazy king\" version of king-of-the-hill in Halo 2. Shifting headquarter points appear and must be captured in order to start building points, only to be overrun by the other side in order to halt that point gain. This version of the multiplayer mode is not only extremely fun, but it requires teams to adapt on the fly.Unlike the original, in this sequel you can skip forward from one mission to the next once you've cleared a campaign. The game also auto-detects 16:9 and 16:10 wide-screen ratios, as well as the sometimes tricky 5:4 ratio for LCD monitors. As the user, you can make use of a good set of performance tweaking functions, or you can allow the game to determine the optimal ratio, based on your system. With the addition of actual war footage as introductions to each campaign, and famous war quotes at the end of the scenes,Call of Duty 2has everything you need to lose yourself in the middle of the biggest war in history of the world.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",
        "0099458322": "The opening pages of a Haruki Murakami novel can be like the view out an airplane window onto tarmac. But at some point between page three and  fifteen--it's page thirteen inKafka On The Shore--the deceptively placid narrative lifts off, and you find yourself breaking through clouds at a tilt, no longer certain where the plane is headed or if the laws of flight even apply.Joining the rich literature of runaways,Kafka On The Shorefollows the solitary, self-disciplined schoolboy Kafka Tamura as he hops a bus from Tokyo to the randomly chosen town of Takamatsu, reminding himself at each step that he has to be \"the world&#xB9;s toughest fifteen-year-old.\" He finds a secluded private library in which to spend his days--continuing his impressive self-education--and is befriended by a clerk and the mysteriously remote head librarian, Miss Saeki, whom he fantasizes may be his long-lost mother. Meanwhile, in a second, wilder narrative spiral, an elderly Tokyo man named Nakata veers from his calm routine by murdering a stranger. An unforgettable character, beautifully delineated by Murakami, Nakata can speak with cats but cannot read or write, nor explain the forces drawing him toward Takamatsu and the other characters.To say that the fantastic elements ofKafka On The Shoreare complicated and never fully resolved is not to suggest that the novel fails. Although it may not live up to Murakami's masterfulThe Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, Nakata and Kafka's fates keep the reader enthralled to the final pages, and few will complain about the loose threads at the end.--Regina Marler--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

        "0062049690": "Amazon Exclusive: A TALE OF PROVENCE: The story behindThe LanternI&rsquo;ve been having a love affair with Provence for more than 25 years. The light, the views, the colors, the heat&mdash;I find them all intoxicating. I went for the first time with the college boyfriend who would become my husband; his family had had a house in the Luberon for some twenty years. We finally bought our own property in France five years ago after my husband decided to give up banking and realize his long-held ambition to compose music.&ldquo;Les Gen&eacute;vriers&rdquo; (not the property&rsquo;s real name) is described inThe Lanternmore or less as we found it. Its setting is as accurate as I can make it without giving away its precise location. The Luberon area is one of the most sought-after locations in Provence, known for its hilltop villages, lavender, abundant fruit and clear bright light. It is the area Peter Mayle famously chronicled inA Year in Provence.In addition to the abandoned farming hamlet, the story has its roots in the lavender fields and perfume industry in the region. There are small lavender fields and tiny family-run lavender distilleries all around where we live, but the main centers are to the north in Sault and, as described in the novel, to the east at Manosque and the Valensole plateau.The idea of a blind perfumer came from the realization that there were strips of Braille on the packaging used by beauty product brand L&rsquo;Occitane en Provence, based at Manosque. In 1997 the company created the foundation Provence dans tous les Sens (All the Senses of Provence) to introduce visually-impaired children to the world of perfume creation. In the novel, Marthe Lincel finds her true talent as a perfume &ldquo;nose&rdquo; after a visit to the Distillerie Musset from the school for the blind she attends in Manosque, although this episode takes place in the 1930s.For most of the 20th century in this region, there was a gradual erosion of traditional farming as young people moved to the towns to seek work in the new industries and factories. The struggle was intense for those left behind on the hill farms in a region that was poor until the advent of mass tourism. InThe Lantern, as Pierre--the only brother--takes off for better-paid work, and Marthe finds increasing success in Paris, this is the struggle faced by B&eacute;n&eacute;dicte at &ldquo;Les Gen&eacute;vriers&rdquo;&mdash;and the past which gradually comes to disquiet Eve, the heroine of the contemporary narrative strand of the novel.Like Eve, I am an avid reader and worryingly prone to over-imagination. While at the house our first summer, camping on stone floors, I re-read Daphne du Maurier&rsquo;sRebecca, and was as captivated by it as ever--but my thoughts wandered... what if I had come to this place knowing less about the area, or perhaps, less about the man I was with?--Deborah LawrensonA Look InsideThe LanternClick on the images below to open larger versions.Lavender field in sunlightGarden door to the walnut wine cellarView from Gordes to the Luberon ridgeA room with a viewSide door into the alleyway",

Those who carve out their lives in the wilderness will fight to the death to protect the water on which they've staked their claim. Lynn and her mother are good shots, picking off stray travelers who are tempted by their pond. Cholera outbreaks throughout the world mean that even when water is available, it could be deadly, and the 16-year-old and her mother spend their days purifying the pond water, hunting for food, persuading meager crops to grow, and standing sentry on their roof to guard against strangers. After her mother is killed by coyotes, Lynn tries to be self-reliant, but she knows that in time the men from a nearby settlement will attempt to seize her land. When her taciturn neighbor Stebbs offers help, she slowly opens herself to his friendship, and her lifelong solitude is further fractured when she meets a family that is trying to survive on the banks of a nearby stream. Lynn grows attached to the little girl and takes her into her home when Lucy's mother, who is starving and in labor, is unable to care for her. Lynn finds herself drawn to Lucy's uncle, who is about her own age. Things come to a head when Lucy becomes deathly ill and the band of men from the nearby settlement attack Lynn's house.

It goes without saying that  then you'll spend most of your daytime hours pounding out the dents from the  previous night's misadventures.Midnight Club Street Racingplays like a combination of the high-res  street shenanigans of the Dreamcast'sTokyo Extreme Racingand  the mission-based mayhem of the PS One'sDriver.

The inclusion of subtitle \"Origins\" in the game's title refers to the six unique origin stories available to new heroes as a new game begins.

The game features three character classes--warrior, mage, and rogue--and three races of being--Human, Elf or Dwarf--that can assume these classes.

This uncertainty allows for a variety of possible dynamics within the party ranging from open hostility, all the way to romance.

Lady Calpurnia Hartwell, a plain but wealthy 28-year-old who refuses to marry a man who only desires her fortune, acts on a long-held crush and flings herself at Gabriel St. John, marquess of Ralston. Gabriel finds her antics more amusing than enticing, but his half-wild half-sister needs an impeccable chaperone and he chooses Callie for the role. Their proximity creates an infinite series of opportunities for the rake to practice his wiles on the more than willing wallflower.

In the small town of New Canaan, N.H., 33-year-old Mariah discovers that her husband, Colin, is having an affair. Years ago, his cheating drove Mariah to attempt suicide and Colin had her briefly committed to an institution. Now Mariah's facing divorce and again fighting depression, when her eight-year-old daughter, Faith, suddenly acquires an imaginary friend. Soon this friend is telling the girl how to bring her grandmother back from the dead and how to cure a baby dying of AIDS. As Faith manifests stigmata, doctors are astounded, and religious controversy ensues, in part because Faith insists that God is a woman. An alarmed Colin sues for custody of Faith, and the fear of losing her daughter dramatically changes meek, diffident Mariah into a strong, protective and brave womanAone who fights for her daughter, holds her own against doctors and lawyers and finds the confidence to pursue a surprising new romance with TV atheist Ian Fletcher, cynical \"Spokesman of the Millennium Generation.\" Though the novel feels a bit long, Picoult's pacing stabilizes the increasingly complicated plot, and the final chapters, in which Mariah fights for Faith's custody in court, are riveting. The mother-daughter relationship is all the more powerful for being buffeted by the exploitative and ethically questionable domains of medicine, media, law and religion; these characters' many triumphant transformations are Picoult's triumphs as well.

Four scientists working for the New York&ndash;based Kingsley International Group have died or disappeared within 24 hours. Wolfish top boss Tanner Kingsley vows to find the perpetrator; meanwhile, stunning artist Diane Stevens, wife of a just-murdered KIG scientist, and supermodel Kelly Harris, whose husband has likewise been killed, find themselves under attack by mysterious strangers. Diane and Kelly form an uneasy alliance, though both spend most of their time ruminating on their wonderful (now dead) husbands: \"I want to feel you stroking my breast.... I want to imagine that I can hear your voice saying that I make the best paella in the world....\" The plot is straightforward: people are killed, women are in peril and an evil CEO (Tanner, gasp!) has a plot to take over the world. His technique involves controlling the weather, and in an intriguing short afterword, Sheldon explains the very real possibilities of just such a scenario. The on-the-lam ladies, Kelly and Diane, escape every assassination attempt with ridiculous ease, and other characters appear and disappear simply in order to get the author out of one plot pickle after another. Still, despite (or because of) Sheldon's blithe unconcern for logic and his just-add-water relationships, this is a breezily pleasing read.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Shifting between the 1960s (not a pretty period in Mississippi history) and the present, it&#x2019;s the story of a respected doctor accused of murdering his former nurse, an African-American woman who has returned to Natchez after many years up north.

        "0060927240": "A change in setting halfway through this ambitious novel by the respected author of Continental Drift and Affliction diminishes its effectiveness to a certain degree. The first half, a starkly realistic, powerful portrait of a troubled adolescent whose life has spiraled out of control, packs a visceral punch. Flunking out of school and already hooked on drugs, the 14-year-old narrator, secretly molested by his stepfather, emotionally abandoned by his weak mother, leaves his mobile home in the depressed upstate New York community of Au Sable and becomes a homeless mall rat. In a burst of bravado, he acquires a crossed bones tattoo, changes his name from Chappie to Bone, and attempts to find some focus in his dead-end existence. Convinced that he is destined for a criminal career, Bone vents his anger in acts of senseless destruction. His vulnerability and his need for love and direction are fused when he and a seven-year-old waif he has rescued from a pedophile take refuge in an abandoned schoolbus with an illegal alien from Jamaica called I-Man, whose Rastafarian wisdom and gentle demeanor are fed by liberal consumption of marijuana, which he deals. It is when Bone follows I-Man to Jamaica that the narrative falters. Though the drug-permeated Jamaican milieu is portrayed with impressive authenticity, the improbability of Bone's macabre adventures there frays the plot's credibility. The novel's strengths-Bone's cool, wisecracking voice and colloquial speech, the details of an adolescent's culture-are diluted by its excesses-too many descriptions of marijuana highs, too many coincidences. Yet one finishes the book with indelible sympathy for tough-guy Bone, touched by his loneliness, fear and desperation, and having absorbed Banks's message: that (as he said recently), society's failure to save its children is \"the main unrecognized tragedy of our time.\" 100,000 first printing; $15,000 ad/promo; author tour.Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

Cuts may  heal, burns vanish, limbs reattach, but for the \"blood god,\" the wounds of the  heart sometimes stay open and raw for centuries. So it is for Marius, Anne  Rice's oft-mentioned and beloved scholar. We've heard parts of his tale in past  volumes of theVampire  Chronicles, but never so completely and never from his own lips. InBlood  and Gold, Rice mostly (but not entirely) avoids the danger of treading worn  ground as she fills out the life and character of Marius the Lonely, the  Disenchanted, the Heartsick--a 2,000-year-old vampire \"with all the conviction  of a mortal man.\"Plucked from his beloved Rome in the prime of his life and forced into solitude  as keeper of the vampire queen and king, Marius has never forgiven the injustice  of his mortal death. Thousands of years later, he still seethes over his losses.  Immortality for Marius is both a blessing and a curse--he bears \"witness to all  splendid and beautiful things human,\" yet is unable to engage in relationships  for fear of revealing his burden.New readers to the Chronicles may wish for a more fleshed-out, less  introspective hero, but Rice's legions of devoted fans will recognizeBlood  and Goldfor what it is: a love song to Marius the Wanderer, whose story  reveals the complexities and limitations of eternal existence.--Daphne  Durham--This text refers to theHardcoveredition.",
        "0061441686": "A seasoned author of supernatural tales, Harrison makes her YA debut with the story of 17-year-old Madison Avery, who is killed by a \"dark reaper\" named Kairos on her prom night. But by stealing Kairos's amulet in the process, Madison manages to retain her soul. Along with Barnabas, a beautiful \"light reaper,\" and Grace, her guardian angel, Madison plots to repossess her body and protect her prom date from Kairos and from the dark reapers' attempts to control time and fate. Having been content as an outsider (\"I was happier being myself-purple hair, loud music, dead, and everything-than trying to fit in\"), Madison must build her trust in others in order to save her life and discover her fate-whether or not she even believes in fate. Though rules and explanations seem at times a little too convenient, Harrison weaves an exciting battle, not between good and evil, but between free will and destiny. A compelling blend of mysticism, suspense and surprise make for a quick and pleasurable read. Ages 12-up.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0060853972": "Pratchett (ofDiscworldfame) and Gaiman (ofSandmanfame) may seem an unlikely combination, but the topic (Armageddon) of this fast-paced novel is old hat to both.   Pratchett's wackiness collaborates with Gaiman's morbid humor; the result is a humanist delight to be savored and reread again and again.  You see, there was a bit of a mixup when the Antichrist was born, due in part to the machinations of Crowley, who did not so much fall as saunter  downwards, and in part to the mysterious ways as manifested in the form of a part-time rare book dealer, an angel named Aziraphale.  Like top agents everywhere, they've long had more in common with each other than the sides they represent, or the conflict they are nominally engaged in.  The only person  who knows how it will all end is Agnes Nutter, a witch whose  prophecies all come true, if one can only manage to decipher them. The minor characters along the way (Famine makes an appearance as diet crazes, no-calorie food and anorexia epidemics) are as much fun as the story as a whole, which adds up to one of those rare books which is enormous fun to read  the first time, and the second time, and the third time...--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

Schreck lures him back into \"the World\" on the pretense that he will be testing new bullets, but instead presses him into his special \"Agency\" unit.

On a September day in 1981, gem trader Isaac Amin is accosted by Revolutionary Guards at his Tehran office and imprisoned for no other crime than being Jewish in a country where Muslim fanaticism is growing daily. Being rich and having had slender ties to the Shah's regime magnify his peril. In anguish over what might be happening to his family, Isaac watches the brutal mutilation and executions of prisoners around him. His wife, Farnaz, struggles to keep from slipping into despair, while his young daughter, Shirin, steals files from the home of a playmate whose father is in charge of the prison that holds her father. Far away in Brooklyn, Isaac's nonreligious son, Parviz, struggles without his family's money and falls for the pious daughter of his Hasidic landlord. Nicely layered, the story shimmers with past secrets and hidden motivations. The dialogue, while stiff, allows the various characters to come through.

Cornelia and her husband, Teo, move to suburban Philadelphia, where she finds it difficult to fit into the sorority-like atmosphere. Despite a bevy of domestic dramas (planning a family among them), Cornelia's first-person chapters are the quietest of the three points of view. Seemingly shallow and vicious, neighbor Piper shows her kinder side as she struggles through her best friend's fight against cancer. Though the extreme of Piper's two-facedness isn't convincing, her moments of sincerity invite genuine empathy. Cornelia also yields narrative time to Dev, a precocious teenager whose father is missing and whose mother develops a friendship with Cornelia. Dev's connection to the story is initially unclear, though he does grow close to Clare, a troubled teenager with an unconventional connection to Cornelia, and a late-breaking development grounds his role more firmly. Though each story line is a good read on its own, they don't always braid nicely, and while the predictable plot wanders into sappiness, the prose is polished and the suburban travails are familiar enough that fans of the women's fiction and higher-brow mommy lit will relate.(May)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Leslie lives with a father who has given up on life, a drug-abusing brother who allowed his dealer to rape Leslie in lieu of payment, and a burning desire to banish pain and fear from her life. Unable to confide in her best friend, Aislinn, she devotes herself to working to pay the family bills and to get the tattoo she believes will help her reclaim her body. What she doesn't know is that the art she has selected will bind her to Irial, the king of the Dark Court of Fairy. He removes her emotions like fear, panic, or anger, and uses them to nourish the fairies of his court. What Irial doesn't expect is his growing love for Leslie and her desire to make her own choices. In Leslie, Marr has created a damaged, wounded character who still comes across as being incredibly strong. Irial needs to care for his court, knowing them too weak to win a war, but his feelings for Leslie make him unwilling to do what needs to be done. The lesser characters are also well drawn: Rabbit the tattoo artist, his father, Gabriel, and also Aislinn, Keenan, and Seth fromWicked Lovely.

The precocious brother and sister uncover a secret government plot to use &#x201C;YAGs,&#x201D; or Young American Geniuses, to solve the complex problems of the nation, and find that they are on the list. Suddenly, their 3,000-mile road trip becomes a lot more exciting. The McDonalds&#x2019; trek across the U.S. includes stops at the Donner Party Memorial, a museum of PEZ memorabilia, and the world&#x2019;s largest ball of twine, all while being pursued by dangerous &#x201C;dudes with bowler hats.&#x201D; Although the interjection of factual information from their college-professor father is a bit forced at times, Gutman&#x2019;s novel offers a quirky look at Americana that will engage curious minds. Frequent sidebars direct readers to Google Maps to track the twins&#x2019; journey, and occasional photos of the attractions add appeal. Those looking for a fun and suspenseful read similar to those from Pseudonymous Bosch will not be disappointed. Grades 5-8. --Erin Anderson",

        "0061991066": "In this sequel to The Blood Gospel (2013), archaeologist Erin Granger receives a message from Cardinal Bernard, leader of the Order of Sanguines, a group of vampires operating within the Vatican, whose thirst for human blood is kept in check by the blood of Christ. The message leads Erin back into the ancient war between the Sanguines and the Strigoi, a rival group of vampires whose interests lie in a more evil direction than the Sanguines&#x2019;. Now a new villain has surfaced, a man who calls himself Judas Iscariot&#x2014;and who may indeed be the biblical Judas. To save the world from Armageddon, Erin reluctantly joins forces with another entity whose evil nature is not to be trifled with. This collaboration between Rollins, the well-known author of the Sigma Force thrillers (contemporary stories with ties to ancient riddles), and Cantrell, author of the atmospheric Hannah Vogel mysteries (set in Berlin in the 1930s), should appeal to their fans, but also to readers who like an action-packed, epic-size story portraying the battle between Good and Evil. --David Pitt",
        "0061236829": "Starred Review. At the beginning of Oates's 36th novel, Rebecca Schwart is mistaken by a seemingly harmless man for another woman, Hazel Jones, on a footpath in 1959 Chatauqua Falls, N.Y. Five hundred pages later, Rebecca will find out that the man who accosted her is a serial killer, and Oates will have exercised, in a manner very difficult to forget, two of her recurring themes: the provisionality of identity and the awful suddenness of male violence. There's plenty of backstory, told in retrospect. Rebecca's parents escape from the Nazis with their two sons in 1936; Rebecca is born in the boat crossing over. When Rebecca is 13, her father, Jacob, a sexton in Milburn, N.Y., kills her mother, Anna, and nearly kills Rebecca, before blowing his own head off. At the time of the footpath crossing, Rebecca is just weeks away from being beaten, almost to death, by her husband, Niles Tignor (a shady traveling beer salesman). She and son Niley flee; she takes the name of the woman for whom she has been recently mistaken and becomes Hazel Jones. Niley, a nine-year-old with a musical gift, becomes Zacharias, \"a name from the bible,\" Rebecca tells people. Rebecca's Hazel navigates American norms as a waitress, salesperson and finally common-law wife of the heir of the Gallagher media fortune, a man in whom she never confides her past. Oates is our finest novelistic tracker, following the traces of some character's flight from or toward some ultimate violence with forensic precision. There are allusions here to the mythic scouts of James Fenimore Cooper'sLeatherstocking Tales, who explored the same New York territory when it was primeval woods. Many of the passages are a lot like a blown-up photo of a bruise&mdash;ugly without seeming to have a point. Yet the traumatic pattern of the hunter and the hunted, unfolded in Rebecca/Hazel's lifelong escape, never cripples Hazel: she is liberated, made crafty, deepened by her ultimately successful flight. Like Theodore Dreiser, Oates wears out objections with her characters, drawn in an explosive vernacular. Everything in this book depends on Oates' ability to bring a woman before the reader who is deeply veiled&mdash;whose real name is unknown even to herself&mdash;and she does it with epic panache.(June)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0061059056": "What could more genuinely embody the spirit of Christmas (or Hogswatch, on the Discworld) than a Terry Pratchett book about the holiday season?  Every secular Christmas tradition is included.  But as thisisthe 21st Discworld novel, there are some unusual twists.This year the Auditors, who want people to stop believing in things that aren't real, have hired an assassin to eliminate the Hogfather. (You know him: red robe, white beard, says, \"Ho, ho, ho!\") Their evil plot will destroy the Discworld unless someone covers for him.  So someone does. Well, at least Deathtries.  He wears the costume and rides the sleigh drawn by four jolly pigs: Gouger, Tusker, Rooter, and Snouter.  He even comes down chimneys.  But as fans of other Pratchett stories about Death (Mort,Reaper Man, andSoul Music) know, he takes things literally. He gives children whatever they wish for and appears in person at Crumley's in The Maul.Fans will welcome back Susan, Death of Rats (the Grim Squeaker), Albert, and the wizardly faculty of Unseen University, and revel in new personalities like Bilious, the \"oh god of Hangovers.\"  But you needn't have read Pratchett before to laugh uproariously and think seriously about the meanings of Christmas.--Nona Vero--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

Saudi Arabia, which our soldiers have defended with their lives, funds 90 percent of the world's Islamic fundamentalism.

By hiring our own political leaders, as soon as they leave office, to lobby for them to rip us off. Former House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt, for example, sits on the board of an American affiliate of a Chinese company that has been denied the right to operate in the United States because it steals our technology. Former House Republican Appropriations Committee chairman Bob Livingstone represented Libya until just before Gaddafi fell. And we have a president who willingly obliges countries that poach on our sovereignty, refusing to stand up for our interests and our jobs as they confiscate half the royalties from our offshore energy, subject our elected leaders to criminal prosecution if they go to war without UN approval, and tell us what kind of land-use policies we should pursue.InScrewed!, bestselling authors Dick Morris and Eileen McGann lay bare the unvarnished facts as never before and suggest real, immediate, and specific steps to stop those who undermine our interests and take away our jobs.

        "0060175400": "Oprah Book Club&#174; Selection, June 2000:As any reader ofThe Mosquito Coastknows, men who drag their families to far-off climes in pursuit of an Idea seldom come to any good, while those familiar withAt Play in the Fields of the LordorKalimantaanunderstand that the minute a missionary sets foot on the fictional stage, all hell is about to break loose. So when Barbara Kingsolver sends missionary Nathan Price along with his wife and four daughters off to Africa inThe Poisonwood Bible, you can be sure that salvation is the one thing they're not likely to find. The year is 1959 and the place is the Belgian Congo. Nathan, a Baptist preacher, has come to spread the Word in a remote village reachable only by airplane. To say that he and his family are woefully unprepared would be an understatement: \"We came from Bethlehem, Georgia, bearing Betty Crocker cake mixes into the jungle,\" says Leah, one of Nathan's daughters. But of course it isn't long before they discover that the tremendous humidity has rendered the mixes unusable, their clothes are unsuitable, and they've  arrived in the middle of political upheaval as the Congolese seek to wrest independence from Belgium. In addition to poisonous snakes, dangerous animals, and the hostility of the villagers to Nathan's fiery take-no-prisoners brand of Christianity, there are also rebels in the jungle and the threat of war in the air. Could things get any worse?In fact they can and they do. The first part ofThe Poisonwood Biblerevolves around Nathan's intransigent, bullying personality and his effect on both his family and the village they have come to. As political instability grows in the Congo, so does the local witch doctor's animus toward the Prices, and both seem to converge with tragic consequences about halfway through the novel. From that point on, the family is dispersed and the novel follows each member's fortune across a span of more than 30 years.The Poisonwood Bibleis arguably Barbara Kingsolver's most ambitious work, and it reveals both her great strengths and her weaknesses. As Nathan Price's wife and daughters tell their stories in alternating chapters, Kingsolver does a good job of differentiating the voices. But at times they can grate--teenage Rachel's tendency towards precious malapropisms is particularly annoying (students practice their \"French congregations\"; Nathan's refusal to take his family home is a \"tapestry of justice\"). More problematic is Kingsolver's tendency to wear her politics on her sleeve; this is particularly evident in the second half of the novel, in which she uses her characters as mouthpieces to explicate the complicated and tragic history of the Belgian Congo.Despite these weaknesses, Kingsolver's fully realized, three-dimensional characters makeThe Poisonwood Biblecompelling, especially in the first half, when Nathan Price is still at the center of the action. And in her treatment of Africa and the Africans she is at her best, exhibiting the acute perception, moral engagement, and lyrical prose that have made her previous novels so successful.--Alix Wilber",

        "006018793X": "Witness To Hope: The Biography of Pope John Paul IIby George Weigel is as comprehensive a biography of its subject as can be hoped for while the Pope still lives. Weigel, a journalist who came to the Pope's attention after the publication of his book,The Final Revolution: The Resistance Church and the Collapse of Communism, wroteWitness To Hopewith his subject's encouragement and assistance. Weigel had unprecedented access to the Pope's correspondence (with, among others, world leaders including Mikhail Gorbachev). He reports lengthy conversations with many members of the Pope's inner circle, and he occasionally reveals vivid details of the Pope's daily life (for example, at the beginning of each day, the Pope's adviser's hear moans and groaning from John Paul's solitary prayers in his private chapel).According to Weigel, the Pope told him that other biographies \"try to understand me from outside. But I can only be understood from inside.\" Unfortunately, Weigel's method for understanding the Pope \"from inside\" depends on psychological conjecture (\"It may help to begin by thinking of Karol Wojtyla as a man who grew up very fast\") and is weakened by his extreme eagerness to praise his subject (\"the man with arguably the most coherent and comprehensive vision of the human possibility in the world ahead\"). More troubling, Weigel does not ask some of the really difficult questions about this Pope--regarding his involvement with sects such as Opus Dei, for example, or the relationship between his innovative \"theology of the body\" and his conservative stance on homosexuality, or even the vicissitudes of prayer life.Witness To Hopeis a valuable book because it reports many facts that others have not reported. But for incisive analysis of this Pope's theological and political significance, or for insight into his spiritual life, readers will have to wait until the principals in his life story are free to speak more frankly with some future biographer.--Michael Joseph Gross",

But the focus here is less on Decker and his wife, Rina Lazarus, than on Gabe Whitman, the son of a friend who&#x2019;s living with them temporarily. Gabe, a 15-year-old musical prodigy, also has street smarts learned from his mobster father, Chris Donatti, that stand him in good stead when he&#x2019;s &#x201C;crowded&#x201D; and threatened by the clique called the B&amp;W Mafia. Home-schooled Gabe also falls head-over-heels in love with 14-year-old Yasmine Nourmand.

Eleonora came to me on a run through the undeveloped outskirts of Tunis. She was hazy in that first glimpse, a slight, precocious child playing backgammon with two older men. I didn&#x2019;t know anything about her&#x2014;where she lived or when, who these men were, why she was playing backgammon with them&#x2014;but I knew as soon as she came to me that I had found the protagonist of my novel. At first, I thought of her as a mix between Alice fromAlice in Wonderlandand Roald Dahl&#x2019;sMatilda. A few months later, rummaging through an antique store in Istanbul, I came across a picture of a young girl from the 1880s. When I saw this picture, everything clicked. Here was Eleonora, staring out across history with a laconic, penetrating gaze. Over the next six years, she took on a life and character of her own. Eleonora still has elements of Alice, Matilda, and the girl in the picture, but she has become her own person.Q:Would you consider the novel to be a fairy tale?Lukas:The Oracle of Stamboulis very much inspired by fairy tales. Before I began writing the third draft of the novel, I made a point of reading Maria Tartar&#x2019;s annotated version of the Brothers&#x2019; Grimm. Reading these wonderful, dark, and intimately familiar stories again&#x2014;as an adult and as a writer&#x2014;helped me understand my novel in a new way. The Brothers&#x2019; Grimm taught me the power of a single magical object and the importance of simplicity, in both plot and character. Their stories also reminded me that I wantedThe Oracle of Stamboulto be more than a fairy tale. I wanted the novel to have the wonder and familiarity of a story like &#x201C;Hansel and Gretel&#x201D; or &#x201C;Rapunzel,&#x201D; but I also wanted it to incorporate the magic of place and the sweep of history.Q:How might readers of different ages experience the book?Lukas:I hopeThe Oracle of Stamboulwill appeal to a wide range of readers: people who love reading for its power to transport, to inform, and to inspire; adults who read literary novels; and those adults who read the occasional young adult novel; precocious teenagers; those who want to learn about the Ottoman Empire or Istanbul; and anyone who wants to connect with the preternaturally intelligent child inside them. One could read the novel for Eleonora&#x2019;s story, for the sense of history, for the sense of place, or for the various historical questions I hope the book raises. And none of these readings is better than the others.Q:Who are the writers and books that have influenced you the most? What books do you think are complementary in style or mien toThe Oracle of Stamboul?Lukas:Among many others,The Oracle of Stamboulis influenced by Charles Dickens, Roald Dahl, Italo Calvino, and Gabriel Garc&#xED;a M&#xE1;rquez. During the year I started writing the book I had a lot of free time. In the period of a few months I read most of Vladimir Nabokov, John Steinbeck, James Baldwin, and Flannery O&#x2019;Connor, all writers I look to still for inspiration. I was most taken, however, by those whose work falls into the subgenre I like to call historical fabulism&#x2014;Jos&#xE9; Saramago, G&#xFC;nter Grass, and Salman Rushdie&#x2014;storytellers of the old school who add a pinch of magic to the stew of history. I was particularly moved by Saramago&#x2019;s novelThe History of the Siege of Lisbon, in which a bored proofreader literally rewrites the history of Lisbon, and by Grass&#x2019;sThe Tin Drum, in which a clairvoyant young German boy named Oskar Matzerath disrupts the traditional narrative of World War II by beating on a tin drum. How wonderful, this idea that a single act, a single person, might change the course of history.Q:You teach creative writing to third and fourth graders. What have you learned from working with them?Lukas:This past semester my students participated in National Novel Writing Month. It was kind of a crazy idea, but it worked wonderfully. One student wrote a novel about a panda who is adopted by mice. Another student wrote about a ghostly tooth fairy who is his own worst enemy. And then there was the pair who collaborated on a novel about a moldy pickle and a moldy cucumber who are best friends and want more than anything to escape the refrigerator. When I started teaching the creative writing to third and fourth graders&#x2014;through an afterschool program called Take My Word For It!&#x2014;I was going through a bit of a quarter life crisis. My students&#x2019; wide-eyed enthusiasm and seemingly-infinite imaginations helped me to regain my sense of wonder and possibility in the world. And they taught me that no idea is too crazy.",
        "006182593X": "Starred Review. Family tragedy is healed by domestic routine in this quiet, tender memoir. When his daughter Amy died suddenly at the age of 38 from an asymptomatic heart condition, journalist and novelist Rosen-blatt (Lapham Rising) and his wife moved into her house to help her husband care for their three young children. Not much happens except for the mundane, crucial duties of child care: reading stories, helping with schoolwork, chasing after an indefatigable toddler who is the busiest person I have ever known, making toast to order for finicky kids. Building on the small events of everyday life, Rosenblatt draws sharply etched portraits of his grandchildren; his stoic, gentle son-in-law; his wife, who feels slightly guilty that she is living her daughter's life; and Amy emerges as a smart, prickly, selfless figure whose significance the author never registered until her death. Rosenblatt avoids the sentimentality that might have weighed down the story; he writes with humor and an engagement with life that makes the occasional flashes of grief all the more telling. The result is a beautiful account of human loss, measured by the steady effort to fill in the void.(Feb. 16)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Having already decided to grow up to be a witch, now all Tiffany has to do is find her power. But she quickly learns that it&#x92;s not all black cats and broomsticks. According to her witchy mentor Miss Tick, \"Witches don&#x92;t use magic unless they really have to...We do other things.

        "0060936649": "In October 1946, philosopher Karl Popper arrived at Cambridge to lecture at a seminar hosted by his legendary colleague Ludwig Wittgenstein. It did not go well: the men began arguing, and eventually, Wittgenstein began waving a fire poker toward Popper. It lasted scarcely 10 minutes, yet the debate has turned into perhaps modern philosophy's most contentious encounter, largely because none of the eyewitnesses could agree on what happened. Did Wittgenstein physically threaten Popper with the poker? Did Popper lie about it afterward? BBC journalists Edmonds and Eidinow use the controversy as a springboard to probe the whys and whats of these two great thinkers, weaving biography, journalism and philosophy to produce one of the year's most entertaining and intellectually rich books. The authors show that the debate was a clash at several levels. First, of personalities: each was \"bullying, aggressive, intolerant and self-absorbed\"; in other words, accustomed to winning and unlikely to back down. Second, of class: Wittgenstein was an Austrian aristocrat, Popper was bourgeoisie (each fled Vienna to escape Hitler). And third, of ideas: Wittgenstein believed that philosophy boiled down to nothing more than a series of linguistic puzzles, while Popper thought philosophy involved real problems that immediately affected the world at large. Clearly, the stakes were high for both men in that lecture hall especially because their common mentor, the aging icon Bertrand Russell, was also in attendance. The debate thus took on the character of a succession for the throne. Tightly constructed and extraordinarily well written, this is a marvelous blend of lay and academic scholarship. It has every chance of becoming a classic of its kind. (Nov.)Forecast: Smart, general readers will gobble up this latest addition to narrative nonfiction. It will surely find a place for itself among The Professor and the Madman and An Eternal Golden Braid.Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

To start off you must prove yourself as a member of your 8-man squad, fighting for one of the PMCs. With enough experience you may even become an elite fighter or earn the right to lead a squad, platoon or ultimately an entire army of players. Can you, will you follow orders? Either way your destiny and those of 255 other fighters awaits on the battlefield ofMAG.GameplayInMAGplayers take on the role of a member of a private military corporation (PMC), in a fictional Earth future. Like most MMO games, as well as some modern shooters, the ultimate goal of action is the leveling up of your character, in this case through success in combat against other factions made up of individual online players. At the initial level players choose the PMC they will be aligned with, the physical characteristics of their character, initial available weaponry, etc. and hit the battlefield with other squad members within a persistent online environment. Along the way you will utilize a diverse skill tree to develop your character's abilities and skills at tactics and weapons using experience points that are accumulated in campaign and mission play in the name of your faction. These points are given out in various increments for all manner of action, whether that be objective completion, or individual actions in combat. Once characters reach a certain level they are eligible to take on command duties. These duties range from leading an eight-man squad, all the way to overall command of more than 100 online players. Orders are communicated and strategy developed via voice chat and other functionality. Success in command positions allows for access to special \"leadership bonuses\" that not only can improve your abilities, but also in many cases, that of the individuals and units under your command.So, how does one give orders to human individuals online?

        "0061655953": "Andrew Gross on Becoming a WriterI&rsquo;m often asked, how did you get into this trade, as my resume--an MBA from Columbia and sixteen years in the rag and sports apparel business--never exactly made a compelling case for the title:New York Timesbestselling author.But one of the great things about people writing thrillers today is that they come to their craft from disparate and compelling walks of life--lawyers, journalists, doctors, ad men, CIA operatives&mdash;and bring with them the experience of lives not spent in MFA programs and literary salons, but working amid the issues and crises that affectourworld every day.In 1996, I left my job as the head of a ski and golfwear company to take a flyer on a whim I had&mdash;well, more like an obsession. Like a million people, I had carried the lifelong urge to get out a story that was inside me, in my case a Manchurian Candidate-styled conspiracy novel calledHydraabout a political takeover of the country that featured a strong heroine. I begged my wife to grant me a year, a year without income, a year without knowing where this new path would take us, declaring I&rsquo;d earned it, deserved it. (She was a yoga teacher, so it wasn&rsquo;t too hard to get her to agree!) Of course, we both knew that writing&mdash;to say nothing of actually selling&mdash;a first novel is more difficult than you think. The year turned into two&mdash;and then three.I never thought I was being frivolous along the way. I always believed it would happen. I got some praise, and built on that, but I kept getting rejections too. Twenty-five of them from prospective agents.  Finally, one came on board. A high powered one. My first real validation!  With a ton of enthusiasmHydrawas pitched to two dozen publishers and two weeks later I had letters from all of them&mdash;all rejections again! Each seemed to contain some encouragement, but for each there was some element&mdash;the story was too political or too controversial&mdash;that got in the way. I was out of options.  I knew I would not be able to write a second one. I had a family to support. But in my heart I felt I had the chops. I had no idea what my next step in life would be.As I sat around, unsure and dismayed, I received a call&mdash;completely out of the blue, like a cheesy plot twist, except this one was real&mdash;from a woman who asked if I would take a call fromJames Patterson. Ahem!  I cleared my throat and paused a couple of seconds, so as not to convey the utter desperation my life was sinking under then, and answered, yeah, sure, I could fit him in!Thinking back twelve years, Jim wasn&rsquo;t quite the James Patterson we know now&mdash;where everything he publishes rockets straight to #1, the top selling thriller author in the country. He was a successful writer with a plan, looking to expand into multiple storylines, and one was about four dynamic women who form this bond, this koffee klatch of sorts, to share their life experiences and ultimately to solve crimes. Unbeknownst to me, my manuscriptHydrahad been handed to him by the head of his own publishing house (who originally elected to pass on it) with five words written on the cover: \"This guy does women well!!!\"  Jim read it, liked it, and most importantly,actedon it. He was looking to partner with someone. His call changed my writing life!Now maybe he had designs onThe Women's Murder Clubbecoming the second most successful crime series in fiction today (after his ownAlex Crossseries), but I didn&rsquo;t. I was just looking to scratch my way inside the circle that had been inaccessible so far, with a chance to pick up some tips from one of the best. A day later, we met for breakfast at a diner in White Plains. I bought into his vision for the characters and the story. I drove home and cranked out a couple of sample chapters and faxed them over...And the partnership lasted seven years!We did Women&rsquo;s Murder Club books set in San Francisco, a book set in the Middle Ages, one built around a Mafia trial I was a juror on, and one about art theft in Palm Beach. And when the time came for me to go out on my own, not only did I have a platform of readers who knew and hopefully loved the books we did together, and a bit of name recognition, but I felt schooled in Thriller Writing 401. I had an idea that eventually becameThe Blue Zone. It hit theNew York Timesbestseller list and sold in 23 countries. I&rsquo;ve followed that up with two other bestsellers,The Dark TideandDon&rsquo;t Look Twice.So a quick word about what I do now: I don&rsquo;t write Patterson-clones. Never intended to. But I do build on many of the techniques I learned with him, elements that I think any author can profit from, regardless of their literary ambition. Short, dramatic chapters that end on a punch and link to the one that follows. Investing your reader in the hero&rsquo;s plight within the first ten pages. Lots of twists and surprises. Start with a bang.My new thrillerRecklessbegins this way: a harrowing home break-in gone heartbreakingly wrong, leading to the suspicious deaths of larger-than-life Wall Street managers, a wealthy divorcee&rsquo;s fears that her new love is not the person he appears to be, and ultimately, to a gripping conspiracy that gives new meaning to the phrase &ldquo;too big to fail.&rdquo;  The events in it are current and happening, but it has characters you will recognize and feel you know well, and a breakneck ending you will not see coming.So I always think-- how different my life would have been if my draft ofHydrahad sold. I&rsquo;d probably be back in the apparel business now!A Q&amp;A with Andrew GrossHow did you get the idea forReckless?Like all my books, it's never one idea but a series of elements that knit together into a story line. In 2007, a horrible triple murder took place in Cheshire, Connecticut, where a an affluent surgeon's family was tortured and killed right in their country home, and it sent a chill through me and many people I know&mdash;not just the depravity of it, but the terrifying sense of violation and invasion for parents and kids who feel illusorily protected by their successful lives. That this sort of tragedy could never find their way to their door.Around a year later I was flying home from a weekend in Florida when a friend, who happened to be on the plane and sitting a row behind me, leaned forward and said&mdash;\"Bear Stearns just collapsed.\"To me, these words contained a similar profound historical importance as watching the trade towers come down, or the dismantling of the Berlin wall. A tsunami of events greater than society&rsquo;s ability to restrain it.  Something unimaginable happening before my eyes. I wanted to write a book about the sinister aspects of Wall Street as it connects to our government balanced against the personal stories of people who feel trapped and victim to events beyond their control&mdash;events they might have had a hand in making. So I combined the two events&mdash;one tragic, one stunning, the personal with the sensational, and that&rsquo;s howRecklesswas born.How has Ty Hauck&rsquo;s character changed over the past few books? What other changes do you foresee for him?Well, when I first wrote him I had no idea he&rsquo;d be with us for a while&mdash;three books. I will take a brief vacation from him on the next. What I love about Ty is that at heart he's a true romantic with his feet in the real world. He's a white knight, a true soul, in a world of questionable motives, who sees life in a simple, moral way and is willing to put himself at great risk and go up against the hegemonies of power and force that are way beyond his reach at first to penetrate or to dig out the truth. And usually it&rsquo;s a kind of \"quest\" or \"labor\" for a woman he loves. In this shifting and usually disappointing world, he is someone who doesn&rsquo;t disappoint, who you can count on to do the right thing. To me, that is very much at the heart of what being a hero in today&rsquo;s world means.Recklessis your fourth solo novel. What changes have you undergone as a writer from your first forays into fiction to this book?Well, my chapters have gotten a shade longer. But not too much so, I always fight my urges to let more texture in the books, let scenes develop more gradually with the commitment that I owe my readers a fast and gripping read. I think there is a deeper sense of personal motive in my books now than before. They&rsquo;re richer. I don&rsquo;t want to do things just for speed&mdash;as I did with Patterson or perhaps even inThe Blue Zone, which of course, has a great father/daughter dynamic which is about as \"textured\" as you can get. I&rsquo;ve pushed back against the melodramatic more&mdash;but then again&mdash;a little melodrama is always good, critics aside. I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m stumbling. Always hate to try and define my own work. It&rsquo;s better left to others to decide.Why do you write thrillers?I like to write books which engage readers with a sense of real life characters thrown into danger&mdash;I like the speed of film and the actions of heroes. And I guess I like the delivery of information in a manner that breeds suspense. So I guess I&rsquo;m a thriller guy. But I would like to write more of a generational, family story about the garment business, in the manner ofThe Godfather&mdash;if my publisher will let me one day.John Irving knows the last sentence of his novels and then works back to the beginning. What is your writing process?Well, I outline upfront. These days, about half the book, enough to get myself deep into the plot and the initial characters and to know what's at stake. And to get my publisher engaged with the next book. Then I always try to stay around ten chapters ahead of where I am. I&rsquo;m not a believer in the story leading me&mdash;mystery/thrillers have to be well thought out, like business strategies and puzzles, otherwise you can find yourself down some alleys you don&rsquo;t want to be.

        "0060781939": "If Shakespeare had written an 18th-century romantic comedy, it might look something like this novel. In her latest, veteran James offers a larger-than-life portrait of Georgian England, complete with oversexed aristocrats, posturing courtesans and a feuding duke and duchess. At the heart of it all is Roberta St. Giles, an ingenue who's intent on marrying the duke of Villiers, a chess player and notorious womanizer. Roberta, the daughter of the poetry-addicted Mad Marquess, wants nothing more than an unsentimental husband like Villiers. But in her quest to become the sort of woman who would attract the duke, she finds herself falling for Damon Reeve, her tutor in the art of pleasure. James embellishes her tale with a number of characters, each with their own desires, vices and schemes. At times, the profusion of people and plot threads overwhelms the primary romance. Roberta, in particular, pales next to the vivacious but unhappily married duchess of Beaumont, who begs for her own story. Despite this lack of focus, James pulls everything together in the final third, making for a colorful, spirited romance that will leave readers desperate for a sequel.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

And for those of you who can only think of bacon when the word \"pig\" is mentioned, prepare to go hog wild: the Volumetrics plan is designed to let you indulge in your favorite goodies every now and then, so you're much more likely to stick to the program. Developed by a nutritionist who has worked with the National Institutes of Health, theVolumetricsplan focuses on foods that are low in \"energy density.\" In other words, fruits, vegetables, and soups&#x97;all high in water content&#x97;are low in energy density, and therefore allowed in greater quantities. These foods tend to be more filling, so you eat less&#x97;and that's how easy weight loss can result. Author Barbara Rolls includes forms for charting one's daily food intake and weight-loss progress, as well as dozens of tempting recipes for the likes of Risotto Primavera and Chicken Fajita Pizza.

        "0062019740": "A prequel of sorts to Sands's paranormal comedy, Single White Vampire, this lightweight romantic romp shoots for the easy laugh and often misses. The allure of vampires lies in their strength and seeming invulnerability, but Etienne Argeneau, this book's bloodsucking hero, is curiously incompetent when it comes to dispatching a crazed mortal named Pudge who's intent on lopping his head off. Twice, Pudge manages to injure Etienne to the point where he ends up in the morgue under coroner Rachel Garrett's care. But when Rachel gets in the way of attempt number three, Etienne rescues her in the only way he knows how-by turning her into a vampire. The story moves from mildly amusing to ridiculous when Rachel, in denial, insists that she's merely having a \"wet dream\" involving a sexy man who thinks he's a vampire. There's little tension between Etienne and Rachel, sexual or otherwise. Instead, Sands stretches the plot with conflicts stemming from minor misunderstandings. Her attempts at hip dialogue also fall flat (at one point, a 200-year-old vampire compliments Rachel by saying, \"You're a happening chick, dudette!\"). Those who enjoyed Sands's previous paranormal comedy of errors may eke a little enjoyment from these pages, but this isn't something vampire fans will want to sink their teeth into.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The book went on to win both the Hugo and Nebula Awards, although a large chunk of the story had been cut out before it saw publication.  Now Haldeman and Avon Books have released the definitive version ofThe Forever War, published for the first time as Haldeman originally intended.  The book tells the timeless story of war, in this case a conflict between humanity and the alien Taurans.  Humans first bumped heads with the Taurans when we began using collapsars to travel the stars. Although the collapsars provide nearly instantaneous travel across vast distances, the relativistic speeds associated with the process means that time passes slower for those aboard ship.  For William Mandella, a physics student drafted as a soldier, that means more than 27 years will have passed between his first encounter with the Taurans and his homecoming, though he himself will have aged only a year. When Mandella finds that he can't adjust to Earth after being gone so long from home, he reenlists, only to find himself shuttled endlessly from battle to battle as the centuries pass.--Craig E.

While living beneath the Earth's surface, the D'ni practiced what they called the \"Art of Writing,\" which enabled them to create links to incredible, alternate worlds of fantastic variety called \"Ages,\" to which they could travel through \"Linking Books.\"The D'ni people thrived for thousands of years, but later met with a great catastrophe that all but ended their civilization. Their vast cavern was left uninhabited, and their Linking Books and Ages seemed lost forever.See more picturesThen, in the late 1980s, a few humans from the surface discovered that cavern.

He devoted the rest of his life to exploring and, eventually, restoring that ancient city in the D'ni cavern, preparing to one day reveal their discovery to those who were suddenly feeling irresistibly drawn to the cavern.When he passed away in 1996, his legacy was divided between a foundation that he set up and his only son, Jeff Zandi.

Also, let's not forget their lovely ward, Nefret (rescued from a desert tribe several books back), and their butler, Gargery, \"who wields a cudgel as handily as he carves a roast.\"As she has so many times before, Peters presents us with this quaint--even campy--little group of people, plops them down in an exotic Egyptian setting, and then surprises us by involving them in a story of great strength and emotion.It's 1911, and David Todros, a young Egyptian who has just married into the Peabody family, is suspected of dealing in forged antiquities, possibly to help support a rising nationalist movement. Amelia, Emerson, Ramses, and Nefret all take various actions to help David, and there are serious, dangerous consequences for everyone involved.

Scott Fitzgerald announced his decision to write &quot;somethingnew--something extraordinary and beautiful and simple + intricately patterned.&quot; That extraordinary, beautiful, intricately patterned, and above all, simple novel becameThe Great Gatsby, arguably Fitzgerald's finest work and certainly the book for which he is best known. A portrait of the Jazz Age in all of its decadence and excess,Gatsbycaptured the spirit of the author's generation and earned itself a permanent place in American mythology. Self-made, self-invented millionaire Jay Gatsby embodies some of Fitzgerald's--and his country's--most abiding obsessions: money, ambition, greed, and the promise of new beginnings. &quot;Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther.... And one fine morning--&quot; Gatsby's rise to glory and eventual fall from grace becomes a kind of cautionary tale about the American Dream.It's also a love story, of sorts, the narrative of Gatsby's quixotic passion for Daisy Buchanan. The pair meet five years before the novel begins, when Daisy is a legendary young Louisville beauty and Gatsby an impoverished officer. They fall in love, but while Gatsby serves overseas, Daisy marries the brutal, bullying, but extremely rich Tom Buchanan. After the war, Gatsby devotes himself blindly to the pursuit of wealth by whatever means--and to the pursuit of Daisy, which amounts to the same thing. &quot;Her voice is full of money,&quot; Gatsby says admiringly, in one of the novel's more famous descriptions. His millions made, Gatsby buys a mansion across Long Island Sound from Daisy's patrician East Egg address, throws lavish parties, and waits for her to appear. When she does, events unfold with all the tragic inevitability of a Greek drama, with detached, cynical neighbor Nick Carraway acting as chorus throughout.

Mariners feared they could literally sail over the edge of the world.\" In 2001, Bergreen traveled the South American strait that bears Magellan's name, and he adds to that firsthand knowledge satellite images of Magellan's route plus international archival research. His day-by-day account incorporates the testimony of sailors, Francisco Albo's pilot's log and the eyewitness accounts of Venetian scholar Antonio Pigafetta, who was on the journey. Magellan's mission for Spain was to find a water route to the fabled Spice Islands, and in 1519, the Armada de Molucca (five ships and some 260 sailors) sailed into the pages of history. Many misfortunes befell the expedition, including the brutal killing of Magellan in the Philippines. Three years later, one weather-beaten ship, \"a vessel of desolation and anguish,\" returned to Spain with a skeleton crew of 18, yet \"what a story those few survivors had to tell-a tale of mutiny, of orgies on distant shores, and of the exploration of the entire globe,\" providing proof that the world was round.

Ultimately, however, Caymen realizes that she has a love worth fighting for, and the star-crossed lovers end up together. Despite the predictable ending, the charming story is beautifully written, and the characters are well developed. Similar in feel to books by Susane Colasanti, West&#x2018;s novel is sweet and captivating.&#x2013;Candyce Pruitt-Goddard, Hartford Public Library, CT&#x3B1;(c) Copyright 2013.

        "B00006Z7HR": "What's creepier than a sinister clown? Nothing, as it turns out, which is probably why the makers ofDark Cloud 2made their evil villain a member of the circus family. After all, a clown who lifts the town's friendly mayor off his feet--with a strangle hold--is not to be messed with.Welcome to the world ofDark Cloud 2. Stylistically, it resembles a Holly Hobbie Colorforms set. All the characters are of childlike proportions, and the village's Tudor buildings seem pried from a Yorkshire hamlet. While Maximillian, the preteen hero, wanders around his hometown, Parisian accordion MIDI music serenades him. Though this is not a kid's game (it carries a Teen ESRB rating), gamers who are put off by kitschy/cute nuances should beware--this game is loaded with them.But at its heart,Dark Cloud 2is a wonderfully solid RPG. Its story has three main elements: Max's lost mother, the secret of what's going on outside the village, and why the evil clown wants Max's red stone pendant. Fighting takes place in real time, unlike the turn-based fighting in the similarFinal Fantasyseries. This was a good decision on behalf of the designers, as was the attention to weapon customizing. And if you love to manage inventory (there aren't many RPG fans that don't), this is your game. Not only can Max's weapons be upgraded, but by taking pictures and tinkering, he can create tools from scratch, in seemingly endless variations.There's so much more to this game than can be described in any review. Along the way, for example, Max meets up with Monica, a princess from the future. He may build a village using the Georama system, or he may just want to do a little fishing--to say more would be to spoil the fun, but you get the idea. You'll just have to discover it all--and there is a tremendously rich world here--on your own.--Jennifer BuckendorffPros:Multi-layered world with strong replayabilityIntuitive game controlsStrong inventory management and interesting itemsGreat, playful aspects, like Steve the \"ridepod\"Cons:Painfully slow, almost hour-long introductionSome repetitiveness in weapon upgrading and dungeon mapsHokey gestures and dialogue",
        "0060520515": "Ever wondered what the Other Woman was thinking as she stole your man? Couldn't bear to ask an old best friend if she'd ever forgiven you for absconding with her boyfriend? Itched to be a fly on your agent's office wall as she ignored your calls? Here's voyeurism at its playful, charming finest in Keyes's latest (afterSushi for Beginners;Under the Duvet; etc.). Gemma Hogan is living a lovely carefree life in Dublin when her father walks out on her mother, and she is summoned to play mom to her mom. But the magic of e-mail allows her to vent her woes to a friend in Seattle, who finds them hilarious enough to send to a top London agent, JoJo Harvey. JoJo, who is half Jessica Rabbit and half corporate powerhouse, likes Gemma's work but has bigger fish to fry-she is having a tormented affair with her married boss; her slimy co-worker is trying to beat her out for a coveted partner position; and her famed client Lily Wright, who wrote a gorgeous little cheerful fable that sold hundreds of thousands of copies, can't seem to get it together to write another book. Lily, in turn, is struggling with young motherhood, catastrophic finances and the paralyzing guilt of stealing her now-husband Anton from her former best friend, one Gemma Hogan. Keyes skillfully ties her interlocking plots together with grace and humor, and explores three disparate but gloriously real women's lives. It's a credit to Keyes that although she never exactly breaks new ground, she always serves up funny, heartwarming, believable fiction.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0060898771": "Book DescriptionTerrorist attacks. Natural disasters. Domestic crackdowns. Economic collapse. Riots. Wars. Disease. Starvation.What can you do when it all hits the fan?You can learn to be self-sufficient and survive without the system.**I've started to look at the world through apocalypse eyes.** So begins Neil Strauss's harrowing new book: his first full-length worksince the international bestsellerThe Game, and one of the most original-and provocative-narratives of the year.After the last few years of violence and terror, of ethnic and religious hatred, of tsunamis and hurricanes&ndash;and now of world financial meltdown&ndash;Strauss, like most of his generation, came to the sobering realization that, even in America, anything can happen. But rather than watch helplessly, he decided to do something about it. And so he spent three years traveling through a country that's lost its sense of safety, equipping himself with the tools necessary to save himself and his loved ones from an uncertain future.With the same quick wit and eye for cultural trends that markedThe Game, The Dirt,andHow to Make Love Like a Porn Star, Emergencytraces Neil's white-knuckled journey through today's heart of darkness, as he sets out to move his life offshore, test his skills in the wild, and remake himself as a gun-toting, plane-flying, government-defying survivor. It's a tale of paranoid fantasies and crippling doubts, of shady lawyers and dangerous cult leaders, of billionaire gun nuts and survivalist superheroes, of weirdos, heroes, and ordinary citizens going off the grid.It's one man's story of a dangerous world&ndash;and how to stay alive in it.Before the next disaster strikes, you're going to want to read this book. And you'll want to do everything it suggests. Because tomorrow doesn't come with a guarantee...Questions for Neil StraussAmazon.com:What initially inspired you to writeEmergency?Strauss:It happened over the last eight years, watching as everything that we thought could never happen in America suddenly started happening. So I decided to take control over my own life, rather than being dependent on an increasingly undependable system, and worked toward becoming as self-sufficient, independent, skilled, and experienced as I could. That journey continues today.Amazon.com:You use the term \"Fliesian\" in the book (as inLord of the Flies). What is a Fliesian?Strauss:Someone who believes that people, if put in a world where there are no consequences to their actions, will do horrible things.Amazon.com:So how can we hold on to our kindness and humaneness in a crisis?Strauss:Fortunately, in my experience, it is precisely these situations when you see the best in people come out. The worst in some tends to arise only when the resources one needs to survive are scarce and there is competition for them.Amazon.com:Do you think that this book is catering to a fear-based culture?Strauss:Actually, the book is less about spreading fears than getting over them. What most of us fear is the unknown, and we fret about what&#x2019;s going to happen in an uncertain future when we consider the calamities of the past. I decided to no longer react to the things I read in newspapers, but instead to understand them. So I took each worst-case scenario to the extreme, and experienced many of the things that used to make me anxious. I guess, in that way, it was like a more interesting, adventurous Prozac.Amazon.com:A lot of writers these days are basing books on various year-long stunts: read the encyclopedia for a year, always say \"yes\" for a year, have sex with your wife every day for a year. But your brand of immersion journalism, inEmergencyand inThe Game, is more open-ended--and more personal--than that. Do you draw any sort of line between the books and your life?Strauss:My books never begin as books. They usually begin as some sort of lack I recognize in my life and try to fix with the help of the most qualified experts I can find. Often, these people are not in the public eye, but hidden in a splinter subculture. And while I&#x2019;m trying to get taken under their wing, I realize at some point I&#x2019;m spending so much time trying to learn and improve that I might as well have something to show for it, so I write a book.Amazon.com:One of the first subcultures you embedded yourself in was a cabal of billionaires. Are wealthy people safer than the rest of us?Strauss:No, they&#x2019;re more scared than the rest of us. That&#x2019;s why they&#x2019;re taking so many precautionary measures. They are defined by their money, and now that identity is crumbling around them. You can&#x2019;t buy safety. Those who are the most safe are the ones with knowledge, skills, and experience.Amazon.com:You describe the philosophy of the sphincter inEmergency. What is that?Strauss:I learned that from one of my defense instructors. The basic idea is that, in a high-pressure situation, the first thing that happens is people get nervous and uptight. And as soon as your sphincter tightens, as the metaphor goes, it cuts off circulation to your brain. So one of the best survival skills you can have is the ability to quickly and coolly assess a situation rather than panicking and doing something stupid.Amazon.com:From your wilderness survival training, it sounds like you're in pretty good shape if things ever hit the fan. But what if you live in the city?Strauss:That&#x2019;s a good point. A lot of the wilderness survival skills I learned don&#x2019;t take into account that, in America today, there&#x2019;s little actual wilderness left. So I took a class called Urban Escape and Evasion. As the teacher put it, &#x201C;Once you learn lockpicking, the world is your oyster.&#x201D; He also taught car hot-wiring, evading pursuit vehicles, and, as an exam, handcuffed me, put me in a trunk, and told me I had to escape. It was one of the most interesting classes I&#x2019;d taken in my life. If I&#x2019;d known these skills in high school, I definitely would have been expelled.Amazon.com:The book has a surprising trajectory--surprising to the reader and I think to you as well. You start out looking for a way to get out of Dodge if one of many possible disasters strikes, but as you develop your survival skills, instead of becoming a lone wolf in the woods, you start becoming tied to your community, as an EMT and a trained crisis management worker (not to mention a goat midwife). It's actually pretty heartwarming. Did you see any of that coming?Strauss:Definitely not. I had no idea that when disasters happen now, instead of running away from them, I&#x2019;d be running toward them and trying to be of some use to the community. I think that, if there&#x2019;s a silver lining in the dark cloud that is the economy right now, it&#x2019;s that hard times bring people closer together. Now is the time to get to know your neighbors. You never know when you may need them.Amazon.com:Has your experience writingEmergencyaffected you differently from your experience writingThe Game?Strauss:Yes, because now, at 3 a.m. on a Saturday night, my search-and-rescue pager will go off and I&#x2019;ll have to stop doing what I learned inThe Gameand start doing what I learned inEmergency.",

When an attractive male colleague, Angus Holt, convinces Nat to accompany him on a teaching assignment at a nearby prison, a sudden riot puts them both in peril. Nat finds herself desperately attempting to save the life of a guard, apparently stabbed by an inmate during the fracas. The dying man asks her to pass on his last words to his wife, but possessing knowledge of this cryptic message proves dangerous. Nat finds herself accused of murder and must evade the law while also tracking down the bad guys. Her methods more often resemble that of Nancy Drew than an Ivy League professor, and the plot suffers by comparison with Peter Abrahams's grittyEnd of Story(2006), which makes better use of a similar theme.11-city author tour.

Against his will. After all, \"boys don't write poetry.  Girls do.\" What does he say of the famous poem \"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy  Evening\"? \"I think Mr. Robert Frost / has a little / too / much / time / on his  / hands.\" As his teacher, Ms. Stretchberry, introduces the canon to the class,  however, he starts to see the light. Poetry is not so bad, it's not just for  girls, and it's not even that hard to write. Take William Carlos Williams, for  example: \"If that is a poem / about the red wheelbarrow / and the white chickens  / then any words / can be a poem. / You've just got to / make / short / lines.\"  He becomes more and more discerning as the days go by, and readers' spirits will  rise with Jack's as he begins to find his own voice through his own poetry and  through that of others. His favorite poem of all is a short, rhythmic one by  Walter Dean Myers called \"Love That Boy\" (included at the end of the book with  all the rest of Ms. Stretchberry's assignments). The words completely captivate  him, reminding him of the loving way his dad calls him in the morning and of the  way he used to call his yellow dog, Sky. Jack's reverence for the poem  ultimately leads to meeting the poet himself, an experience he will never  forget.This winning, accessible book is truly remarkable in that Creech lets us witness  firsthand how words can open doors to the soul.

Their tyranny is opposed by retired god Sam, who mocks the Celestial City, introduces Buddhism to subvert Hindu dogma, allies himself with the planet's native \"demons\" against Heaven, fights pyrotechnic battles with bizarre troops and weapons, plays dirty with politics and poison, and dies horribly but won't stay dead.

Called a \"divine substance\" by Homer, salt is an essential part of the human body, was one of the first international commodities and was often used as currency throughout the developing world. Kurlansky traces the history of salt's influences from prehistoric China and ancient Africa (in Egypt they made mummies using salt) to Europe (in 12th-century Provence, France, salt merchants built \"a system of solar evaporation ponds\") and the Americas, through chapters with intriguing titles like \"A Discourse on Salt, Cadavers and Pungent Sauces.\" The book is populated with characters as diverse as frozen-food giant Clarence Birdseye; Gandhi, who broke the British salt law that forbade salt production in India because it outdid the British salt trade; and New York City's sturgeon king, Barney Greengrass.

Even companies committed to \"jabbing\"&#8212;creating content for consumers and engaging with customers to build relationships&#8212;still desperately want to land the powerful, bruising swing that will knock out their opponents or their customers' resistance in one tooth-shattering, killer blow. Right hooks, after all, convert traffic to sales. They easily show results and return on investment. Except when they don't.In the same passionate, streetwise style his readers have come to expect, Vaynerchuk is on a mission to strengthen marketers' right hooks by changing the way they fight to make their consumers happy, and ultimately to compete. Thanks to the massive change in and proliferation of social media platforms in the last four years, the winning combination of jabs and right hooks is different now. Communication is still key, but context matters more than ever. It's not just about developing high-quality content; it's also about developing high-quality content that's perfectly adapted to specific social media platforms and mobile devices. It's about truly engaging with customers, not by shouting at them over social media but by using new narrative forms particular to each different media platform&#8212;especially, though not exclusively, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Twitter, and Tumblr.Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hookis a blueprint to social media marketing strategies that really work.",

        "006019491X": "Oprah Book Club&#174; Selection, February 2000:Until Isabel Allende burst onto the scene with her 1985 debut,The House of the Spirits, Latin American fiction was, for the most part, a boys' club comprising such heavy hitters as Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez, Jorge Luis Borges, and Mario Vargas Llosa.  But the Chilean Allende shouldered her way in with her magical realist multi-generational tale of the Trueba family, followed it up with four more novels and a spate of nonfiction, and has remained in a place of honor ever since. Her sixth work of fiction,Daughter of Fortune, shares some characteristics with her earlier works: the canvas is wide, the characters are multi-generational and multi-ethnic, and the protagonist is an unconventional woman who overcomes enormous obstacles to make her way in the world. Yet one cannot accuse Allende of telling the same story twice; set in the mid-1800s, this novel follows the fortunes of Eliza Sommers, Chilean by birth but adopted by a British spinster, Rose Sommers, and her bachelor brother, Jeremy, after she is abandoned on their doorstep.\"You have English blood, like us,\" Miss Rose assured Eliza when she was old enough to understand. \"Only someone from the British colony would have thought to leave you in a basket on the doorstep of the British Import and Export Company, Limited. I am sure they knew how good-hearted my brother Jeremy is, and felt sure he would take you in. In those days I was longing to have a child, and you fell into my arms, sent by God to be brought up in the solid principles of the Protestant faith and the English language.\"The family servant, Mama Fresia, has a different point of view, however: \"You, English? Don't get any ideas, child. You have Indian hair, like mine.\" And certainly Eliza's almost mystical ability to recall all the events of her life would seem to stem more from the Indian than the Protestant side.As Eliza grows up, she becomes less tractable, and when she falls in love with Joachin Andieta, a clerk in Jeremy's firm, her adoptive family is horrified. They are even more so when a now-pregnant Eliza follows her lover to California where he has gone to make his fortune in the 1849 gold rush. Along the way Eliza meets Tao Chi'en, a Chinese doctor who saves her life and becomes her closest friend. What starts out as a search for a lost love becomes, over time, the discovery of self; and by the time Eliza finally catches up with the elusive Joachin, she is no longer sure she still wants what she once wished for.  Allende peoples her novel with a host of colorful secondary characters. She even takes the narrative as far afield as China, providing an intimate portrait of Tao Chi'en's past before returning to 19th-century San Francisco, where he and Eliza eventually fetch up. Readers with a taste for the epic, the picaresque, and romance that is satisfyingly complex will find them all inDaughter of Fortune.--Margaret Prior",

In Raiden's case it was a victory over Shao Kahn, while Superman bested Darkseid. These occurred at the exact same time and involved inter-dimensional elements, which somehow merged their two enemies into one being, Dark Kahn, while allowing the characters of the two universes to interact. In this merging the powers of the heroes and villains are scrambled as well, making some stronger than they ever were, and leaving others vulnerable for the first time in their lives, allowing each to battle on more or less equal footing. And battle they do without realizing that the uncontrollable rage that they feel for each other is actually the work of Dark Khan.GameplayMortal Kombat vs. DC Universebeing a fighter, gameplay consists of one-on-one battles, both in local play and online, in which players can choose a character from either side who will face off against a counterpart from the other. Each character has unique attacks and special finishing moves, and fighting arenas vary depending on whether your character comes from theMortal Kombator DC universe. Keeping with the reputation for brutality in theMortal Kombatfranchise, characters from this side will have access to fatalities, while the historically less overly violent DC Comics characters will execute \"heroic brutalities,\" which are end moves where the opponent while beaten, is not killed. The game also features new gameplay mechanics such as: Freefall Kombat, in which players can engage in extended combat while in midair; Klose Kombat, during which the play angle moves to a close-up view of the action; The \"Test Your Might\" mini-game where you smash your opponent through walls; and Rage Mode, which increases the power of a character's attack by 50% and provides protection against being stunned by an opponent.Playable CharactersPlayable characters inMortal Kombat vs. DC Universeconsist of some of the most popular heroes and villains from both universes, with most being available from the beginning of the game and some unlockable throughout.

        "006112429X": "A number of fictional attempts have been made to portray what might lead a teenager to kill a number of schoolmates or teachers, Columbine style, but Shriver's is the most triumphantly accomplished by far. A gifted journalist as well as the author of seven novels, she  brings to her story a keen understanding of the intricacies of marital and parental relationships as well as a narrative pace that is both compelling and thoughtful. Eva Khatchadourian is a smart, skeptical New Yorker whose impulsive marriage to Franklin, a much more conventional person, bears fruit, to her surprise and confessed disquiet, in baby Kevin. From the start Eva is ambivalent about him, never sure if she really wanted a child, and he is balefully hostile toward her; only good-old-boy Franklin, hoping for the best, manages to overlook his son's faults as he grows older, a largely silent, cynical, often malevolent child. The later birth of a sister who is his opposite in every way, deeply affectionate and fragile, does nothing to help, and Eva always suspects his role in an accident that befalls little Celia. The narrative, which leads with quickening and horrifying inevitability to the moment when Kevin massacres seven of his schoolmates and a teacher at his upstate New York high school, is told as a series of letters from Eva to an apparently estranged Franklin, after Kevin has been put in a prison for juvenile offenders. This seems a gimmicky way to tell the story, but is in fact surprisingly effective in its picture of an affectionate couple who are poles apart, and enables Shriver to pull off a huge and crushing shock far into her tale. It's a harrowing, psychologically astute, sometimes even darkly humorous novel, with a clear-eyed, hard-won ending and a tough-minded sense of the difficult, often painful human enterprise.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to theHardcoveredition.",

        "0064409406": "Grade 4-7-British narrator Alex Jennings does a smashing job with C. S. Lewis' delightful classic (HarperCollins Children's, 1994), the third story in the Narnia series. The tale begins with a poor slave boy named Shasta escaping from his adopted fisherman father who plans to sell him to a brutish stranger. A dignified talking war horse named Bree helps Shasta flee. Jennings plays Shasta with refreshing gentleness-listeners get a sense of the boy's sensitivity and fear as he embarks on the adventure of his life. The talented narrator plays Bree with the right amount of dignity and haughtiness. This horse amuses with his witty observations about human behavior, and sense of equine superiority. The horse and his boy hope to travel north to Narnia, and encounter numerous adventures and strange characters, all beautifully portrayed by Jennings. The most memorable supporting characters are another escaped child, a tough girl named Aravis, and her talking mare called Hwin. Jennings brings these two adventure seekers to life with his crystal clear narration. Thanks to his skills as a storyteller, the action moves rapidly from one exciting episode to the next. Evocative music plays at the beginning and end of each side of the tape. This presentation will enchant young listeners and encourage them to read the other titles in the series. It is helpful for students to have read The Magician's Nephew and The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe before enjoying this, but The Horse and the Boy stands alone as enthralling, self-contained entertainment.Brian E.

        "0060722282": "Oates is not only on her authentically rendered home ground in this sprawling novel set in the city of Niagara Falls during the 1950s, she is also writing at the top of her form. Her febrile prose is especially appropriate to a story as turbulent as the tumultuous waters that have claimed many lives over the years. Widowed on her wedding night when her new husband, a young minister and latent homosexual, throws himself into the falls, Ariah Littrell, the plain, awkward daughter of a minister, henceforth considers herself damned. Her bleak future becomes miraculously bright when Dirk Burnaby, a handsome, wealthy bon vivant with an altruistic heart, falls in love with the media-dubbed Widow-Bride. Their rapturous happiness is shadowed only by Ariah's illogical conviction over the years that Dirk will leave her and their three children someday. Her unreasonable fear becomes self-fulfilling when her increasingly unstable behavior, combined with Dirk's obsessed but chaste involvement with Nina Olshaker, a young mother who enlists his help in alerting the city fathers to the pestilential conditions in the area later to be known as Love Canal, opens a chasm in their marriage. His gentle heart inspired by a need for justice, Dirk takes on the powerful, corrupt politicians, his former peers and pals, in a disastrous lawsuit that ruins him socially and financially and results in his death. Oates adroitly addresses the material of this \"first\" class action lawsuit and makes the story fresh and immediate. \"In the end, all drama is about family,\" a character muses, and while the narrative occasionally lapses into melodrama in elucidating this theme, Oates spins a haunting story in which nature and humans are equally rapacious and self-destructive.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Li Lan prefers to rebuff the unusual offer despite its implications of good social standing and financial rescue for her money-strapped family. But when her dreams are brusquely invaded by the rather unsavory dead man, Lim Tian Ching, she realizes she may already be in over her head. Her dead suitor&#x2019;s living cousin, Tian Bai, now the family heir, further complicates matters as Li Lan wrestles with her very real attraction to him. As the angry ghost becomes more possessive in her dreams, and his family more demanding that she marry him, Li Lan&#x2019;s involvement with the Lim family becomes even murkier and potentially dangerous. With its gripping tangles of plot and engaging characters, this truly compelling read is sure to garner much well-deserved attention. --Julie Trevelyan",
        "0062195379": "Inspector Avraham &#x201C;Avi&#x201D; Avraham is a veteran cop in Holon, a quiet suburb of Tel Aviv. Experience tells him that crime in Holon is pretty simple: no serial killers, and murder and rape are rare. So, when a distraught mother reports that her 16-year-old son didn&#x2019;t return from school, Avi assures her that the boy will turn up. But he doesn&#x2019;t, and Avi, a man filled with self-doubt and perhaps numbed by his town&#x2019;s lack of unusual crime, agonizes as the investigation lurches on. A primary source of his discomfort is a high-school teacher who had previously tutored the missing boy and proceeds to insert himself into the investigation in a way that seems inexplicable. The sense of place here is fascinating (Tel Aviv&#x2019;s suburbs seem both familiar and exotic), and the focus on Avi&#x2019;s state of mind, which is plumbed continuously, brings psychological depth. Procedural details are intriguing, too, suggesting that policing, at least in Holon, is a more humane enterprise than in the U.S. Armchair-traveler crime aficionados will welcome Mishani&#x2019;s debut and look forward to Avi&#x2019;s return. --Thomas Gaughan",
        "0007388160": "Early one morning in February 2008, Oates drove her husband, Raymond Smith, to the Princeton Medical Center where he was admitted with pneumonia. There, he developed a virulent opportunistic infection and died just one week later. Suddenly and unexpectedly alone, Oates staggered through her days and nights trying desperately just to survive Smith's death and the terrifying loneliness that his death brought. In her typically probing fashion, Oates navigates her way through the choppy waters of widowhood, at first refusing to accept her new identity as a widow. She wonders if there is a perspective from which the widow's grief is sheer vanity, this pretense that one's loss is so very special that there has never been a loss quite like it. In the end, Oates finds meaning, much like many of Tolstoy's characters, in the small acts that make up and sustain ordinary life. When she finds an earring she thought she'd lost in a garbage can that raccoons have overturned, she reflects, \"If I have lost the meaning of my life, and the love of my life, I might still find small treasured things amid the spilled and pilfered trash.\" At times overly self-conscious, Oates nevertheless shines a bright light in every corner in her soul-searing memoir of widowhood.

        "0062184849": "*Starred Review* For generations, the wealthy Porter family has sought refuge in its vacation home at Ashaunt Point along Massachusetts&#x2019; rocky coastline. It&#x2019;s a place where Helen and her siblings can run wild and free under the watchful eye of Bea and her fellow coterie of Scottish caregivers. All is well until WWII erupts and an army outpost is installed nearby. Soldiers lure Helen to dances, seduce Bea into a hasty romance, and rob Helen&#x2019;s sister Jane of her innocence.  Then word comes that her brother has been killed in action, and the world can no longer be held at bay. When Helen returns decades later as a young wife and mother, she tries to re-create Ashaunt&#x2019;s former simplicity for her emotionally fragile son, but the Vietnam war and the counterculture take their toll. At the end of her life, as cancer ravages her body, Helen finds Ashaunt equally threatened by environmental disasters and encroaching development, and the outrage becomes too much to bear. With a style and voice reminiscent of William Trevor and Graham Swift, Graver&#x2019;s powerfully evocative portrait of a family strained by events both large and small celebrates the indelible influence certain places can exert over the people who love them. --Carol Haggas",
        "B000HKP88C": "What does the American Dream mean today?For Niko Bellic, fresh off the boat from Europe, it is the hope he can escape his past. For his cousin, Roman, it is the vision that together they can find fortune in Liberty City, gateway to the land of opportunity. As they slip into debt and are dragged into a criminal underworld by a series of shysters, thieves and sociopaths, they discover that the reality is very different from the dream in a city that worships money and status, and is heaven for those who have them and a living nightmare for those who don&#146;t.Beginning with the 1997 release of the originalGrand Theft Auto, theGTAseries has been one of the most prolific, controversial and down right entertaining franchises in video games history. This pedigree of success guarantees that the highly anticipated eleventh game in the series,Grand Theft Auto IV, will garner at least as much attention if not more.Return to Liberty City.The dream as Niko expected it.View larger.There's always a catch.View larger.But some skills are international.View larger.The PlotGrand Theft Auto IVis a brand new adventure in theGTAuniverse following the experiences of Nikolai \"Niko\" Bellic, a new immigrant from an undisclosed eastern European country whose troubled pa st and the persuasion of his cousin Roman have brought him to the fictional Liberty City. Unfortunately, Niko&#146;s search for the American Dream and a much needed fresh start, hits an immediate snag when the rags to riches story Roman spun to pique Niko's interest is exposed as not only a complete fabrication, but a ploy to enlist Niko&#146;s well-known skills as a tough guy against the ample list of enemies clamoring for Roman&#146;s debt-ridden blood.Because Roman is the only person Niko knows in Liberty City he begrudgingly accepts his role as Roman&#146;s protector despite the deception. But as time goes on Niko comes into his own, and his experience on the wrong side of the tracks proves more valuable than he could have ever imagined as he fights for survival and later supremacy on the crime ridden streets of Liberty City.Game EnvironmentsBased on several of the boroughs of New York City and parts of New Jersey, Liberty City, familiar to players of previous games in the series, has been entirely redesigned forGTA IV. Players can expect visible detail down to the weeds growing in the cracks in the sidewalk, cars and buildings of visibly different ages and a much greater level if verticality in the buildings and bridges that they are able to explore as Niko moves through the city streets. In addition, pedestrians inGTA IVare much more realistic. No longer simply moving cardboard cutouts, these NPCs are intelligent, modern, human representations that laugh, cry, eat, drink, use cell phones and ATMs, and talking amongst themselves regardless of Niko&#146;s interaction with them.GameplayHistoricallyGTAgames have focused heavily on mission-based play, requiring successful completion of fixed tasks in order for players to progress through the game, but this has changed to a great extent inGTA IV. Players will experience an entirely new and exciting emphasis centered on the blending of on-mission and off-mission play, resulting not only in an increased sense of realism, but more interesting and unrestricted gameplay.FeaturesAside from the car jacking and a detailed city environment here are the new features forGTA IV:Improved combat system - Now you can use cover and also a target lock system, which allows you to take out targets with greater ease and accuracy. Plus, you can engage in some hand-to-hand combat if you can't get your hands on a piece quick enough.Cell phone - Not just for basic phone calls anymore. Use your in-game cell phone to receive missions via SMS, snap photos, and ZiT (tag) songs that can be downloaded exclusively on Amazon.com/mp3.Free time - In between missions you can take advantage of \"me\" time. There are gentleman's clubs, comedy clubs, bowling alleys, and bars, which all house unique activities.Take a break from the storyline - A variety of side missions allow you to help run a car service, \"borrow\" cop cars, assassinate targets, help solve problems for those on the street, or take to the air with stunt jumps that are scattered all over the city.Control your own fate - Throughout the game choice moments will arrive causing you to make a decision that will affect relationships and money.MultiplayerGive Niko a rest and create your own multiplayer \"hero.\"GTAhas added multiplayer modes allowing you to take your creation out to play online in competitive, co-op, and free form modes. Competitive mode has you fighting against the cops, jacking cars, or racing to finish odd jobs. Co-op challenges you and your friends with various tasks including Hangman's NOOSE where you are responsible for escorting a wanted kingpin to a safe extraction point. Freeform lets you and 15 others lose on Liberty City. Use this mode to hit up the bar and play virtual darts versus each other or head out to the streets and set up your own drag races. If you can dream it, you can do it in Freeform mode.ZiT: We'll Spot The Song For YouWhen playing Grand Theft Auto IV, if you hear a song that you are interested in buying as an MP3, all you have to do is dial ZiT-555-0100 on your in-game mobile phone and a text message will be sent to you with the name of the artist and the title of the track. The next time you log in at theRockstar Games Social Club, you will find 30-second previews of all the songs you have ZiT'ed while playing the game. You can add them to your basket there and click to purchase at Amazon MP3, or you can find them all atwww.amazon.com/gtamusic.",

        "0060507322": "Drugs, sex and groupies abound in this book by Pearlman, a reporter forNewsday. Only the author isn't a rock critic chronicling the wild escapades of a band; he's describing the very successful 1986 season when the New York Mets won the World Series. As remarkable as the team's performance on the field, the players' escapades outside the stadium are perhaps more memorable, in a far less flattering way. Pearlman, an unabashed Mets fan, offers a behind-the-scenes look at the team, including an insightful portrait of Frank Cashen, the general manager at the time. Pearlman discusses the trades, the players' abilities and unforgettable games. But much of the book is about the difficulties and the unprofessional behavior of many of the players. For example, on one rowdy flight back to New York, United Airlines billed the team an additional $7,500 for damage resulting from food fights and other unruly antics and said the team couldn't fly the airline again. Cashen was upset, but the manager, Davey Johnson, laughed as he tore up the bill in front of the team. The drug use that would become public later was not addressed at the time, though it was obvious to reporters. When asked whether Dwight Gooden was healthy, despite several minor car accidents, Johnson had nothing to say: \"As long as Dwight Gooden was smiling and in good physical shape, Johnson required no knowledge about the pitcher's private time. Johnson was a manager, not a babysitter.\" Pearlman's book isn't simple nostalgia-some of the players have virtually disappeared from the public eye-and much of the wild off-field behavior is still part of the game today. Baseball aficionados, especially Mets fans, will enjoy this affectionate but critical look at this exciting season.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0060531126": "This thoroughly readable popular history of the War of 1812 may exaggerate in its claim that the war forged America&#x92;s national identity; after all, there were enough regional identities left lying around after the conflict to cause a national civil war. But otherwise it&#x92;s a fine narrative history that traces the major of events of the war, from the preliminary plots by James Wilkinson and Aaron Burr that revealed the ambitions of Westerners for territorial expansion, through New England&#x92;s secessionist Hartford Convention to the Battle of New Orleans, which wrapped up the war in 1815. Borneman makes clear that the performance of the American army was mostly disgraceful, that the Canadians can pat themselves on the back for courage and endurance and that the decisive victory of the American navy was not the famous frigate duels but the Battle of Lake Champlain in 1814. Borneman (Alaska: Saga of a Bold Land) is also strong in vivid personal portraits (the gigantic Winfield Scott and the diminutive and sickly James Madison) and evenhanded as far as atrocities (too many, by all parties) are concerned.

Instead, Lilly defies her family&#x2019;s stifling expectations by moving to London, where eventually she joins the Women&#x2019;s Army Auxiliary Corps and becomes an ambulance driver in a refreshing change of pace from the more usual female occupation of nursing. Strongly on Lilly&#x2019;s mind is Robert Fraser, a friend of her brother&#x2019;s and the one man who makes her heart flutter. Despite being a surgeon, Robbie is not from the right class and, therefore, spurned as an appropriate suitor by Lilly&#x2019;s snobby parents. Yet the two would-be lovers manage to find one another near the battlefields of France. The question remains whether their love will be realized during those tumultuous years. Robson intermingles the overarching themes of love, war, and societal strictures in this appealing read that should resonate with fans of Downton Abbey. --Julie Trevelyan",

        "0099451743": "What (in Range of Motion) seemed an unerring touch for the emotional truths of women's lives proves imperfect after all for Berg, who misses the mark in this story of a wife and mother who runs away to find herself. In a plot device reminiscent of Ann Tyler's Ladder of Years, Berg's protagonist, Nan, impulsively leaves her Massachusetts home soon after she turns 50, hitting the road to find a new sense of direction. \"I have felt so long like I am drowning,\" she explains in a letter to her husband, Martin, as she begins a car trip westward with no destination in mind except to \"come into my own.\" She chronicles both the geographical terrain and her inner landscape in further letters to Martin and to her grown daughter, Ruthie, and in a journal that has the tone of an adolescent's diary. Women will empathize with Nan's fear of aging and her gradual realization of the resentment she has long felt about filling the role of dutiful wife, but the epistolary device strips the story of immediacy, and the situations Nan describes are often unlikely or merely tame (she has a noisy tantrum at a beauty salon when she decides not to dye her gray hair; she invites a stranger into her cabin in the Minnesota woods and, when they go to bed, they just cuddle). Nan's conversations with other women are overdosed with saccharine, and her epiphanies are old hat. Self-indulgent and cloying, this is a one-tone narrative with almost none of the dramatic resonance Berg's fans have learned to expect.Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

        "0061374229": "Amazon Best of the Month, June 2008: It's gutsy for a debut novelist to offer a modern take onHamletset in rural Wisconsin--particularly one in which the young hero, born mute, communicates with people, dogs, and the occasional ghost through his own mix of sign and body language. But David Wroblewski's extraordinary way with language inThe Story of Edgar Sawtelleimmerses readers in a living, breathing world that is both fantastic and utterly believable. In selecting for temperament and a special intelligence, Edgar's grandfather started a line of unusual dogs--the Sawtelles--and his sons carried on his work. But among human families, undesirable traits aren't so easily predicted, and clashes can erupt with tragic force. Edgar's tale takes you to the extremes of what humans must endure, and when you're finally released, you will come back to yourself feeling wiser, and flush with gratitude. And you will have remembered what magnificent alchemy a finely wrought novel can work. --Mari MalcolmBook DescriptionBorn mute, speaking only in sign, Edgar Sawtelle leads an idyllic life with his parents on their farm in remote northern Wisconsin. For generations, the Sawtelles have raised and trained a fictional breed of dog whose thoughtful companionship is epitomized by Almondine, Edgar's lifelong friend and ally. But with the unexpected return of Claude, Edgar's paternal uncle, turmoil consumes the Sawtelles' once peaceful home. When Edgar's father dies suddenly, Claude insinuates himself into the life of the farm--and into Edgar's mother's affections.Grief-stricken and bewildered, Edgar tries to prove Claude played a role in his father's death, but his plan backfires--spectacularly. Forced to flee into the vast wilderness lying beyond the farm, Edgar comes of age in the wild, fighting for his survival and that of the three yearling dogs who follow him. But his need to face his father's murderer and his devotion to the Sawtelle dogs turn Edgar ever homeward.David Wroblewski is a master storyteller, and his breathtaking scenes--the elemental north woods, the sweep of seasons, an iconic American barn, a fateful vision rendered in the falling rain--create a riveting family saga, a brilliant exploration of the limits of language, and a compulsively readable modern classic.Double Life, with Dogs: An Amazon Exclusive Essay by David WroblewskiWe write the stories we wish we could read. There's no other reason to do it, to spend years pacing around your basement, mumbling, pecking at a keyboard, turning your back on a world that offers such a feast of delicious fruits.The Story of Edgar Sawtellecame about because some time ago I wished I could read a novel about a boy and his dog, one that integrated our contemporary knowledge of canine behavior, cognition, and origins with my experience of living with dogs; if possible, something flavored with the uncynical Midwestern sense of heart and purpose so familiar from my childhood (and something which, in truth, I've spent much my adult life being slightly ashamed of, as if either heart or purpose were embarrassing attributes for a grown-up to display). I'd recently come to know a good dog, maybe the best dog I'd ever met, and the subject of people and dogs and ethics and character suddenly seemed urgent. But when I went looking for such a story, I had to go back almost a hundred years, back to Jack London'sCall of the Wild. That was a surprise. A little while after that, an idea for a story came to me--not the whole thing, but enough to start.Continue ReadingDouble Life, With DogsPraise from Stephen King\"I flat-out lovedThe Story of Edgar Sawtelle, and spent twelve happy evenings immersed in the world David Wroblewski has created. As I neared the end, I kept finding excuses to put the book aside for a little, not because I didn't like it, but because I liked it too much; I didn't want it to end. Dog-lovers in particular will find themselves riveted by this story, because the canine world has never been explored with such imagination and emotional resonance. Yet in the end, this isn't a novel about dogs or heartland America--although it is a deeply American work of literature. It's a novel about the human heart, and the mysteries that live there, understood but impossible to articulate. Yet in the person of Edgar Sawtelle, a mute boy who takes three of his dogs on a brave and dangerous odyssey, Wroblewskidoesarticulate them, and splendidly. I closed the book with that regret readers feel only after experiencing the best stories:It's over,you think,and I won't read another one this good for a long, long time.In truth, there's never been a book quite likeThe Story of Edgar Sawtelle. I thought ofHamletwhen I was reading it, andWatership Down, andThe Night of the Hunter, andThe Life of Pi--but halfway through, I put all comparisons aside and let it just be itself.I'm pretty sure this book is going to be a bestseller, but unlike some, it deserves to be. It's also going to be the subject of a great many reading groups, and when the members take upEdgar, I think they will be apt to stick to the book and forget the neighborhood gossip.Wonderful, mysterious, long and satisfying: readers who pick up this novel are going to enter a richer world. I envy them the trip. I don't re-read many books, because life is too short. I will be re-reading this one.\"",

At heart it means to be entirely practical, as the \"Science\" of the name would indicate. Denying any interest in theology (there is no theology in the Bible, Fox argues), the author instead suggests that what Jesus was after was results: \"Jesus explains to us what the nature of God is, and what our own nature is; tells us the meaning of life and of death; shows us why we make mistakes; why we yield to temptation; why we become sick, and impoverished, and old; and, most important of all, he tells us how all these evils may be overcome, and how we may bring health, happiness, and true prosperity into our lives.\"And the Spiritual Key? Fox puts it quite simply: \"The Truth turns out to be nothing less than the amazing but undeniable fact that the whole outer world--whether it be the physical body, the common things of life, the winds and the rain, the clouds, the earth itself--is amenable to man's thought, and that he has dominion over it when he knows it.\"--Doug Thorpe",
        "0062072188": "Amazon Exclusive: Daniel Silva on WritingPortrait of a Spywith a PencilWhile on book tour, I&rsquo;ve been surprised to find that readers are fascinated by how writers actually write. Most readers hold in their mind an idealized image of the novelist at work&mdash;a figure in a trendy urban coffeehouse, a solitary figure walking along an empty beach. The truth, however, is seldom so romantic.Before going any further, let us stipulate that, much like the hero of my novels, the art restorer and spy Gabriel Allon, I am something of a creature of habit. I work seven days a week, from early in the morning until six thirty in the evening, when I stop to watch the evening news. My work clothing never varies: gray sweatpants by Russell Athletic, a long-sleeve T-shirt by L.L. Bean, fleece Acorn moccasins, and discount cotton socks from Marks &amp; Spencer in England. Occasionally, visitors to our house will catch a glimpse of this outfit, but, for the most part, my wife and children tend to shield me from public view. As a rule, I don&rsquo;t answer the telephone&mdash;unless it is a family emergency of some sort&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t read e-mail. I nibble rather than eat.Portrait of a Spy, like all the Gabriel Allon novels, was fueled largely by McVitie&rsquo;s digestive biscuits.I have a computer, of course, but I really do most of my actualwritingin longhand, on yellow legal pads. I prefer to work while lying on the floor rather than at my desk. This annoys my wife because she took a great deal of time and effort to have a desk custom made to fit my office. When I showed her a photograph of Muriel Spark, one of her literary heroes, writing in longhand stretched across a floor, she was only partially mollified. Sometimes we talk about living somewhere other than Georgetown. Secretly, the very idea terrifies me. After writing 14 books in the same room of the same house, I am afraid I have lost the ability to work anywhere else.As for my writing instrument of choice, it is unquestionably the pencil. There is something about the sound it makes scratching across the page that, for me, is the essence of composition. The pencil is the antithesis of all things cyber and e, a means of returning, however briefly, to a world that is unconnected and unwired. A pad and pencil do not freeze or crash. There are no viruses or error messages. If a thunderstorm knocks out the power, the words will still be there when the lights come on again. And then, there is the satisfying natural rhythm of the work itself&mdash;the turning of the completed page, the sharpening of the dulled point, the fortnightly disposal of the fluffy wooden shavings.Lately, I have been hoarding pencils. I&rsquo;m not sure precisely when it began; I suspect it had something to do with the death of the typewriter. An irrational fear gripped me, a fear that pencils were next. If the typewriter could go extinct, how could the lowly, environmentally hostile pencil possibly hope to survive in the brave new world? I now order my favorite brand&mdash;the Paper Mate Mirado Black Warrior No. 2&mdash;by the case. I am reasonably confident I now have enough pencils on hand to see me through the next several novels&mdash;though, if I happen to misplace a pencil, I will search the house thoroughly before removing a new one from its special drawer and sharpening it for the first time. To sharpen a virgin pencil is, in a sense, to commit an act of assisted suicide. It saddens me.I wish it were not so. I wish I could write on a computer while traveling on an airplane or sitting in a strange hotel room, but I cannot. I have become a prisoner of my office. I need my floor, and my Mirado Black Warrior No. 2 pencils, and my McVitie&rsquo;s digestive biscuits. I hoard them, too. I keep them on a special shelf in the storage room, next to my socks from Marks &amp; Spencer.Copyright &copy; Daniel Silva 2011. All Rights Reserved.",

Jakabok Botch, the child of two demons who has inherited his father's two tails, is rendered even more grotesque after he tumbles into a fire and most of his face is badly burned. A violent dispute with his abusive father, Pappy Gatmuss, leads to the pair being trapped by a net from our world. Jakabok manages to elude capture and eventually finds his way to the home of Johannes Gutenberg, whose wife turns out to be an angel in disguise. The book's format&mdash;simultaneously Botch's first-person narrative and his break-the-fourth-wall address to the reader pleading for him or her to burn the book&mdash;may puzzle readers unused to Barker's quirks.(Oct. 30)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Gilbert and Eleanor Kraus were typical members of an affluent, educated Jewish community in Philadelphia in the 1930s; Gilbert was a lawyer, and Eleanor a bit of a shopaholic. Worried about what they were hearing from Europe by 1939, the Krauses set out to travel to Austria and Germany to save Jewish children from the advancing Nazis; they were not particularly religious or political and this was not an easy task in an era plagued by anti-Semitism and isolationism.  But through careful readings of the law, loopholes in the visa-granting system, and plain old bravery, the Krauses managed to bring more than four dozen children to safety in the United States.  Pressman, the Krauses&#x2019; grandson-in-law, used Eleanor Kraus&#x2019;s unpublished diaries as well as photographs, documents, and interviews  to recreate a historical moment and a heroic act.

And just as Insatiable is switching to a vampire theme to attract a younger demographic, a spate of chilling murders-by-exsanguination grips New York City. Enter Lucien Antonescu, a sexy, melancholic Romanian history professor/vampire who recognizes that the murders are the work of rogue vampires who have broken away from his order.

In Maguire's Oz, Elphaba, better known as the Wicked Witch of the West, is not wicked; nor is she a formally schooled witch. Instead, she's an insecure, unfortunately green Munchkinlander who's willing to take radical steps to unseat the tyrannical Wizard of Oz. Using an appropriately brusque voice for the always blunt Elphaba, McDonough relates her tumultuous childhood (spent with an alcoholic mother and a minister father) and eye-opening school years (when she befriends her roommate, Glinda). McDonough's pacing remains frustratingly slow even after the plot picks up, and Elphaba's protracted ruminations on the nature of evil will have some listeners longing for an abridgement. Still, McDonough's excellent portrayals of Elphaba's outspoken, gravel-voiced nanny, Glinda's snobbish friends and the wide-eyed, soft-spoken Dorothy make this excursion to Oz worthwhile.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Does their own history suggest that such attempts are worth making? Or does it reveal their essential futility?\" Johnson's history is lucid, thorough, and--as one would expect of almost any project with such a broad scope--a little wrong-headed. By the end of the book, readers will be grateful for Johnson's questioning of the Jews' confidence in their cosmic significance.

With the cool logic of accreting snowflakes, his prose builds a world--a small U.S. town near Canada--and peoples it with four vivid, sensitive souls linked by a school-bus tragedy: the bus driver; the widowed Vietnam vet who was driving behind the bus, waving at his kids, when it went off the road; the perpetually peeved negligence lawyer who tries to shape the victims' heartaches into a winning case; and the beauty-queen cheerleader crippled by the crash, whose testimony will determine everyone's fate.We experience the story from inside the heads of the four characters in turn--each knowing things the others don't, each misunderstanding the facts in his or her own way. The method resembles Faulkner'sThe Sound and the FuryandGilbert Sorrentino's stunningAberration of Starlight, but Banks's achievement is most comparable toJohn Updike's tales of ordinary small-towners preternaturally gifted with slangy eloquence, psychological insights, and alertness to life's tiniest details.Egoyan's film is haunting but vague--it leaves viewers in the dark regarding several critical plot points. Banks's book is more haunting still, and precise, making every revelation count, with a finale far superior to that of the film. It's also wittier than the too-sober flick: the lawyer dismisses the dome-dwelling hippie parents of one of the crash victims as being \"lost in their Zen Little Indians fantasy,\" which casts a sharp light on them and him, too. He's lost in his calculations of how each parent will fit into the legal system, and the ways in which he fits into the tragedy are lost on him. If only he and the Vietnam-vet dad could read each other's account of their tense first encounter, both of them might get what the other is missing.Banks's wit is pitiless--it's painful when we discover that the bus driver, who prides herself on interpreting for her stroke-impaired husband, is translating his wise but garbled observations all wrong. The crash turns out not to be the ultimate tragedy: in the cold northern light of its aftermath, we discover that we're all in this alone.",

There are three particular strengths. First, Lewis and Churchill insist that Islam cannot be reduced to extremes as either a bloodthirsty creed or solely a message of peace. The Qur'an advocates a range of responses according to specific circumstances. Second, the authors humanize Islam by including insets on \"Islamic humor\" in every chapter. Third, the book replaces dangerous characterizations of Islam as an enemy with an understanding of Islam as a faith intimately connected to Christianity and Judaism. Through understanding Islam, readers may see that the minority who espouse a radicalized totalitarian version of Islam represent neither the faith nor most of its followers.

Ian Porter is the baritone, thoughtful and deliberative; Adam Sims is lighter spirited, flightier, and more amused by the bizarre comedy of Murakami's puzzle box. Both readers are well chosen, expertly picking their way across the minefield of this intoxicating, perplexing story. And their balancing act mimics the book's alternation of tones, styles, and stories. The recording is studded by occasional studio sound effects that are hardly necessary, but do manage to cleverly amplify the woozy, trippy disorientation of the tale.

They found each other, adrift but determined, on the streets of New York City in the late '60s and made a pact to keep each other afloat until they found their voices--or the world was ready to hear them. Lovers first and then friends as Mapplethorpe discovered he was gay, they divided their dimes between art supplies and Coney Island hot dogs. Mapplethorpe was quicker to find his metier, with a Polaroid and then a Hasselblad, but Smith was the first to fame, transformed, to her friend's delight, from a poet into a rock star. (Mapplethorpe soon became famous too--and notorious--before his death from AIDS in 1989.)

It met with no small outrage when it appeared, as it uses a plot device many readers thought \"unfair.\" There is a full complement of characters populating the cozy English village of King's Abbot: Major Blunt, Colonel Carter, Miss Gannett, the butler, the housekeeper, the narrator, Dr. Sheppard, and his know-it-all sister (the precursor of Miss Marple, according to Christie), and, of course, the redoubtable Hercule Poirot and his little grey cells.

This is not The Lightning Thief (Hyperion, 2005) and the mythology is the lost city of Atlantis rather than the Greek pantheon, but comparisons with the \"Percy Jackson\" series are inevitable. Unfortunately, this volume hardly measures up. Jack McKinley is just not as likable or believable as Rick Riordan's protagonist, and the supporting characters are flat.

An afternoon at the movie theater, for  instance, would be a mixed bag if your favorite movie were showing, but if you  had to eat gravel instead of popcorn. A trip to the zoo would be a very mixed  bag if the weather were beautiful, but all of the man-and woman-eating lions  were running around loose.\" And so it is for the bad-luck Baudelaires.

After Henry Dashwood dies, the Dashwood sisters and their mother are given a house by kindly rich relatives John and Mary Middleton, while the estate that was the Dashwood home passes to the sisters' henpecked half-brother John and his status-conscious wife Fanny. Elinor, the responsible eldest Dashwood sister, is smitten with Fanny's brother Edward Ferrars, though she hasn't heard from him since the move, and he, unbeknownst to her, has been dating the daffy Lucy Steele. Delicate, dramatic, and gorgeous, middle sister Marianne falls for eye-candy John \"Wills\" Willoughby, though he treads on her heart by publicly rejecting her. All this is conveyed in formal prose with equally stiff dialogue, which makes Trollope's offhand mentions of laptops and Range Rovers somewhat jarring. And yet, Trollope's faithfulness to the tropes of this story keep her from letting the plot jibe with the modern world, though she does wink at that: \"You're like those nineteenth-century novels where marriage is the only career option for a middle-class girl.\" The book's resolution for Marianne seems especially unlikely in this era, and could have benefitted from a more malleable adaptation.

Of course, that smile becomes much easier to maintain with each additional kiss Sarah finds herself suddenly sharing with this impossible man. The third sparkling book in her Smythe-Smith quartet is quintessential Quinn: witty, whimsical, and wonderfully romantic. --John Charles",
        "0061950726": "A long journey from home and the struggle to find it again form the heart of the intertwined stories that make up this moving novel. Foster teen Molly is performing community-service work for elderly widow Vivian, and as they go through Vivian&#x2019;s cluttered attic, they discover that their lives have much in common. When Vivian was a girl, she was taken to a new life on an orphan train. These trains carried children to adoptive families for 75 years, from the mid-nineteenth century to the start of the Great Depression. Novelist Kline (Bird in Hand, 2009) brings Vivian&#x2019;s hardscrabble existence in &#xAD;Depression-era Minnesota to stunning life. Molly&#x2019;s present-day story in Maine seems to pale in comparison, but as we listen to the two characters talk, we find grace and power in both of these seemingly disparate lives. Although the girls are vulnerable, left to the whims of strangers, they show courage and resourcefulness. Kline illuminates a largely hidden chapter of American history, while portraying the coming-of-age of two resilient young women. --Bridget Thoreson",

        "0060555661": "Among the library of investment books promising no-fail strategies for riches, Benjamin Graham's classic,The Intelligent Investor, offers no guarantees or gimmicks but overflows with the wisdom at the core of all good portfolio management.The hallmark of Graham's philosophy is not profit maximization but loss minimization. In this respect,The Intelligent Investoris a book for true investors, not speculators or day traders. He provides, \"in a form suitable for the laymen, guidance in adoption and execution of an investment policy\" (1). This policy is inherently for the longer term and requires a commitment of effort. Where the speculator follows market trends, the investor uses discipline, research, and his analytical ability to make unpopular but sound investments in bargains relative to current asset value. Graham coaches the investor to develop a rational plan for buying stocks and bonds, and he argues that this plan must be a bulwark against emotional behavior that will always be tempting during abrupt bull and bear markets.Since it was first published in 1949, Graham's investment guide has sold over a million copies and has been praised by such luminaries as Warren E. Buffet as \"the best book on investing ever written.\" These accolades are well deserved. In its new form--with commentary on each chapter and extensive footnotes prepared by seniorMoneyeditor, Jason Zweig--the classic is now updated in light of changes in investment vehicles and market activities since 1972. What remains is a better book. Graham's sage advice, analytical guides, and cautionary tales are still valid for the contemporary investor, and Zweig's commentaries demonstrate the relevance of Graham's principles in light of 1990s and early twenty-first century market trends.--Patrick O'Kelley",

Here, Santa and his reindeer land on the snowy roof of a Victorian mansion in New England.

Joanna Brady finds her husband, Andy, shot in the Arizona desert on the night of their tenth wedding anniversary. But this, and Andy's subsequent suspicious death in the hospital, is only the beginning of the destruction of the comfortable world of Joanna and her nine-year-old daughter, Jenny. The police decide that Andy, a sheriff's deputy, tried to commit suicide. He is further implicated as the hit man in a mob rub-out and fingered as a crooked cop with drug-cartel connections. Even his personal life is dragged through the mud, as allegations of an extramarital affair surface. Neither mother nor daughter is spared from the brutality of the accusations: the DEA comes after Joanna, while schoolmates taunt Jenny. All the while, Jance cross-cuts to the contract killer who shot Andy. The conclusion features a classic confrontation, but the post-showdown ending seems trite.

Humanity has filled the galaxy, and thanks to ultra-high technology everyone has everything they want, no one gets sick, and no one dies. It's a playground society of sports, stellar cruises, parties, and festivals. Jernau Gurgeh, a famed master game player, is looking for something more and finds it when he's invited to a game tournament at a small alien empire. Abruptly Banks veers into different territory. The Empire of Azad is exotic, sensual, and vibrant. It has space battle cruisers, a glowing court--all the stuff of good old science fiction--which appears old-fashioned in contrast to Gurgeh's home. At first it's a relief, but further exploration reveals the empire to be depraved and terrifically unjust. Its defects are gross exaggerations of our own, yet they indict us all the same. Clearly Banks is interested in the idea of a future where everyone can be mature and happy. Yet it's interesting to note that in order to give us this compelling adventure story, he has to return to a more traditional setting. Thoughtful science fiction readers will appreciate the cultural comparisons, and fans of big ideas and action will also be rewarded.--Brooks Peck",

I like my own pillow, my own imperfect showerhead, my coffee and pizza and bagel shops, my little rituals.  I am quite old lady-ish about it.  I like to write in&mdash;and only in&mdash;my radically unbeautiful office (I share it with guinea pigs).  I like to drive my kids to swimming.  At night, the moment when I shut my book, turn off my bedside table light, and know that everyone is sleeping under the same roof,our roof, is as close to a state of grace as I ever hope to come.  I have always been this person.So it is probably not surprising that, until now, my writing has stuck close to home, as well.  In the first two novels, my characters did a little meandering but rarely outside of the 95 corridor, never outside of the country.  They needed no passports; they never suffered jet lag.  And now, withFalling Together, what have I done but put Will, Augusta, Jason, and my poor aviophobic Pen on airplane after airplane and sent them clear across the world?   What was I thinking?  I was thinking about the story, mostly, and that these were people who, each in her or his own way needed to go in quest of something (apart from Augusta, who has everything she needs).  Also, I was thinking that the Philippines, where my father grew up, is too beautiful, too much a part of the landscape of my heart not to write about.I visited the Philippines for the first time when I was 22 and on Christmas Day, woke up to voluminous sunshine, enfolding heat, a houseful of relatives, and a roasted suckling pig, pointy-eared, tiger&rsquo;s eye-orange, and smelling like bliss. I was not in Kansas (or Virginia) anymore.  I rode in dazzlingly painted jeepneys; I visited roadside fruit stands as resplendent as parade-floats and cemeteries in which people laughed, ate, and talked as though they were in their own living rooms and the gravestones were furniture or friends.  I atea lot:  the little fists of bread called Elordes after the boxer; rice sticky with coconut milk; fish with blue bones like a secret; fruit shaped like sea anemones, hedgehogs, brains; heavenly, palm-sized mangoes with flesh you can scoop like custard.Amid all of these discoveries, the best part was the people, a branch (or palm frond) of my family tree that I had only seen in glimpses.  Now, this family surrounded me.  I learned that traits I thought were uniquely my father&rsquo;s&mdash;having conversations with his eyebrows, a brusque, instinctive generosity that shrugged off thanks&mdash;were family or cultural traits.  I learned thathomeis a word that can stretch.  Since that first visit, I&rsquo;ve been back many times since, especially since my parents retired there six years ago, and every time,homestretches to include something new:  a coral reef, a helper&rsquo;s bewitching baby, a soup made of mung beans, a tiny tarsier&rsquo;s enormous eyes.InFalling Together, Pen goes to the Philippines in search of her friend, but I think she finds more than that.  She sits in a banca boat with a school of jackfish shoaling beneath it and thinks, awestruck, &ldquo;All this time, every second:this.&rdquo;  She experiences the world as big and small at the same time.  While I sit at my desk, drive my children around, sleep under my roof, all the time, every second, there is another version of home, my home, vibrantly alive and unfolding itself thousands of miles away.

Where Alice Humphreys came off as strong and directed in the earlier novel, New Yorker McKenna Wright seems insecure, much less comfortable in her skin. Plotting, too, is a little less focused than usual for Burke, whose Detective Ellie Hatcher series has earned accolades for character development and tightly controlled plotting. Even so, Burke manages to deliver some exciting moments here, as lawyer-turned-journalist McKenna finds her life turned upside down when she recognizes a friend from her college years who disappeared without a trace a decade before on a video of a near-tragedy on the subway. At the same time, McKenna&#x2019;s career takes a devastating hit when evidence turns up that compromising e-mails she used in an article about a judge originated not from the public but from her own computer. Stubborn curiosity about her friend and anger about unjust accusations propel McKenna forward into what others assert is ridiculously wild speculation.

        "0062077562": "A literary work as suspenseful as the best thrillers, Funder&#x2019;s extraordinary first novel is an unflinching portrait of courage in devastating circumstances. The tale unfolds through the dual reminiscences of Ruth Becker, an elderly resident of Sydney in 2001, and Ernst Toller, eminent playwright and former leader of the short-lived Bavarian Republic. Both belonged to a group of left-wing German activists who were forced into exile in London after Hitler came to power, and who risked everything to alert the world&#x2014;especially Britain, whose deliberate blindness grows increasingly infuriating in the novel&#x2014;to the danger the Nazis posed. Settled into New York&#x2019;s Mayflower Hotel in 1939, Toller reworks his autobiography to make the woman who was its emotional heart live once again. Dora Fabian was Ruth&#x2019;s cousin and Toller&#x2019;s lover, and the passionate intensity that defines her political and personal existence blazes through these pages. The moral dilemmas affecting Funder&#x2019;s characters, all based on historical figures, are as strongly evoked as the repressive environment they inhabit and are brave enough to stand against. --Sarah Johnson",

This book, whose title means \"the present\" or \"unable to go unnoticed\" in Arabic, has an initial staggered laydown of eight million copies in 83 countries and 42 languages. It centers on the narrator's search for his missing wife, Esther, a journalist who fled Iraq in the runup to the present war, only to disappear from Paris; the narrator, a writer, is freed from suspicion when his lover, Marie, comes forward with a (true) alibi. He seeks out Mikhail, the man who may be Esther's most recent lover and with whom she was last seen, who has abandoned his native Kazakhstan for a kind of speaking tour on love. Mikhail introduces the narrator to a global underground \"tribe\" of spiritual seekers who resist, somewhat vaguely, conventional ways of living. Through the narrator's journey from Paris to Kazakhstan, Coelho explores various meanings of love and life, but the impact of these lessons is diminished significantly as they are repeated in various forms by various characters.

Instead, she is greeted with suspicion and even hostility. Young men have been disappearing at an alarming rate, and a ridiculous-sounding rumor has begun that these vanishings are the work of Valkyries: beautiful women from mythology who were seen around battlefields gathering the souls of young men for Odin's army of the undead in Valhalla.

Naturally, the 16-year-old is dismayed to learn that all but the last part is true.

Meanwhile, virtually friendless Colin Friedland combines his obsessions with sex and death with a growing interest in neurolinguistic programming (NLP), forging an all-consuming avocation. Annabel also is a crack police analyst who spots an alarming increase in the number of bodies found in their homes in various states of decomposition in the town of Briarstone, causing police to start looking for connections between the recently dead (but not murdered) and the local newspaper to launch a Love Your Neighbour campaign, urging residents to check on those living nearby.

Written in 1935 about Carol Ryrie Brink's grandmother's childhood, the adventures of Caddie and her brothers are still exciting over 60 years later.

This Newbery Medal-winning book bursts at the seams with Caddie's irrepressible spirit. In spite of her mother's misgivings, Caddie is a perfect role model for any girl--or boy, for that matter.

        "B00004U5VF": "The Tekken series has always stood as a set of console games that went above and beyond their arcade counterparts.  From additional characters to completely new modes, the series has always tried to add something that the arcade games lacked.  Tekken Tag Tournament, at first glance, is the most dramatic upgrade over an arcade Tekken game to date. The graphics have been given a huge boost, similar to the upgrade that Namco's weapon-based fighter, Soul Calibur, received when it hit the Dreamcast last year. Plus, new modes have been added. But does the series capture the same magical feeling that made the previous Tekken games such smash hits? Most definitely.Tekken Tag Tournament serves as an upgrade to Tekken 3, adding a few new moves along the way. Fighters that had appeared in Tekken 2 but were missing from Tekken 3 have been brought back as well, and most of them have lots of new moves to help balance them with the more powerful Tekken 3 fighters. Finally, the game is now fought in the same tag-team style as Capcom's versus series of fighters, so you can switch between two different characters at any time. Much like Street Fighter EX3 and Dead or Alive 2, you can have up to four players, with each player controlling a different fighter in the tag battle. However, unlike most other tag-battle fighters, Tekken Tag rounds end after only one of the two fighters have been defeated, rather than letting the battle continue as a one-on-two affair. An option that let you configure this would have been nice. Aside from the standard tag-battle arcade mode, there is also a one-on-one game that makes Tekken Tag Tournament more like the previous Tekken games, as well as the standard team battle (though it is now a tag-team battle), time attack, and survival modes. Unlockable modes include a theater mode, where you can watch all of the game's endings; a gallery mode, which lets you pause the game at any time and snap a screenshot of the action that is saved to your memory card for later viewing; and Tekken bowl mode, a bowling minigame that lets you hit the lanes and toss glimmer globes at Heihachi-headed bowling pins. Each character has a different bowling style that affects speed and control. The character endings, with the exception of the game's final boss, are rendered using the game engine. This presumably saved time during the game's development. As a result, they're short, mostly meaningless, and decidedly less than impressive.  By comparison, the prerendered intro and the final boss' prerendered ending are simply incredible pieces of footage. In Japan, the TV commercial for the game is simply an abridged version of the game's new intro movie. Very striking stuff.Graphically, the game has taken a very large leap, and the arcade version of the game looks downright ugly by comparison.  The characters are very, very smooth, and the backgrounds are amazing and filled with lots of movement, from helicopters to crowds of spectators. Some stages are well lit, showing off some really excellent lens-flare techniques. There are also some nice little touches, such as grass being crushed down by falling fighters then slowly springing up afterward. However, the game suffers from one particular problem that has in fact been seen throughout the series, but with the power of the PlayStation2 behind it, you'd expect it to be a thing of the past. The problem is the same one that showed up in Street Fighter EX3. While the backdrops of the fights and the ground on which you fight look great separately, they don't mesh very well. The result is two different types of scrolling, making it look as if the battle is occurring on a small, circular spinning platform surrounded by a nearly stationary background. It's easy to miss while you're actually playing, but it sticks out like a sore thumb on watching the game closely. Also, the game uses much of the same animation and motion-capture data from Tekken 3. Sure, the characters look pretty incredible, but with the identical animation quality, even as good as that animation was, the game looks and feels a little on the stale side. The soundtrack is full of techno and vocoder robot voices that will either endear you to the soundtrack or drive you up the wall.How much you enjoy the game will directly relate to one factor: If you played so much Tekken 2 and 3 that you couldn't possibly play another match, Tekken Tag doesn't offer enough new features to draw you back in. But if you've stayed away from the Tekken series for a long time, Tekken Tag is a very warm homecoming, delivering the same solid gameplay that Tekken fans crave in large doses. Still, you won't be able to stop yourself from wondering what Namco could have done with the game if it had been designed on the PS2 (or comparable arcade hardware) from the start. Guess we'll all have to wait for Tekken 4 to find that out.--Jeff Gerstmann--Copyright &#169; 2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

        "B0000DJX7I": "Praised for brilliant scripts and open-ended gameplay, vilified for unapologetic violence and mature themes,Grand Theft Autohas deservedly become one of the most popular game franchises in history. This double pack contains the full versions of bothGrand Theft Auto IIIandGrand Theft Auto III: Vice City, enhanced for Xbox. Xbox gamers can rejoice that the grand king of video games--The Sopranoswith a gamepad--is finally available on the big black box.Grand Theft AutoWithGrand Theft Auto IIIRockstar proves that not all developers are concerned with toning down the violence in their games. This sequel is even more bloody, violent, and sadistic than its popular predecessors, offering up an enormous 3-D city in which nearly any criminal act is possible. Players are free to steal cars, beat up the local population for their money (or weapons), make time with prostitutes, or simply roam to their heart's content. Those seeking more structure can embark on dozens of missions driven by a genuinely interesting crime-story plot or steal cars that let them play minigames. Nab a cop car and you can go on vigilante missions. Grab a cab and you can play a deadly version ofCrazy Taxi. Take a fire truck and you can earn money putting out fires. The minigames are a good way to unwind after a particularly difficult mission. With so much to do, the game just never gets boring.As you'd expect, there are consequences for criminality. As your random acts of mayhem mount up the police start hounding you, eventually calling in SWAT trucks, the FBI, and even the army if you continue down the path of destruction. Shaking these pursuers is easily the most fun part of the game, especially when a bunch of friends are packed in the room to witness your narrow escapes.Grand Theft Auto IIIis fine-tuned to near perfection in every category. All the vehicles, from slick sports cars to lumbering dump trucks, handle exactly as you'd expect and smash apart realistically when abused. The three islands in the game are rendered in terrific detail considering their size, and are packed with traffic, pedestrians, and hidden jumps. The audio is equally amazing. Pedestrians talk, cops scream at you, and you can tune in nine different radio stations whenever you are in a car. It all adds up to a monumental achievement: the rare console game for adults that manages to get everything right.--T. Byrl BakerGrand Theft Auto III: Vice CityHow big is this game? Even publicists for other games end up talking aboutVice Citywhen they call our office, babbling in the same helplessly intoxicated way that afflicts everyone who plays it. The achievement ofVice City(which, as everyone knows by now, is set in the 1980s and offers an all-new, Miami Vice-inspired story) is not only that it manages to live up to an absurd level of expectation, but that it takes the game places that fans of its predecessorGrand Theft Auto IIInever dreamed of, and that it achieves this astonishing level of innovation without losing anything that madeGTA3the bestselling PS2 game of all time.After a brilliant homage to the era of the Commodore 64 in the opening credits, the first thing you'll notice is the improved graphics, which are smoother and more detailed, and--with effects like neon lights reflected on rain-slick streets, and intense Florida sunlight--have a lush, tropical look that immediately gives you a strong sense of place. The architecture is more fabulous by tenfold, with art deco buildings, high-rise hotels, and believably seedy back alleys. The control scheme is essentially the same as inGTA3, but the cars handle much better, and in pedestrian mode there is a new crouch move. You will have access to fast, great-handling cars right away, as opposed toGTA3which made you unlock the second island before you could get your hands on any respectable wheels. This game has such riches to offer that there is no need to be chintzy with the vehicles.Cops are more vigilant this time--minor offenses like whacking innocent bystanders will more often than not get you a two-star wanted level--and are harder to elude (though they still can't seem to climb stairs or negotiate sharp turns). So while free-roaming exploration is as fun as ever, there is more incentive to perform the missions instead of randomly raising hell. Not that that's a bad thing: even lazy criminals like myself (inGTA3, I would rather toss hand grenades into traffic than follow orders from some rude Mafia boss) will be quickly caught up in the vivid characters and hilarious, fascinating story, in which you play an acid-washed-jeans-wearing thug named Tommy Vercetti. Where inGTA3missions were blocky, schematic affairs only nominally connected to the story, this time tasks move the story briskly along and deftly blend cinematics and game action. For example, there is a scene of a character throwing Tommy a gun, at which point you are suddenly thrown back into the action and must make an instant decision about whom to trust and what to do.There are more, and more detailed, indoor environments, including a hotel, police station, and mall (a slight downside to this is that some of the more elaborate indoor environments require load times). The layout of the city, with tons of backyards, narrow alleys, and fire escapes, encourages creativity when eluding pursuit, as does greater access to rooftops. Get your motorcycle up the fire escape and a whole new world of action is possible, including... well, use your imagination.This overview barely scratches the surface of theVice Cityexperience, its colorful explosion of music, clothes, combat, and brilliant voice acting, not to mention the plot twist midway through the game that changes the very nature of the game itself. Though it was the outrageous, amoral violence that got all the press, the essential genius ofGTA3was its intoxicating blend of script and open-ended action. InVice Citythis is--to use a clich&#xE9; that is for once apropos--taken to a whole new level.--David StoeszPros:Open-ended gameplay; player can chose to be relatively law-abiding or engage in wanton virtual destructionVaried missionsBrilliant scripts with Hollywood voice actingRocking sound track (also available in our Music store)Xbox-enhanced graphicsCons:As theThe Sopranosof games,GTA 3draws unwanted attention from overzealous legislatorsNo multiplayer",

        "0020519109": "Here, for a change, is a fish tale that actually does honor to the  author. In factThe Old Man and the Searevived Ernest Hemingway's career, which was foundering under the weight of such postwar stinkers asAcross the River and into the Trees. It also led directly to his receipt of the Nobel Prize in 1954 (an award Hemingway gladly accepted, despite his earlier observation that \"no son of a bitch that ever won the Nobel Prize ever wrote anything worth reading afterwards\"). A half century later, it's still easy to see why. This tale of an aged Cuban fisherman going head-to-head (or hand-to-fin) with a magnificent marlin encapsulates Hemingway's favorite motifs of physical and moral challenge. Yet Santiago is too old and infirm to partake of the gun-toting machismo that disfigured much of the author's later work: \"The brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its reflection on the tropic sea were on his cheeks. The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords.\" Hemingway's style, too, reverts to those superb snapshots of perception that won him his initial fame:Just before it was dark, as they passed a great island of Sargasso weed that heaved and swung in the light sea as though the ocean were making love with something under a yellow blanket, his small line was taken by a dolphin. He saw it first when it jumped in the air, true gold in the last of the sun and bending and flapping wildly in the air.If a younger Hemingway had written this novella, Santiago most likely would have towed the enormous fish back to port and posed for a triumphal photograph--just as the author delighted in doing, circa 1935. Instead his prize gets devoured by a school of sharks. Returning with little more than a skeleton, he takes to his bed and, in the very last line, cements his identification with his creator: \"The old man was dreaming about the lions.\" Perhaps there's some allegory of art and experience floating around in there somewhere--butThe Old Man and the Seawas, in any case, the last great catch of Hemingway's career.--James Marcus--This text refers to an alternatePaperbackedition.",

Eighteen months later only one ship remained and 18 passengers survived. Marco Polo never revealed what happened to these lost ships. Embarking on a quest to find the lost fleet, fortune hunter Nathan Drake soon realizes Marco Polo was hiding a much bigger secret - he had gone on a secret expedition to find the mythical kingdom of Shambhala and to recover the legendary Cintamani Stone, the \"Wish-fulfilling jewel\" of Buddhist mythology. With this new information Drake settles on a new course, following Marco Polo's trail through a diverse range of exotic environments. This quest also pits him against a new, more formidable adversary - a ruthless, rogue paramilitary leader with a private army and a relentless ambition to recover the stone for himself.GameplayAlthough gameplay inAmong Thievesis similar to that of the previous game, there are several major differences.

Powered by an all-new engine,Sonic Unleashedblends classicSonicgameplay with a variety of in-game perspectives to create an entirely new and unique gaming experience. Merging blistering 2D action with meticulously rendered 3D environments, players race through intriguing locations across the globe as Sonic to save a chaotic world.The other side of SonicSonic and his alter ego Werehog.View larger.Collect rings for Ring Energy.View larger.Swing into action with Werehog.View larger.A NewSonica New StoryOn a quest for world domination Sonic nemesis Dr. Eggman has managed to steal the chaos emeralds once again and this time drained them of their power. As a result not only has the Earth split into distinct sections, so has Sonic. Now he is two beings. During the day he is the usual speed-addicted hedgehog players will remember, but at night he becomes Sonic the Werehog. In either form it is the player's ultimate goal to find the missing chaos emeralds and return them to their proper place in order to set the world and Sonic himself, back the way he should be.Gameplay: The Two Sides of SonicLike nearly allSonicgames,Sonic Unleashedis platform-based. The game combines the feel of 2D side-scrolling that fans of theSonicseries love, with sharp 3D graphics, and throws in an over the back third-person perspective reminiscent of FPS gameplay for good measure. And just as in earlier games, as players race through and explore the expansive world before them, using auto lock to hone in on enemies and areas of interest, they will rely on the power they gain from the rings they collect for a variety of things, but with the new twist of Sonic's split personality, things are a little bit different.Playing during the day, as you race across the world in the form of Sonic, speed is the main goal. Collecting rings fills you with 'Ring Energy,' which not only provides extra life, but also the advantage of 'Sonic Boost.' With this players can travel at speeds that approximate 300 MPH. In addition,Sonic Unleashedintroduces two new features: the 'Speed Drift' and the 'Quick Step'. Speed Drifting is similar to drifting in racing games, allowing players to slide around corners at high speeds, while Quick Stepping is a sidestepping maneuver allowing Sonic to avoid enemies with quick steps to either side. Both keep you moving as fast as possible, so you can get as many rings as possible, which again keeps you moving as fast as possible.As night falls and Sonic assumes his Werehog form the rings provide a different kind of power more suited to his more menacing appearance. Much slower, but also much more powerful, the Werehog relies on the rings to provide life as well as strength to shield himself from the attacks of enemies. This is necessary because Werehog gameplay, although based in platforming, incorporates significant levels of combat as well. Red orbs gathered as enemies are defeated allow the player to unlock additional combo moves that will supplement the hack and slash and arm stretching abilities that the Werehog always possesses. Whether Hedgehog or Werehog, no matter which form players prefer they will get ample opportunity to explore the two sides of Sonic since each area in the game contains both night and day segments where each form must be played.Key Game Features:Sonic&rsquo;s World Transformed- Sonic maintains his high-speed abilities during the day, but at night he is transformed into a mysterious dark form with incredible never-before-seen abilities including 3D-action brawling and amazing agility.Tight Navigation and Speed Control- Players accelerate to super speed with &lsquo;Sonic Boost&rsquo; by collecting rings to increase Sonic&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ring Energy.&rsquo; Using &lsquo;Quick Step,&rsquo; players will quickly move left or right to avoid obstacles instantly. Additionally, &lsquo;Speed Drift&rsquo; allows players to rocket through turns without slowing down.Powerful New Engine and Cinematic Graphics- With its new modified game engine,Sonic Unleashedenhances the classic 2D perspective with mind-blowing 3D stages. Other technology capabilities include global illumination, grid computing, continuous data streaming and an intricate path finding system.Enhanced and Expanded Environments- Many unique and fascinating continents offer the player an opportunity to save the world in a dynamic, high-speed experience. In addition to exploring exciting unlockable areas, players dash through up to nine locations resembling real-life destinations including the Great Wall of China, Arctic Pole glaciers and many more.Whether it's the updated graphics that retain the side-scrolling feel of classic games in theSonicfranchise, an expansive world to race through and explore or the multiple and new ways to play,Sonic Unleashedoffers something for players of any age or level of ability.",

        "006017143X": "Many years ago, when the first volume ofTales of the Citywas going to press, Christopher Isherwood compared its author's narrative gifts to those of Charles Dickens. This has proven to be the blurb of a lifetime, an ever-renewable currency appearing on almost all of Armistead Maupin's subsequent books. Yet it has held up well--Dickens's gentle satire and broad good humor live on in Maupin more than in any other English-speaking writer.The Night Listeneris his most ambitious work to date. While not strictly autobiographical, the story does teasingly suggest correspondences to the author's own life in a way that will delight and frustrate his many fans. The main character, Gabriel Noone, is a professional storyteller who broadcasts roughly autobiographical sketches for a long-running PBS series, \"Noone at Night,\" stories about people \"caught in the supreme joke of modern life who were forced to survive by making families of their friends.\"  When the novel opens, Gabriel is still reeling from the announcement that his much younger, longtime partner Jess (a.k.a. Jamie in the \"Noone at Night\" stories, and a.k.a. Terry Anderson, Maupin's real-life, much-younger partner, for those who like to track associations) wants to move into his own apartment and start dating other men.  With the success of his HIV cocktail, Jess has exceeded his own life expectancy. Having prepared himself so well to die, he now needs to learn how to live again. To Gabriel's distress, Jess's new life involves leather, multiple piercings, and books on men's drumming circles.When an editor sends Gabriel yet another book to blurb, he reluctantly opens the package to find a long, rending memoir by Pete Lomax, an HIV-positive 13-year-old survivor of incest, rape, and sexual slavery. The book is calledThe Blacking Factory, after the miserable London bottling factory where Dickens spent part of his poverty-stricken childhood. As Gabriel reflects:Pete thinks we all have a blacking factory, some awful moment, early on, when we surrender our childish hearts as surely as we lose our baby teeth. And the outcome can't be called. Some of us end up like Dickens;  others like Jeffrey Dahmer. It's not a question of good or evil, Pete believes.  Just the random brutality of the universe and our native ability to withstand it.After Pete escaped from his parents and was adopted by a therapist named Donna Lomax, his slow recovery was helped along by his memoir-writing and by frequent doses of \"Noone at Night.\"Touched by Pete's devotion to his stories, as well as the boy's obvious need for a father figure, Gabriel finds himself drawn into an intense relationship with his young fan, involving long, late-night phone calls that begin to worry Gabriel's friends.  And, other than their mutual need, how much does he really know about Pete, anyway?   As Gabriel begins to question his own motives, as well as those of the boy,The Night Listenertransforms itself from an absorbing but quotidian story of loss and midlife angst into a dark and suspenseful page-turner with a playful metaphysical aspect and an un-Dickensian sexual candor.--Regina Marler",

In the book's first chapter, in characteristically understated style, Feiler suggests a viable parallel to his journey:Abraham was not originally the man he became. He was not an Israelite, he was not a Jew. He was not even a believer in God--at least initially. He was a traveler, called by some voice not entirely clear that said: Go, head to this land, walk along this route, and trust what you will find.Feiler, a fifth-generation American Jew from the South, had felt no particular attachment to the Holy Land.

It also has a format with wide appeal, more or less cribbed from the bestselling Why Do Men Have Nipples? Instead of personal health questions, Bertoldi answers queries like \"Do the dead go to ball games?\" (Yes) and \"How meaningful are coincidences in our lives?\" (Very). The book also has a dishy element, delving into the medium's personal life (her husband's a skeptic) and a number of celebrity encounters. Though generally fun reading throughout, questions of God, heaven and other spiritual matters are met with vague language; she's similarly uninformative regarding practical matters like finding happiness or contacting the seemingly omnipresent dead.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0060393491": "Product DescriptionWally Lamb's two previous novels,She's Come UndoneandI Know This Much Is True, struck a chord with readers. They responded to the intensely introspective nature of the books, and to their lively narrative styles and biting humor. One critic called Wally Lamb a \"modern-day Dostoyevsky,\" whose characters struggle not only with their respective pasts, but with a \"mocking, sadistic God\" in whom they don't believe but to whom they turn, nevertheless, in times of trouble (New York Times).In his new novel,The Hour I First Believed, Lamb travels well beyond his earlier work and embodies in his fiction myth, psychology, family history stretching back many generations, and the questions of faith that lie at the heart of everyday life. The result is an extraordinary tour de force, at once a meditation on the human condition and an unflinching yet compassionate evocation of character.When forty-seven-year-old high school teacher Caelum Quirk and his younger wife, Maureen, a school nurse, move to Littleton, Colorado, they both get jobs at Columbine High School. In April 1999, Caelum returns home to Three Rivers, Connecticut, to be with his aunt who has just had a stroke. But Maureen finds herself in the school library at Columbine, cowering in a cabinet and expecting to be killed, as two vengeful students go on a carefully premeditated, murderous rampage. Miraculously she survives, but at a cost: she is unable to recover from the trauma. Caelum and Maureen flee Colorado and return to an illusion of safety at the Quirk family farm in Three Rivers. But the effects of chaos are not so easily put right, and further tragedy ensues.While Maureen fights to regain her sanity, Caelum discovers a cache of old diaries, letters, and newspaper clippings in an upstairs bedroom of his family's house. The colorful and intriguing story they recount spans five generations of Quirk family ancestors, from the Civil War era to Caelum's own troubled childhood. Piece by piece, Caelum reconstructs the lives of the women and men whose legacy he bears. Unimaginable secrets emerge; long-buried fear, anger, guilt, and grief rise to the surface.As Caelum grapples with unexpected and confounding revelations from the past, he also struggles to fashion a future out of the ashes of tragedy. His personal quest for meaning and faith becomes a mythic journey that is at the same time quintessentially contemporary&#8212;and American.The Hour I First Believedis a profound and heart-rending work of fiction. Wally Lamb proves himself a virtuoso storyteller, assembling a variety of voices and an ensemble of characters rich enough to evoke all of humanity.",

        "0061431389": "America's first century was defined by expansion and the negotiation of territories among areas colonized by the French and Spanish, or occupied by natives. The exact location of borders became paramount; playwright and screenwriter Stein amasses the story of each state's border, channeling them into a cohesive whole. Proceeding through the states alphabetically, Stein takes the innovative step of addressing each border-north, south, east, west-separately. Border stories shine a spotlight on many aspects of American history: the 49th parallel was chosen for the northern borders of Minnesota, North Dakota, and Montana because they ensured England's access to the Great Lakes, vital to their fur trade; in 1846, Washington D.C. residents south of the Potomac successfully petitioned to rejoin Virginia (called both \"retrocession\" and \"a crime\") in order to keep out free African-Americans. Aside from tales of violent conquest and political glad-handing, there's early, breathtaking tales of American politicos' favorite sport, gerrymandering (in 1864, Idaho judge Sidney Edgerton single-handedly \"derailed\" Idaho's proposed boundary, to Montana's benefit, with $2,000 in gold).

She and her sister were raised to value book smarts as well as worldly experience. What those outside of the family didn't know was that the reason Sontag was so accomplished and committed to her extracurricular activities was that she would've done anything to get away from her father, Stephen. By enforcing a peculiar system of rules and consequences, he micromanaged every moment of her life, tape-recording her conversations, measuring the length of her fingernails and locking all the phones in a safe when he left the house. When Sontag broke the rules, regardless of circumstance, he would verbally abuse her for hours, dictating letters of apology from her to him (I am a selfish, rotten, worthless brat, etc.). Sontag's mother, Ellen, reneged on plans to divorce him for years, perhaps partly because Stephen prescribed her into complacency with lithium. In adulthood, Sontag found herself caught in self-defeating patterns that smacked of her father's thrall. Struggling to break free, she even resorted to homelessness before finally severing her relationship with Stephen. Sontag's is a brave account, not only of what it's like to take the brunt of an abusive parent's wrath, but of what it means to have the courage to leave.(Apr.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The turntable portion of the controller is made up of a realistic platter that spins all the way around in both directions when pushed by the player and has familiar green, red and blue buttons attached on top. The mixer half has a sliding three-position fader bar, a button used to activate star power like \"Euphoria\" gameplay sections which temporarily double point multipliers, an effects knob and a hidden control panel containing your console's standard navigational buttons. Gameplay takes you through pre matched, two-jam tracks, with the green and blue buttons oriented on the left and right edges of the note highway and on the platter representing these, and the red button in the middle providing  a spot to add samples, which can be changed at various times in the game with the effects knob. Players must perform three main types of DJ actions when prompted by the note highway: taps, which are beat matching actions requiring the pushing of buttons on the platter;  fader bar moves indicating either a selection of one of the two tracks during the jam, or a mix of the two; and scratching, which entails selecting one of the two tracks on the platter and moving the turntable quickly up and down. In addition, players can activate Euphoria strategically, as success throughout sections of a track fills the Euphoria meter at the left, and shoot for the additional bonus of a Rewind, given for perfection in certain sections, and allowing the player to replay that same section again for additional points.It's interesting how this latest release in the series parallels the historical deconstructive trend  in actual pop music, which saw Hip-hop, Electronica, House, and other musical genres rise through the use of DJ sampling and mixing techniques, but does this mean thatDJ Herowill enjoy as much success and be as good a play experience as some of theHerogames that came before it? Only time will tell, but after a few hours breaking it down on the DJ deck myself, it seems to me that the game has a major thing going against it, and an equally important positive thing going for it that together will probably decide this for most players. The negative is that the controller used is a bit more difficult to operate than any used in earlier games, except perhaps the drums ofGuitar Hero World Tour, while the positive is that the overall gameplay is as fun and infectious as any seen in the series.To be clear, the controller issues alluded to are by no means a deal breaker. More than anything else, what the vast majority of players will be challenged by in theDJ Herocontroller is their unfamiliarity with a DJ deck. As popular as DJ influenced music is in reality, not too many fans per capita have had hands-on experience with the tools of the trade, unlike the legions ofGuitar Herofans, purchasing in their millions, who are at least somewhat familiar with how a guitar, drum and microphone work. Another inconvenience related to the controller is its fairly cramped layout, with both sections residing right next to each other and no apparent way to create space between the two pieces without disconnecting them. This is enhanced by the fact that in many cases the controller may be more easily worked from a high platform in front of the standing player, potentially making this lack of space even more of a problem. But as with any new controller type, muscle memory will kick in with practice and players become more comfortable with the basic DJ mechanics of the game. There are also some simple hints doled out by the in-game tutorials that should be heeded, like when scratching make sure to let go at the end of each scratch, and anchor your hand to the turntable deck with your thumb to avoid spinning the platter too wildly. Also, the two pieces of the controller can be swapped to allow for left-handed play, and thankfullyDJ Hero's development team recognized that discouraged players are not a good thing and did away with the familiarGuitar Heroscenario of AI audiences booing a player off the stage. If you are screwing up they will still let you know, but at least players will always get the experience of finishing. At the end of each set you are rated at 1-5 stars, where the more stars you get the more tracks are unlocked and DJ gear is made available to you. The gradual organization of the game's four play settings also help you build confidence by introducing more advanced skills as you progress. In Easy, players primarily use tapping and a simplified form of scratching. The Medium setting adds fader bar functionality. Play on the Hard level requires precise directional scratching, where you must scratch in the same direction as the note highway. The assumption is that Expert level bumps things up even farther, although this level was not available with the demo played.Finally, as part of the fun built into the game, players can expect various ways to play and experience the game. These include a variety of gameplay modes including single player, a head-to-head multiplayer DJ vs. DJ mode where two players work their way through the same track for the best possible point total, the multiplayer Guitar and DJ mode which is compatible with allGuitar Heroguitars made for the same platform, and Party Mode where scoring is turned off and you can just listen to the 80+ unique mixes by big name DJs included in the game. And as with all games in theGuitar Heroseries players can expect some pretty deep character customization options to be made available as their skills rise.Taken together does all this equate to a quality music gameplay experience? Well, what I've seen is pretty solid, so if you are a fan of bothGuitar Herotype gameplay and DJ music and culture, I'd say you almost certainly will not be disappointed. Also, with its new controller, as well as different and in many places, challenging gameplay, if you are more interested inDJ Heroas a departure from series' very well-worn gameplay mold, you will probably be equally happy.Tom Milnes, Amazon.com/games freelance contributor",

        "009956064X": "The rediscovery and rejuvenation of Richard Yates's 1961 novelRevolutionary Roadis due in large part to its continuing emotional and moral resonance for an early 21st-century readership. April and Frank Wheeler are a young, ostensibly thriving couple living with their two children in a prosperous Connecticut suburb in the mid-1950s. However, like the characters in John Updike's similarly themedCouples, the self-assured exterior masks a creeping frustration at their inability to feel fulfilled in their relationships or careers. Frank is mired in a well-paying but boring office job and April is a housewife still mourning the demise of her hoped-for acting career. Determined to identify themselves as superior to the mediocre sprawl of suburbanites who surround them, they decide to move to France where they will be better able to develop their true artistic sensibilities, free of the consumerist demands of capitalist America. As their relationship deteriorates into an endless cycle of squabbling, jealousy and recriminations, their trip and their dreams of self-fulfillment are thrown into jeopardy.Yates's incisive, moving, and often very funny prose weaves a tale that is at once a fascinating period piece and a prescient anticipation of the way we live now. Many of the cultural motifs seem quaintly dated--the early-evening cocktails, Frank's illicit lunch breaks with his secretary, the way Frank isn't averse to knocking April around when she speaks out of turn--and yet the quiet desperation at thwarted dreams reverberates as much now as it did years ago. Like F. Scott Fitzgerald'sThe Great Gatsby, this novel conveys, with brilliant erudition, the exacting cost of chasing the American dream.--Jane Morris, Amazon.co.uk--This text refers to an alternatePaperbackedition.",

A rescue flight was quickly dispatched--it crashed in a November storm, stranding its own nine crewmembers. The third time was not the charm: a second rescue mission disappeared in another blizzard, leaving neither clues nor apparent survivors. Subsequent attempts--some with fatal results--failed under the harsh conditions, forcing the men to weather the Arctic winter in makeshift shelters, including the tail section of a broken bomber. This tale of survival in the deadliest conditions would be enthralling on its own (and it is), but Zuckoff's meticulous research led him to a modern-day group dedicated to solving the mystery of the third flight. As a chronicler of their mission, Zuckoff is swept into their adventure, and his project becomes much more than an interesting World War II subplot.

        "0060558288": "Secular liberals and religious conservatives will find things to both comfort and alarm them in Jim Wallis'sGod's Politics. That combination is actually reason enough to recommend the book in a time when the national political and theological discourse is dominated by blanket descriptions and shortsightedness. But Wallis, editor ofSojournersmagazine, offers more than just a book that's hard to categorize. What Wallis sees as the true mission of Christianity--righting social ills, working for peace--is in tune with the values of liberals who so often run screaming from the idea of religion. Meanwhile, in his estimation, religious vocabulary is co-opted by conservatives who use it to polarize. Wallis proposes a new sort of politics, the name of which serves as the title of the book, wherein these disparities are reconciled and progressive causes are paired with spiritual guidance for the betterment of society. Wallis is at his most compelling when he puts this theory into action himself, letting his own beliefs guide him through stinging criticisms of the war in Iraq. In his view, George W. Bush's flaw lies in the assumption that the United States was an unprecedented force of goodness in a fight against enemies characterized as \"evil.\" Indeed, although both the right and left are criticized here, the idea is that the liberals, if they would get religion, are the more redeemable lot. Wallis's line between religion and public policy may be drawn a little differently than most liberals might feel comfortable with, and while he pays some lip service to other faiths most of his prescription for America seems to come from the Bible. Still, for a party having just lost a presidential election where \"moral issues\" are said to have factored heavily,God's Politicsis a sermon worth listening to.--John Moe",

CIA \"Stake-Out\" agent Emma Watson takes her job personally, having lost her parents to vampires six years earlier. Ambushing vamps in New York City's Central Park, Emma neither suspects nor particularly cares that there are, in fact, two vampire factions: one evil, bent on destroying humanity, and the other good, having eschewed people blood for a synthetic substitute. One of the good guys, Scottish vamp Angus McKay, has been assigned to stop her nightly patrols, but instead finds himself falling in love. Soon Emma's deep-rooted beliefs are coming unmoored: undeniably attracted to Angus, she can't bear the thought of loving&mdash;or even trusting&mdash;a vampire, but she's left without a choice when Angus's ex-lover decides to capture them both as a gift to her evil overlord. Sparks's plot, though it lacks the satirical snap of her previous vamp novels, serves the romance between Angus and Emma well. Though it should please her fans, Sparks's latest probably won't win her any new readers in a market saturated with vampire-human love stories.(Apr.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Blake has an excellent, manly voice, perfect intonation and excellent streetwise cursing abilities (a crucial part of Gardner's account of his relationship with his stepfather). Yet as good as the narrator is, by the third CD listeners may not be able to shake the feeling that he's an actor reading someone else's words. Since Gardner's love of jazz is a running theme, the evocative jazz trumpet music at the beginning and end of each CD is appropriate; even more between-tracks music might have been effective where the narrator's pauses are not long or dramatic enough (say, between one sentence where he is with his biological father in Louisiana and the next, at work in his brokerage office).

A steroid devotee since the age of 20, Canseco goes beyond admitting his own usage to claim that with the tacit approval of the league's powers-that-be he acted as baseball's ambassador of steroids and is therefore indirectly responsible for \"saving\" the game.Chief among his claims is that he introduced Mark McGwire to steroids in 1988 and that he often injected McGwire while they were teammates. According to Canseco, steroids and human growth hormones gave McGwire and Sammy Sosa (whose own usage was \"so obvious, it was a joke\") the strength, stamina, regenerative ability, and confidence they needed for a record-setting home run duel often credited with restoring baseball's popularity after the 1994 strike. Although he devotes a lot of ink to McGwire, Canseco envisions himself as a kind of Johnny Steroidseed, spreading the gospel of performance enhancement, naming a number of players that he either personally introduced to steroids or is relatively certain he can identify as fellow users. Because Canseco plays fast and loose with some of the facts of his own career he provides fodder for those looking to damage his credibility, but in many ways questions of public and personal perception are what raise the book beyond mere vitriolic tell-all. Those willing to heed his request and truly listen to what he has to say will findJuicedto be an occasionally insightful meditation on the workings of public perception and a consistently interesting character study.--Shane Farmer",

        "0060652969": "The Problem of Painanswers the universal question, \"Why would an  all-loving, all-knowing God allow people to experience pain and suffering?\"  Master Christian apologist C.S. Lewis asserts that pain is a problem because our  finite, human minds selfishly believe that pain-free lives would prove that God  loves us. In truth, by asking for this, we want God to love us less, not more  than he does. \"Love, in its own nature, demands the perfecting of the beloved;  that the mere 'kindness' which tolerates anything except suffering in its object  is, in that respect at the opposite pole from Love.\" In addressing \"Divine  Omnipotence,\" \"Human Wickedness,\" \"Human Pain,\" and \"Heaven,\" Lewis succeeds in  lifting the reader from his frame of reference by artfully capitulating these  topics into a conversational tone, which makes his assertions easy to swallow  and even easier to digest. Lewis is straightforward in aim as well as honest  about his impediments, saying, \"I am not arguing that pain is not painful. Pain  hurts. I am only trying to show that the old Christian doctrine that being made  perfect through suffering is not incredible. To prove it palatable is beyond my  design.\" The mind is expanded, God is magnified, and the reader is reminded that  he is not the center of the universe as Lewis carefully rolls through the  dissertation that suffering is God's will in preparing the believer for heaven  and for the full weight of glory that awaits him there. While many of us naively  wish that God had designed a \"less glorious and less arduous destiny\" for his  children, the fortune lies in Lewis's inclination to set us straight with his  charming wit and pious mind.--Jill Heatherly",

Echoes of Yossarian, the wise-ass bombardier who was too smart to die but not smart enough to find a way out of his predicament, could be heard throughout the counterculture. As a result, it's impossible not to considerCatch-22to be something of a period piece. But 40 years on, the  novel's undiminished strength is its looking-glass logic. Again and again, Heller's characters demonstrate that what is commonly held to be good, is bad; what is sensible, is nonsense.Yossarian says, &quot;You're talking about winning the war, and I am talking about winning the war and keeping alive.&quot;&quot;Exactly,&quot; Clevinger snapped smugly. &quot;And which do you think is more important?&quot;&quot;To whom?&quot; Yossarian shot back. &quot;It doesn't make a damn bit of difference who wins the war to someone who's dead.&quot;&quot;I can't think of another attitude that could be depended upon to give greater comfort to the enemy.&quot;&quot;The enemy,&quot; retorted Yossarian with weighted precision, &quot;is anybody who's going to get you killed, no matter which side he's on.&quot;Mirabile dictu, the book holds up post-Reagan, post-Gulf War.

The rumors have been abound for the past year, as everyone wondered when the next installment would be ready. Bungie and Microsoft did a stellar job keeping their lips sealed, and fans benefited from their first glimpse of the hallowed third and final installment.The short presentation was delivered in real-time on the Xbox 360 using the current version of theHalo 3game engine.

Needless to say, the gaming community is salivating.CJ Cowan, Bungie's director of cinematics discussed one of the most startling moments of the presentation: the return of Cortana. \"Given the variety of character and story arcs at the end ofHalo 2, we wanted to boil down our announcement to a few key threads. Cortana and the Chief being a galaxy apart is a situation we haven't seen before, and is something that is a powerful component toHalo 3. We are using her transmissions in the demo to give the viewer a few subtle clues to her situation and state of mind, without revealing any specifics we want to save for the game itself.\"Graphically, the game closely follows in the tradition ofHalo 2, although it has been upgraded to take advantage of the Xbox 360's more prodigious visual abilities. As art direct Marcus Lehto explained, \"[The presentation] was intended to be an understated announcement ofHalo 3-- the tone is that of mystery and suspense -- the calm before the storm. I wanted to make sure that we reintroduced the Chief, showed that Earth was thoroughly conquered, with Covenant everywhere, and that there is a glorious, ancient artifact buried under the Earth's crust which will provideHalo 3with the epic journey which we all want.\"Taking full advantage of the power of Xbox 360,Halo 3expands on everything that has made the franchise great, adding a wealth of technical and gameplay advancements.

Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, doubters say it would be suicide.

As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races; a more realistic damage system; a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage; a regenerative health system; a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard; and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard.

When their only child left for college, and the nest emptied completely, Darling knew she had to reinvent or rediscover herself lest she succumb to the cumulative grief of both events.  She abandoned the verve and bustle of New York for the pervasive solitude of Vermont, buying a remote backwoods cabin that could only generously be called rustic.  Darling discovers that what she doesn&#x2019;t know about rural life is nearly eclipsed by what she doesn&#x2019;t know about herself, yet her determination to learn not only how to live but how to survive is a project she embraces with a journalist&#x2019;s passion for truth and fact-finding.  Along with unrelenting loneliness and unyielding Yankee stoicism, Darling also confronts her own mortality when she is diagnosed with breast cancer.  Darling has written a fierce and forthright chronicle of one formidable woman&#x2019;s courageous journey of healing and revelation, gratitude and resilience. --Carol Haggas",

Players also can exchange student-record books with other players over WiiConnect24 and compete against their save data. With 15 new activities that challenge the brain in single-player Test and Practice modes,Big Brain Academy: Wii Degreesees how players measure up in five categories: Identify, Memorize, Analyze, Compute and Visualize. All activities are designed around the Wii Remote's pointer. Players can play solo with one Wii Remote, or pass it around like a relay baton in group competitions.Sample activities:The activities inBig Brain Academy: Wii Degreeare fun minigames with a ton of variety, and they're meant to be played rapid-fire for a short time as players push their brains to do more than they did the day before. Here are three of the activities included in the game:Art Parts:In this Visualize activity, players must complete the sample painting by stamping the missing pieces onto an unfinished scene. When it becomes more difficult, Art Parts flips the unfinished scene sideways or flips it upside-down.Balloon Burst:In this Compute activity, players must pop balloons in rising numerical order. At its easiest, there are few balloons shown at once. On a higher difficulty level, Balloon Burst sends in more balloons, including some with negative numbers.Fast Focus:In this Identify activity, players see a distorted image that slowly returns to normal. Players must select what it is as soon as they figure it out. As it grows more difficult, Fast Focus starts with a more heavily distorted image, so it takes longer to identify what it is.How to progress through the game:When players start a new game, they'll meet the whimsical Dr. Lobe, who will suggest that they take on the Test mode challenge: playing all 15 activities that span the five brainy categories. He'll tell players how big their brain is based on how well they did and how fast they did it. He'll encourage players to take the Test often and to use Practice mode to beef up their skills in all 15 of the activities. Practice mode also offers three difficulty levels for each activity, and Dr. Lobe will award several medals for high achievement in each one.Multiplayer:Big Brain Academy: Wii Degreeoffers three ways for groups to play:Mental Marathon: Speed through activities to buy more time to stay in the game. Go it solo or as a team, but if anyone botches an activity, the game is done (1-8 players, one Wii Remote).Mind Sprint: Form a team to compete against a system-controlled competitor that \"thinks\" like a selected student record (1-4 players with one Wii Remote). Or separate into two teams (2-8 players with two Wii Remotes). The first side to complete a set number of problems wins.Brain Quiz: Play game-show style with up to four teams that compete in a total of 20 activities, since five extra activities are available in this mode. (1-8 players, one Wii Remote)Mii compatibility:Everyone who enrolls in the academy will choose a Mii, which will walk down the school's hallway and pop up during Wii Remote handoffs to help explain which teammate goes next in multiplayer matches.Wii Remote audio:Players will get encouragement and hear color commentary from a \"Wii Remote Coach\" who speaks to the player through the Wii Remote speakers.WiiConnect24:InBig Brain Academy: Wii Degree, players can send and receive student-record books full of brainy data. By establishing WiiConnect24 ties with Wii Friends who own the game, players can all see their academies affected in several fun ways:Compare distant students' test scores with those of the local student body on the Student Scores board. Distant students' records are shown as books.Compete against distant students' brains in Mind Sprint. Players actually play against game-controlled competitors that \"think\" based on brainy strengths and weaknesses in their student records.The distant player's \"Mii student\" will walk the hallways with the player's own student body.

His fascinating memoir reflects on the sizable group of lepers living alongside the prisoners, social outcasts among the motley inmate crew of drug dealers, mob types and killers. Narrating in colorful, entertaining snapshots, White introduces the reader to an excellent supporting cast in his imprisonment: Father Reynolds, the peerless spiritual monk; Mr. Flowers, the no-nonsense case manager; Anne, the sorrowful mother with leprosy whose baby was taken from her arms; and Ella the Earth Mother, with wisdom to spare. Brisk, ironic and perceptive, White's introspective memoir puts a magnifying glass to a flawed life, revealing that all of life is to be savored and respected.(June)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Their father, Gene, was a drug addict attracted to young girls. Their mother, Izzy, was a boozer who paid little attention to the care and safety of her daughters. Gene died of dubious causes, and Izzy killed herself in grief. The girls are better off without their parents, and they know it. The challenge is to stay out of the way of the authorities for a year until Marnie turns 16 and will be legally able to take guardianship of her sister. Their nosy neighbor, Lennie, a homosexual whose partner has recently died, leaving him bereft and at loose ends, provides their only stability.

Lorenzo (Ren) Gage is a devilishly handsome movie star, best known for his villainous roles onscreen and his playboy antics off. Isabel Favor is a tightly wound self-help guru and author of The Four Cornerstones of a Favorable Life whose own perfect life has recently come crashing down around her. Both have come to Italy to escape the endless rehashes of their latest misfortunes in the public eye, and the equally endless drone of self-criticism. Ren and Isabel meet under what can only be described as unusual circumstances, leaving each of them thinking, thankfully, they'll never see the other again. Imagine their surprise when Isabel turns up on Ren's doorstep, her much anticipated rental villa belonging to none other than her ill-advised one-night stand. As might be anticipated, their fiery antagonism soon breeds sparks of a different kind. The relationship develops in a somewhat familiar fashion, but the development of Isabel and Ren as characters makes their story shine. Meanwhile, at the villa, all is not as it seems, and the two lovers find themselves playing amateur detectives, trying to untangle the strange behavior of the townspeople and of Ren's hired caretaker. As if things weren't complicated enough, Ren's ex-wife, Tracy, suddenly appears on the scene pregnant and with several kids in tow. Tracy's appearance ushers in a touching subplot centering on the nature of marriage in the real world an unexpected and affecting treat in the midst of this steamy, lighthearted romance. With this intriguing combination of the fantasy and reality of romance, Phillips has created a very modern and textured tale: witty, moving, passionate and tender.Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",
        "0099460297": "The artful construction of this seductive novel and the mature, compassionate wisdom permeating it would be impressive for a seasoned writer, but it's all the more remarkable in a debut. This narrative of the McLeod family during three vital summers is rich with implications about the bonds and stresses of kin and friendship, the ache of loneliness and the cautious tendrils of renewal blossoming in unexpected ways. Glass depicts the mysterious twists of fate and cosmic (but unobtrusive) coincidences that bring people together, and the self-doubts and lack of communication that can keep them apart, in three fluidly connected sections in which characters interact over a decade. These people are entirely at home in their beautifully detailed settings Greece, rural Scotland, Greenwich Village and the Hamptons and are fully dimensional in their moments of both frailty and grace. Paul McLeod, the reticent Scots widower introduced in the first section, is the father of Fenno, the central character of the middle section, who is a reserved, self-protective gay bookstore owner in Manhattan; both have dealings with the third section's searching young artist, Fern Olitsky, whose guilt in the wake of her husband's death leaves her longing for and fearful of beginning anew. Other characters are memorably individualistic: an acerbic music critic dying of AIDS, Fenno's emotionally elusive mother, his sibling twins and their wives, and his insouciant lover among them. In this dazzling portrait of family life, Glass establishes her literary credentials with ingenuity and panache.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

        "B00006I02Z": "In many ways, creating a sequel toHalf-Lifeis an unenviable task.  After all, the goal is to craft not just any ordinary game, but an improvement to a title that is widely considered to be the high water mark for first person shooters.  Fortunately, Valve does not disappoint on their sophomore effort.Half-Life 2picks up exactly where its predecessor leaves off, with gamers stepping once more into Gordon Freeman's HVAC suit as he awakes at some indeterminate time in the future, now apparently in the employ of the mysterious G-Man.  Humanity has been sold out to alien forces, and your job is to escape their thrall and lead the resistance to victory.HL2's key successes are in a few critical areas, the first of which is the new physics & graphics engine, called Source.  People and objects fall, fly, tip over, float, and break in an extraordinarily realistic fashion, and in-game puzzles often require you to use simple applications of physics to progress. Second, an elaborate facial structure system coupled with excellent voice acting make for some of the most believably human NPCs in gaming history.  This is no small thing; you will find yourself actually caring about the characters who surround you, even those that are normally regarded as cannon fodder.  Third, the level design exhibits a subtle brilliance, which frequently fools you into feeling like you're making your way through an organic environment and not a forced linear path.  These elements combine to form one of the most truly immersive experiences ever captured on a PC.This gaming bliss comes at a cost, however.  If your computer isn't running the latest and greatest hardware, you may find yourself turning down a lot of the slick graphics to keep the machine from choking.  Also, at the time of this writing the only two bundled multiplayer games are a barely updated version ofCounter-StrikeandHL2 DeathMatch.Counter-Strike: Sourceis every bit as fun as the original, but the DeathMatch is lackluster and contains only a handful of uninspired maps.Overall,Half-Life 2is a smashing success, every bit worthy of the prestige and respect that the franchise has been awarded.  This is absolutely a game that every computer gaming enthusiast is going to want to have in their collection.-- Jon \"Safety Monkey\" GroverPros:Advanced graphics and physics system provide highly immersive experienceBelievable, expressive non-player charactersFun, realistic level designCons:Requires a very fast computer to play with all bells & whistles onDeathMatch mode has few maps and is not terribly entertaining",
        "0061375381": "Starred Review. Set in Victorian London, this superb debut from British author Barnes raises the bar for historical thrillers, starting with its curious opening line: Be warned. This book has no literary merit whatsoever. A page-turner, it's full of peculiar characters, notably Edward Moon, a highly unorthodox detective, and Moon's bizarre sidekick, known only as the Somnambulist. Moon, a conjuror by profession whose act has fallen on hard times, has cracked some of the city's most notorious murders. Now, he's leading the investigation into a shadowy religious group aiming to overtake London and do away with its oppressive, bourgeois tendencies. Moon is a remarkable invention, a master of logic and harborer of all sorts of unnatural habits and mannerisms. The Somnambulist&mdash;a giant, milk-swigging mute&mdash;doesn't appear to be human at all, yet serves as Moon's moral as well as intellectual compass. Together, they wend their way through a London rich in period detail. Barnes saves his best surprise for the story's homestretch, when he reveals the identity of his narrator, who's been cleverly pulling strings since the opening.(Feb.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Soon after Moist von Lipwig (aka Alfred Spangler), Pratchett's not-quite-hapless, accidental hero, barely avoids hanging, Lord Havelock Vetinari, the despotic but pretty cool ruler of Ankh-Morpork, makes him a job offer he can't refuse&mdash;postmaster general of the Ankh-Morpork Post Office. The post office hasn't been open for 20 years since the advent of the Internet-like clacks communication system. Moist's first impulse is to try to escape, but Mr. Pump, his golem parole officer, quickly catches him. Moist must then deal with the musty mounds of undelivered mail that fill every room of the decaying Post Office building maintained by ancient and smelly Junior Postman Groat and his callow assistant, Apprentice Postman Stanley. The place is also haunted by dead postmen and guarded by Mr. Tiddles, a crafty cat. Readers will cheer Moist on as he eventually finds himself in a race with the dysfunctional clacks system to see whose message can be delivered first. Thanks to the timely subject matter and Pratchett's effervescent wit, this 29th Discworld novel (after 2003'sMonstrous Regiment) may capture more of the American audience he deserves.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0060899220": "Most diners believe that their sublime sliver of seared foie gras, topped with an ethereal buckwheat blini and a drizzle of piquant huckleberry sauce, was created by a culinary artist of the highest order, a sensitive, highly refined executive chef. The truth is more brutal. More likely, writes Anthony Bourdain inKitchen Confidential, that elegant three-star concoction is the collaborative effort of a team of \"wacked-out moral degenerates, dope fiends, refugees, a thuggish assortment of drunks, sneak thieves, sluts, and psychopaths,\" in all likelihood pierced or tattooed and incapable of uttering a sentence without an expletive or a foreign phrase. Such is the muscular view of the culinary trenches from one who's been groveling in them, with obvious sadomasochistic pleasure, for more than 20 years. CIA-trained Bourdain, currently the executive chef of the celebrated Les Halles, wrote two culinary mysteries before his first (and infamous)New Yorkeressay launched this frank confessional about the lusty and larcenous real lives of cooks and restaurateurs. He is obscenely eloquent, unapologetically opinionated, and a damn fine storyteller--a Jack Kerouac of the kitchen. Those without the stomach for this kind of joyride should note his opening caveat: \"There will be horror stories.

        "B0000TSRA6": "The virus has spread online, and Resident Evil's gameplay has never been so infectious. Fighting for life with three human-controlled characters at your side definitely adds an element of unfamiliarity to the survival horror mix, but make no mistake, this is still Resident Evil. Whether you find yourself jumping out of your seat as a zombie crashes through a window, marveling at the action in the cutscenes, or complaining about the stiffness of control and awkwardly placed camera angles, this is just another trip to Raccoon City. Only this time, you're with friends.I really have to hand it to Capcom for making teamwork the cornerstone of gameplay. In every room that you reach, this game hammers home the message that you have to stick together and work as a group. When jumping from one rooftop to another, you may misjudge the distance and fall short. Thankfully, a teammate can pull you up.Even before the game commences, you'll find yourself coordinating tactics with your soon-to-be companions at the character selection screen. In a similar vein to an RPG, each of the eight playable characters that you can select brings completely different abilities to the table that you must factor in. Do you bring a lock-picker? Someone with extra inventory spots? Or rely on firepower with a weapons expert?Unlike the other games in the series, zombies can pass from room to room and are often found in packs. Taking this newfound hunting prowess into account, Capcom has implemented a handful of new techniques that players can use to survive. You can slide under beds, hide in lockers, and even repel a zombie attack by forcing their head away from your neck with enough breathing room to raise your pistol and shoot them directly between the eyes. You'll even find strategy in the reloading of weapons. For instance, a box of shells takes more time to load than a clip. As annoying as it is to watch your character get munched because he couldn't load the rounds quick enough, I really like this aspect. It makes you keep an eye on every little detail.Where Outbreak excels in engrossing multiplayer and creative gameplay, the overall design of the game is very odd. Rather than creating one lengthy quest that players can really sink their teeth into, Capcom opted to break up the game into five separate scenarios that are roughly 45 minutes each. If you die, you'll turn into a zombie for a brief extent (and yes, you can attack your teammates if you like), then will be dropped out of the game. Sadly, you can't re-spawn. You either have to wait for your friends to finish up, or find another game to enter. While scripted controller commands are offered, it doesn't support voice chat at all or keyboard functionality in-game. Someone's head should roll for this!All told, this is a surprisingly enjoyable online venture that showcases some amazing gameplay concepts, yet a lack of foresight in the delivery of multiplayer.Concept:A highly creative, yet slightly flawed approach to multiplayer survival horrorGraphics:Not as lavish as the recent GameCube releases, yet impressive nonethelessSound:Great ambiance, but it sure would be nice to communicate with other players. Where's the voice chat?!Playability:Familiar RE controls with innovative teammate techniques and newfound environment interactionEntertainment:Entertaining, yet lacking all the elements that would keep you hookedReplay:Moderately LowRated:7.5 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:May 20042nd Opinion:Why isn't there voice chat in Resident Evil: Outbreak? For the love of all that is holy, I want to give this game a good score for its thoughtful level design, nice graphics, intense gameplay, and smart mission structure&nbsp;&#8211; but that missing headset support throws the whole experience out of whack. These levels are fast-paced and frantic, almost like an FPS, and what you want is to make some sort of strategy. This just isn't possible with the canned commands available, as \"You two check out the locker room and we're going to search the owner's office. Meet back here and we'll go up to the 3rd floor,\" weirdly isn't mapped to the right analog stick. So, this game gets the backhanded compliment of being \"high concept\" like Crystal Chronicles and Steel Battalion, for example. My ideal setup is playing this game with four friends, four TVs, and four PS2s all in the same room. Get this setup, and the game is a real gem.Rated:8 out of 10Editor:Lisa MasonSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review",
        "0061257079": "Trigiani's sequel toVery Valentineis a sweet second act for shoemaker and designer Valentine Roncalli. Val takes over the New York family-run shoe business with feet-of-clay older brother, Alfred; falls for the dashing, older Gianluca in Italy; and takes a business risk in South America, where she unearths a dusty chapter of family history. There are plenty of picturesque globe-trotting adventures in Tuscany, Manhattan, and Buenos Aires, and,  for artistic and independent Val, a grown-up commitment evolves. There is no art without love. Only love can open someone up to the possibilities of living and creating art, Val writes to the wary Gianluca. And the startling twist of family history finally challenges an old-fashioned, insular clan to join the modern world. But it's always the endearing, unnerving and rowdy Roncallis who steal the show. Look for a heartbreaking exit of one beloved character, and a cliffhanger breakup in this charming valentine to love, forgiveness, and family.(Feb.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0062003992": "Schoenewaldt's heartbreaking debut is the late 19th century immigrant coming-of-age story of poor, plain Irma Vitale. When Irma's&nbsp;mother dies, she warns her 16-year-old daughter that leaving their little Italian village dooms her to die among strangers. A few years later, Irma, frightened of her increasingly lustful father, leaves her village and, armed only with her sewing skills and a small dowry, secures passage on the Servia, where she meets the first in a series of helpful strangers who will color, shape, and add the occasional zest of danger (her face is scarred by the time she disembarks) to her journeys. In America, her friendships with a few determined women--Lula, an African-American cook; Molly, an Irish maid; and Sofia, an Italian nurse--help keep her afloat and moving from a Cleveland sweatshop, through misery and rejuvenation in Chicago, and, finally, to the lush hills in San Francisco. Though some plot turns are played too melodramatically, Irma's adventures and redeeming evolution make this a serious book club contender. (Feb.)(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.  All rights reserved.",

He sought a place of rumored existence called the White City, with which he became obsessed upon learning that, in 1940, colorful adventurer Theodore Morde announced its discovery, though he kept proprietarily circumspect about its exact location. Morde then became an OSS agent but never returned to Honduras. With the assistance of Morde&#x2019;s journal, an experienced American archaeologist, and local Honduran guides, Stewart sallied forth for the tropical forest where lurked the White City. Rutted roads, torrential rivers, and steep mountains interposed, battering the author&#x2019;s confidence in carrying on, but the narrative must, and he did, reaching in a state of exhaustion a site that might or might not have been the White City. Wryly self-critical, Stewart entertains vicarious explorers about a journey that was better in the abstract than in actuality. --Gilbert Taylor",

        "0099478447": "Set in London during and just after World War II, Graham Greene'sThe End of the Affairis a pathos-laden examination of a three-way collision between love of self, love of another, and love of God. The affair in question involves Maurice Bendrix, a solipsistic novelist, and a dutifully married woman, Sarah Miles. The lovers meet at a party thrown by Sarah's dreary civil-servant husband, and proceed to liberate each other from boredom and routine unhappiness. Reflecting on the ebullient beginnings of their romance,  Bendrix recalls: \"There was never any question in those days of who  wanted whom--we were together in desire.\" Indeed, the affair goes on  unchecked for several years until, during an afternoon tryst, Bendrix  goes downstairs to look for intruders in his basement and a bomb falls on  the building. Sarah rushes down to find him lying under a fallen door,  and immediately makes a deal with God, whom she has never particularly  cared for. \"I love him and I'll do anything if you'll make him  alive.... I'll give him up forever, only let him be alive with a  chance.... People can love each other without seeing each other, can't  they, they love You all their lives without seeing You.\"Bendrix, as evidenced by his ability to tell the story, is not dead,  merely unconscious, and so Sarah must keep her promise. She breaks off  the relationship without giving a reason, leaving Bendrix mystified and angry.  The only explanation he can think of is that she's left him for another  man. It isn't until years later, when he hires a private detective to  ascertain the truth, that he learns of her impassioned vow. Sarah  herself comes to  understand her move through a strange rationalization. Writing to God in her  journal, she says:You willed our separation, but he [Bendrix] willed it  too. He worked for it with his anger and his jealousy, and he worked for  it with his love. For he gave me so much love, and I gave him so much  love that soon there wasn't anything left, when we'd finished, but You.It's as though the pull toward faith were inevitable, if  incomprehensible--perhaps as punishment for her sin of adultery. In her  final years, Sarah's faith only deepens, even as she remains haunted by  the bombing and the power of her own attraction to God. Set  against the backdrop of a war-ravaged city,The End of the Affairis equally haunting as it lays forth the question of what constitutes love  in troubling, unequivocal terms.--Melanie Rehak--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

        "0061239240": "Starred Review. Dedicated to the late Tony Hillerman, Jance's brilliant fourth suspense novel featuring former homicide detective Brandon Walker and his wife, novelist Diana Ladd (after Day of the Dead), spans some 50 years, from a murder in 1959 in San Diego to a rash of killings in Thousand Oaks, Calif., and Tucson, Ariz., in 2009. Interwoven with these crimes are legends of the Tohono O'odham Indians (aka the Desert People) and the lives of such contemporary Native people as Lani Walker, Brandon and Diana's adopted daughter. Jance's masterful handling of a complex cast of characters makes it easy for the reader to appreciate the intricate web of relationships that bind them across generations. The title refers to the night-blooming Cereus, a desert plant that blooms once a year and is of great symbolic importance to the Tohono. Jance, perhaps best known for her J.P. Beaumont series (Fire and Ice, etc.), has crafted a mystery that Hillerman would be proud of and that her fans will love. 7-city author tour.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0061779741": "Amazon Exclusive: Christopher Moore on WritingSacre BleuI suppose it started when I learned the circumstances of the suicide of Vincent van Gogh; how he had finished a painting, then walked into a corn field and shot himself, and not in the manner one thinks of a suicide. He shot himself in the abdomen, then walked over a mile on a rough trail through the woods above the village of Auvers, France, to the home of his friend, Doctor Gachet, for help. It seemed clear to me that this was not the behavior of a suicidal man. (Particularly when you see how well he was painting at the time.)  Vincent had been murdered, and for some reason, I guess from looking at his paintings, I thought that the color blue might be a clue to the circumstances of his murder.So I decided to write a novel about the color blue.When it first occurred to me, I had no idea what a can of paint of I was opening. I&rsquo;ve written historical novels before, but I&rsquo;d always picked periods and stories that had huge blank spots in them, spots that I could fill in with my story. But I was about to write about the period in which the French Impressionists rose to prominence, and unlike the life of Jesus or the court of King Lear, where very little was known about what actually happened,  I could pretty much look up what each of the Impressionists had for breakfast every morning.  It was a curse of riches. There was more material than I could ever cover in a single story, unless I found a way to constrain it.So, to pursue my murder mystery, my tale of an art movement,  my portrayal of the Bell Epoch in Paris, I had to find a point of view that would help me cover the time period, from 1863 to 1891 and beyond, so I invented, Lucien Lessard, the baker of Montmartre, Paris&mdash;the baker who wants to be a painter, whose father was a patron of Monet, Renoir, and Cezanne when they were at their poorest, and who attended art school with Vincent van Gogh and his best friend, Henri Toulouse-Lautrec. Lucien and Henri would be my detectives, and with them, we would discover not only Vincent&rsquo;s killer, but the secret and magic behind the mysterious shade of &ldquo;sacred blue&rdquo; (Sacr&eacute; Bleu), and how it had inspired and haunted artists all through history.Four years after the notion first occurred to me, I turned in the manuscript toSacr&eacute; Bleu, and I think it is what I had hoped it could be: a mystery, a fantasy, a romance, a comedy, a history, and an appreciation. I didn&rsquo;t have an art education going into this book, but I certainly do coming out, and I hope that the reader will painlessly and joyfully, share some of the enthusiasm I have for the subject.Or, as it says in the prelude:&ldquo;Blue is glory and power, a wave, a particle, a vibration, a resonance, a spirit, a passion, a memory, a vanity, a metaphor, a dream.Blue is a simile.Blue, she is like a woman.&rdquo;",

As we strove to make the fascinatingAge of Empires IIItime period come alive, that goal quickly evolved: We at Ensemble Studios wanted to create the best-looking game ever. From the stunning water effects to the hundreds of units battling on-screen, you'll feel like you're a part of the action in the New World.Tone mapping--This photo imaging technique balances the colors in a scene on the fly. The end result is a rich, warm game where bright colors are vibrantly rendered alongside darker counterparts, such as shadows.Lighting and shadows--The sun is always shining inAge of Empires, so it's important that lighting and shadows be an awe-inspiring experience. Units and buildings cast shadows according to a real sun position, and even cast shadows on each other. High Dynamic Range rendering allows us to represent the shiny glints of sunlight that bounce off highly reflective surfaces.Bump and specular mapping--Water glistens like water. Metal shines like metal. These advanced techniques serve to provide an extra level of rendering detail heretofore unseen in real-time strategy (RTS) gaming.Water--We felt that portraying stunning, realistic water effects in the game was so important that we devoted a programmer to it full-time. You'll find the water rich with details like foam near the shore, accurately modeled water motion, flotsam in rivers and realistic water colors. Plus, reflections change with the viewing angle, the angle of sunlight and the motion of the water. The overall effect is breathtaking.Cliffs and Riverbeds--Instead of just stretching terrain, we built a system to attach geometry to the terrain map to allow for realistic overhangs and steep cliffs, from areas like the American Southwest. This effect is supported on random maps too.CivilizationsBritishQuick access to Settlers gives the British one of the strongest economies in the game. The ability to upgrade two key units -- the Musketeer and Hussar -- make the British military formidable in the late game. The British Home City emphasizes improvements to technology and naval warfare.DutchAlthough Dutch Settlers are limited and costly, their civilization makes up for this economic disadvantage by building Banks and generating coin automatically. The Dutch Home City emphasizes upgrades to defense and economy.FrenchAlthough the French economy starts slowly, the Coureur unit, a Villager with strong fighting skills, makes the French difficult to attack early. The French also have the strongest cavalry unit in the game -- the Cuirassier. Plus, the French are experts at allying with the Native Americans.GermanThe Germans have fewer Settlers and therefore a slower economy. Fortunately, both the Settler Wagon and Uhlan cavalry spawn for free from the German Town Center. Plus, the Germans start with the ability to send Mercenaries from their Home City (long before other civilizations can).Native AmericanEuropean civilizations can learn new technologies and gain troops by forging alliances with the Native Americans. A British player who allies with the Iroquois is essentially playing as two civilizations: the British and the Iroquois.OttomanFor the Ottomans, Settlers spawn automatically from the Town Center. Building a Mosque and conducting research help keep that Settler production steady. Befitting their position straddling Europe and Asia, the Ottomans have more unique units than any other civilization.PortugueseStarting the game with two Town Centers, the Portuguese can quickly produce Settlers, control territory or support their allies. The Spyglass ability allows the Portuguese to easily spy on the enemy. The Portuguese also have a strong navy, strong light infantry and the best Dragoons in the game.RussianStarting the game with extra resources but fewer Settlers gives the Russians the flexibility of focusing on economy or an early raid. Russian infantry, individually weak, are trained in blocks at a faster rate, providing the Russians with the opportunity to overwhelm their enemy with greater numbers.SpanishThe Spanish have a strong military, with both hand infantry and cavalry. Flexibility in early shipments from the Home City give the Spanish the option to attack early or set up for a strong, late economy. Spanish Home City improvements benefit soldiers, buildings and naval units.&nbsp;CombatAge of Empires IIIgives players an amazing amount of control over their side of the battlefield.More to command -- Not only are you in command of large and diverse armies of infantry, cavalry and artillery, but also Native American warriors, mercenaries and tall ships.Multiple formations -- You can assign different formations to your army for different strengths and weaknesses, or have the game automatically choose the most appropriate formation. Examples include:Volley -- ranged infantry, like musketeers, take turns firing at enemies ahead of them.Charge -- your soldiers walk, then run into combat. Cavalry wield sabers, and musketeers fix bayonets. This formation does tremendous damage but makes your soldiers more prone to injury.Bombard -- your soldiers protect the cannons, while the cannons shell enemy ranks. Available only when you have artillery in your army.Battles are easier to follow -- You can still command individual units. But when the units fight in formation, you'll be able to tell exactly who is winning the fight.Real-time physics -- Infantry struck by cannon fire will be thrown like rag dolls, perhaps even over a cliff and into the water. Cannonballs bounce and ricochet.Detailed destructions -- Shingles, shutters and whole towers may fly off a building and interact with the terrain, such as crashing into nearby water. This next generation effect is done on the fly so that each building always has a unique destruction, no matter how many times you see it.Unique animations -- With hundreds of unique combat animations, you'll never see the same battle twice.",
        "0060571993": "Geologically speaking, 1906 was a violent year: powerful, destructive earthquakes shook the ground from Taiwan to South America, while in Italy, Mount Vesuvius erupted. And in San Francisco, a large earthquake occurred just after five in the morning on April 18--and that was just the beginning. The quake caused a conflagration that raged for the next three days, destroying much of the American West's greatest city. The fire, along with water damage and other indirect acts, proved more destructive than the earthquake itself, but insurance companies tried hard to dispute this fact since few people carried earthquake insurance. It was also the world's first major natural disaster to have been extensively photographed and covered by the media, and as a result, it left \"an indelible imprint on the mind of the entire nation.\"Though the epicenter of this marvelously constructed book is San Francisco, Winchester covers much more than just the disaster. He discusses how this particular quake led to greater scientific study of quakes in an attempt to understand the movements of the earth. Trained at Oxford University as a geologist, Winchester is well qualified to discuss the subject, and he clearly explains plate tectonics theory (first introduced in 1968) and the creation of the San Andreas Fault, along with the geologic exploration of the American West in the late 19th century and the evolution of technology used to measure and predict earthquakes. He also covers the social and political shifts caused by the disaster, such as the way that Pentecostalists viewed the quake as \"a message of divine approval\" and used it to recruit new members into the church, and the rise in the local Chinese population. With many records destroyed in the fire, there was no way to distinguish between legal and illegal immigrants, and thus many more Chinese were granted citizenship than would have otherwise been. Filled with eyewitness accounts, vivid descriptions, crisp prose, and many delightful meanderings,A Crack in the Edge of the Worldis a thoroughly absorbing tale. --Shawn Carkonen",

The many clues that Laurel is different (she is strictly vegan; sunlight seems to shine through her fair skin; she never gets cold; she craves the outdoors; she doesn't menstruate) culminate in a bump on her back growing to the size of a softball and blooming into a flower that has foot-long petals. Returning to her parents' land, she meets Tamini, a faerie to whom she is attracted, who tells her that she is not human, but rather is a plant or, more specifically, a faerie. David, her accepting and supportive classmate, tests her tissue and confirms that Tamini is right. When a creepy alleged realtor pressures the family to sell the land, the teens become suspicious, and they are soon fighting for their lives in a centuries-old battle between faeries and trolls. Laurel's struggles to figure out what it means to be human are matched by her struggles to determine what it means to be a faerie, and she is torn between love for David and love for Tamini. The ending allows for many possibilities in the upcoming sequels.

Accounts of the upheaval can be breathless and even alarming, but Peter Hessler is the calmest and most companionable of correspondents. In his reporting for theNew Yorkerand in his booksRiver Town,Oracle Bones, and now the superbCountry Driving, he's observed the past 15 years of change with the patience and perspective--and necessary good humor--of an outsider who expects to be there for a while. InCountry Driving, Hessler takes to the roads, as so many Chinese are doing now for the first time, driving on dirt tracks to the desert edges of the ancient empire and on brand-new highways to the mushrooming factory towns of the globalized boom. He's modest but intrepid--having taken to heart the national philosophy that it's better to ask for forgiveness than permission--and an utterly enjoyable guide, with a humane and empathetic eye for the ambitions, the failures, and the comedy of a country in which everybody, it seems, is on the move, and no one is quite sure of the rules. --Tom Nissley",

Each has brought profound change--for instance, the remaking of the commercial and social worlds wrought by the rise of Protestantism and by the decline of hereditary monarchies. And each, Barzun hints, is too little studied or appreciated today, in a time he does not hesitate to label as decadent.To leaf through Barzun's sweeping, densely detailed but lightly written survey of the last 500 years is to ride a whirlwind of world-changing events. Barzun ponders, for instance, the tumultuous political climate of Renaissance Italy, which yielded mayhem and chaos, but also the work of Michelangelo and Leonardo--and, he adds, the scientific foundations for today's consumer culture of boom boxes and rollerblades. He considers the 16th-century varieties of religious experimentation that arose in the wake of Martin Luther's 95 theses, some of which led to the repression of individual personality, others of which might easily have come from the \"Me Decade.\" Along the way, he offers a miniature history of the detective novel, defends Surrealism from its detractors, and derides the rise of professional sports, packing in a wealth of learned and often barbed asides.Never shy of controversy, Barzun writes from a generally conservative position; he insists on the importance of moral values, celebrates the historical contributions of Christopher Columbus, and twits the academic practitioners of political correctness.

It is&mdash;deep breath now&mdash;a murder-mystery speculative-history Jewish-identity noir chess thriller, so perhaps it's no surprise that, in the back half of the book, the moving parts become unwieldy; Chabon is juggling narrative chainsaws here.The novel begins&mdash;the same way that Philip Roth launchedThe Plot Against America&mdash;with a fascinating historical footnote: what if, as Franklin Roosevelt proposed on the eve of World War II, a temporary Jewish settlement had been established on the Alaska panhandle? Roosevelt's plan went nowhere, but Chabon runs the idea into the present, back-loading his tale with a haunting history. Israel failed to get a foothold in the Middle East, and since the Sitka solution was only temporary, Alaskan Jews are about to lose their cold homeland. The book's timeless refrain: \"It's a strange time to be a Jew.\"Into this world arrives Chabon's Chandler-ready hero, Meyer Landsman, a drunken rogue cop who wakes in a flophouse to find that one of his neighbors has been murdered. With his half-Tlingit, half-Jewish partner and his sexy-tough boss, who happens also to be his ex-wife, Landsman investigates a fascinating underworld of Orthodox black-hat gangs and crime-lord rabbis. Chabon's \"Alyeska\" is an act of fearless imagination, more evidence of the soaring talent of his previous genre-blender, the Pulitzer Prize&ndash;winningThe Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay.Eventually, however, Chabon's homage to noir feels heavy-handed, with too many scenes of snappy tough-guy banter and too much of the kind of elaborate thriller plotting that requires long explanations and offscreen conspiracies.Chabon can certainly write noir&mdash;or whatever else he wants; his recent Sherlock Holmes novel,The Final Solution, was lovely, even if theNew York Times Book Reviewsniffed its surprise that the mystery novel would \"appeal to the real writer.\" Should any other snobs mistake Chabon for anything less than a real writer, this book offers new evidence of his peerless storytelling and style. Characters have skin \"as pale as a page of commentary\" and rough voices \"like an onion rolling in a bucket.\" It's a solid performance that would have been even better with a little more Yiddish and a little less police.(May)Jess Walter was a finalist for the 2006 National Book Award forThe Zeroand the winner of the 2006 Edgar Award for best novel forCitizen Vince.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

For example, players can choose to be a boy or a girl trainer, an internal clock sets events at certain times, and you&#x92;re the game's handy-dandy Pok&#xE9;dex helps players keep track of the many stats. You're main goal is still to beat all the Gym Trainers and become the Pok&#xE9;mon Master. If you've played the old games, you will be right at home. But not all is the same.The most obvious change is in the battles themselves. Now that two Pok&#xE9;mon can fight on your side at the same time, you can tag-team them against an enemy by taking advantage of the strengths of your Pok&#xE9;mons while covering their weaknesses. For example, you can now have a water Pok&#xE9;mon watch your fire Pok&#xE9;mon's back.  You can also attack more than one Pok&#xE9;mon at a time.A whole new element to the game focuses on how berries are used in battle. And if you collect enough berries, you can take them to a Berry Blender and make a Pok&#xE9;Block, which is a little super-charged candy that raises your Pok&#xE9;mon's \"Condition\" attributes. You can then groom your Pok&#xE9;mon for regional contests and compete for ribbons like \"Best of Show,\" which will unlock additional contests. There's even strategy in how to best use your berries: pick too many and the berry tree will disappear; plant berries, though, and a tree will grow. You can also build a Secret Base in special areas of the game, which you can decorate just like you can your room.And let us not forget that Pok&#xE9;mon Ruby has a kickin' multiplayer system, too.

New to this game is the ability to shake the Wii Remote for various effects. By default, a shake of the Wii Remote makes Wario punch the ground, causing a small earthquake and dazing enemies. Wario can then pick up dazed enemies and, with another shake of the Wii Remote, shake them for rejuvenating garlic and occasionally gold. Enemies can also be thrown, and you aim by tilting the Wii Remote.Wario also takes control of three different vehicles during the course of the game, all of which are piloted in part by tilting the Wii Remote.

        "B00005ME8S": "Originally released in 1998, the PC version ofHalf-Lifechanged  first-person shooters forever by proving that a compelling story can be told within  the genre. Prior to the game's release, first-person shooters were mindless  action games.Half-Life, while containing its fair share of action, also  contained plenty of exploration, puzzle, and story elements. Now released as a  PlayStation2 game,Half-Lifehas never looked or played better. This  version contains the outstanding single-player story mode, as well as a few new  ones. While the new additions aren't so great, the story mode is one of the best  escapades available on the PS2.The game follows the adventures of Gordon Freeman, a young research associate at  the Black Mesa Federal Research Facility. A typical day at the office goes  completely awry as numerous alien life forms invade the facility. The fate of  the facility, and quite possibly the world, is in the hands of an unlikely hero.The graphics here trump the original's (understandable, as more than three years  have passed). The character models have four times as many polygons, as well as  smoother textures and animations. The sound is also very good, with some of the  funniest voice acting yet heard in a game. Of course, the single-player gameplay  is excellent, thanks to some very well-developed enemy artificial intelligence.Unfortunately, the new modes aren't nearly as brilliant. Decay, the new  cooperative mode, seems like an afterthought and pales in comparison to the  cooperative modes inPerfect DarkandHalo. Deathmatches only  support two players, which is incredibly lame considering many PS2 first-person  shooters support four. Despite these flawed modes, the single-player story is so  superb that it totally warrants a purchase.--Raymond M. PadillaPros:Greatly improved graphics from the originalExcellent storytelling, especially for the genreStrong enemy artificial intelligenceCons:Cooperative mode is dullDeathmatch only supports 2 players",

Jake Mishkin, a Manhattan intellectual property attorney and a bit of a rake, goes on the run from Russian gangsters. Albert Crosetti, an aspiring filmmaker working for an antiquarian bookstore, finds that life is more exciting than movies&mdash;perhaps too exciting. Together, Mishkin and Crosetti travel to England in search of a previously unknown Shakespeare manuscript mentioned by Bracegirdle. Though the pace sometimes slows to allow Mishkin, Crosetti and Bracegirdle to divulge interesting aspects of their personal lives, these digressions only make the story more engaging. The suspense created around the double-crosses and triple-crosses works because of the close connection readers forge with Crosetti in particular. The mysterious murder of a Shakespearean scholar, shootouts in the streets of Queens and an unlikely romance all combine to make for a gripping, satisfying read.(Apr.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Slender though it is,The Writing Liferichly conveys the torturous, tortuous, and in rare moments, transcendent existence of the writer. Even for Dillard, whose prose is so mellifluous as to seem effortless, the act of writing can seem a Sisyphean task: \"When you write,\" she says, \"you lay out a line of words.... Soon you find yourself deep in new territory. Is it a dead end, or have you located the real subject? You will know tomorrow or this time next year.\" Amid moving accounts of her own writing (and life) experiences, Dillard also manages to impart wisdom to other writers, wisdom having to do with passion and commitment and taking the work seriously. \"One of the few things I know about writing is this: spend it all, shoot it, play it, lose it, all, right away, every time. Do not hoard what seems good for a later place.... Something more will arise for later, something better.\" And, if that is not enough, \"Assume you write for an audience consisting solely of terminal patients,\" she says. \"That is, after all, the case.... What could you say to a dying person that would not enrage by its triviality?\"This all makesThe Writing Lifeseem a dense, tough read, but that is not the case at all. Dillard is, after all, human, just like the rest of us. During one particularly frantic moment, four cups of coffee and not much writing down, Dillard comes to a realization: \"Many fine people were out there living, people whose consciences permitted them to sleep at night despite their not having written a decent sentence that day, or ever.\"--Jane Steinberg",

Rachel enjoys cocaine, alcohol and meeting men in bars, especially men wearing tight leather pants. She can match anybody's hilarious anecdotes about a Catholic childhood, but recently her life's gone awry, and God has become \"more like a celestial stand-up comic\" than a \"benign old guy with long hair.\" When she wakes up in a hospital emergency room and finds she's been diagnosed as a suicidal drug addict, she's enraged. She's also broke and unemployed, and her boyfriend has abandoned her. As a final indignity, her father takes her back home and books her into Dublin's Betty Ford-like clinic, the Cloisters. Famous for a clientele of rock stars, it should be a glamorous spa, but it isn't. Quarters are spartan, clients do housework and group therapy is humiliating. It could be worse, though, and there's one good-looking fellow-inmate who might, or might not, be a lifeline post-Cloisters. This novel isn't a how-to on overcoming addiction but an examination, often comic, of treatment that is expected to result in personality changes necessary for recovery. Smart-ass Rachel actually becomes a beguiling heroine after learning to wake up and cook eggs at about the same time in the morning she used to fall into somebody's bed in New York. Clever badinage (\"the only way to get over one man is get under another\") unfortunately sometimes gives way to phrases like \"pantie-meltingly gorgeous.\" The narrative is overlong, and the characters rarely speakAthey yell or shriekAbut, overall, Keyes's stylish wit keeps readers attentive, and her take on addiction is insightful and compassionate.

And you don't have to look beyond the titles to understand the allure; who could pass up a book calledPractical DemonkeepingorIsland of the Sequined Love Nun? Each of Moore's tales skewers a particular literary genre. InCoyote Bluehe nailed New Age fascination with Native American religion; inBlood-Sucking Fiends: A Love Storyhe put a new twist on the classic vampire tale.The Lust Lizard of Melancholy Coveis a companion piece to his first novel, the hilariously twisted horror storyPractical Demonkeeping, and readers of that book will recognize the setting, Pine Cove, California. In addition, Moore includes plenty of his patented weird sex, occasional gross-out death, several off-kilter but nonetheless affecting love stories, and some fabulous secondary characters such as Mavis Sand:Mavis first began augmenting her parts in the fifties, first out of vanity: breasts, eyelashes, hair. Later, as she aged and the concept of maintenance eluded her, she began having parts replaced as they failed, until almost half of her body weight was composed of stainless steel (hips, elbows, shoulders, finger joints, rods fused to vertebrae five through twelve), silicon wafers (hearing aids, pacemaker, insulin pump), advanced polymer resins (cataract replacement lenses, dentures), Kevlar fabric (abdominal wall reinforcement), titanium (knees, ankles), and pork (ventricular heart valve).In a nutshell, the plot revolves around a gigantic prehistoric lizard whose slumber deep beneath the ocean surface is interrupted by a radioactive leak from a nearby power plant. At the same time, a woman in Pine Cove hangs herself; the local psychiatrist (who has been prescribing antidepressants to everyone in town with gay abandon) decides the suicide was her fault and yanks everyone's medication; and an elderly black blues singer named Catfish Jefferson arrives to perform at the Head of the Slug saloon.  Into this already strange brew mix one schizoid former B-movie starlet, a pot-head town constable, a bereaved local artist, a biologist tracking anomalous behavior in rats, a crooked sheriff, and a pharmacist with a bizarre sexual fixation on sea mammals, and you have a recipe for the kind of madness Moore does so well.--Alix Wilber--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

Meanwhile, Annie&#x2019;s ex-husband, Orion, struggles to accept Annie&#x2019;s remarriage and remake himself after messing up his career as a psychologist. And their kids are not exactly all right either. But, in classic Lamb fashion, this is less a story about the drama of the present or any of the various hot-button issues Lamb invokes (gay marriage, Christian Fundamentalism, Obama&#x2019;s presidency) than it is a lesson about how the traumas of the past play themselves out in the present, and how moral courage and religious faith are the key to overcoming that which haunts us. Here the old wounds are deep indeed&#x2014;abandonment, addiction, decades-old racial conflict, and lots of child abuse&#x2014;and Lamb does not hold back describing them in all their messiness.

Citing Plato, Buddha and modern brain science, psychologist Haidt notes the mind is like an \"elephant\" of automatic desires and impulses atop which conscious intention is an ineffectual \"rider.\" Haidt sifts Eastern and Western religious and philosophical traditions for other nuggets of wisdom to substantiate&mdash;and sometimes critique&mdash;with the findings of neurology and cognitive psychology. The Buddhist-Stoic injunction to cast off worldly attachments in pursuit of happiness, for example, is backed up by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's studies into pleasure. And Nietzsche's contention that what doesn't kill us makes us stronger is considered against research into post-traumatic growth. An exponent of the \"positive psychology\" movement, Haidt also offers practical advice on finding happiness and meaning. Riches don't matter much, he observes, but close relationships, quiet surroundings and short commutes help a lot, while meditation, cognitive psychotherapy and Prozac are equally valid remedies for constitutional unhappiness. Haidt sometimes seems reductionist, but his is an erudite, fluently written, stimulating reassessment of age-old issues.(Jan.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The magic of the Wii Remote's design lies within; acellerometers inside the controller body measure movement in all directions and at all speeds. In a tennis game, it serves as your racket as you swing your arm for a long forehand or a quick and hard backhand. In a 4x4 driving game it serves as a steering wheel, allowing you to swerve to avoid obstacles or pickup power-ups. In first-person shooters, the Wii Remote acts as a firearm that you can point directly at an on-screen enemy.

On the face of the remote are the D (or \"plus\") pad, a large \"A\" button which is used for major on-screen actions, and two small options buttons. Between the game buttons are a plus and minus buttons (which often act as \"forwards\" and \"back\"), as well as a \"Home\" button to engage the Wii home screen to change settings or check remote battery levels. On the back side of the controller is a trigger-like \"B\" button, perfect for timing releases of a bowling roll inWii Sports.Thankfully, battery life is excellent with the two included AA batteries, just as with the previous generation of Nintendo wireless controllers.Immersive intelligenceAlong the bottom of the Wii Remote, four blue LED lights indicate which player position the remote is currently set to. The controller automatically connects to the Wii console via Bluetooth wireless technology. Below the LEDs, an expansion port lets you connect a number of devices including the Nunchuck and Classic controllers for Virtual Console gaming (Virtual Console games and controller accessories sold separately). Other features of the Wii Remote include adjustable rumble force-feedback and a reinforced wrist strap to ensure safe use. A speaker inside the remote gives the player feedback about the strength of swings or the accuracy of their moves- such as realistic tennis noises as the \"racket\" connects with the ball inWii Sports.

They find themselves traveling back to Planet Veldin to battle Dr. Nefarious, a robotic supervillain who has devised a diabolical scheme to wipe out all organic life in the galaxy. To reach his goal, he has instructed the Tyhrranoids, a race of multi-eye aliens to annihilate the organics. However, while Dr. Nefarious is aware that if the Tyhrranoids are successful, they will end up causing their own extinction, the Tyhrranoids are not aware of this danger.To fight back, Ratchet and Clank are able to recruit Captain Qwark, a favorite from previous games, out of retirement to lead the Q-Force, an unlikely band of heroic space cadets comprised of some of the most memorable characters from the Ratchet & Clank franchise.

A great deal of the puzzles  require the player to create a safe path for Yorda, who isn't physically able to  get to the places Ico can. The puzzles are quite brilliant, although a few are  so tough that players will feel like ditching the princess.Graphics, particularly the lighting effects and animations, are fantastic. The  developers did a superb job of conveying the enormity and beauty of the castle.  When Ico and Yorda move and interact, their actions seem totally lifelike. The  ambient soundtrack and simple controls let the player focus on the tasks at  hand. Sony has crafted a very unique game that anyone can play. Few games are as  elegant in their simplicity as this puzzler from Sony.--Raymond M.

        "0060513608": "The events of September 11 have seemingly been covered, analyzed, and discussed from every angle imaginable. So the subject matter alone of Jim DeFede'sThe Day the World Came to Townmakes it noteworthy. In the immediate aftermath of the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, 38 commercial airliners carrying over 6,000 passengers were forced, as a precautionary measure, to land in Gander, Newfoundland, Canada. Due to the ongoing closure of U.S. airspace, the passengers spent four days in this isolated town of 10,000 before being allowed to continue on their way. In that time, Gander's residents rallied together to extend a kind of hospitality that seems too expansive for the wordhospitality. Townspeople not only opened schools and legion halls for use as emergency shelters, they invited the passengers into their homes for showers, meals, and warm beds while local businesses simply gave toiletries and clothing to passengers stuck without luggage. Despite the grim consequences that led to the situation, DeFede finds humor: two flight attendants are offered a car for sightseeing by a local woman who happened to be driving by; the stranded chairman of Hugo Boss finds himself shopping for men's underwear at the local Wal-Mart. But the real message of the book is how, even in times of great turmoil and conflict, people can and must look to one another for comfort, help, and hope.--John Moe",

        "B00005ULXN": "Sega's mascot made his 3-D debut on the Dreamcast, but with the demise  of that system the zippy blue hedgehog is popping up everywhere--including on  the GameCube. Unfortunately, his first next-gen appearance,Sonic Adventure  2: Battle, is marred by the same 3-D camera problems that plagued the  Dreamcast version, and the multiplayer \"battle\" component isn't all that it's  cracked up to be.Right out of the gate, players have the option of choosing Hero (Sonic, Tails,  and Knuckles) or Dark (Dr. Eggman, Shadow, and Rouge) quests, which are  completely different. Sonic and his dark counterpart Shadow traverse levels at  warp speed colleting coins and power-ups while fighting enemies in the game's  most exhilarating moments. Unfortunately, the other characters are nowhere near  as fun to play. Dr. Eggman and Tails fight through levels that require little  more than constant button-mashing to shoot an endless procession of enemies, and  Knuckles and Rouge participate in seemingly endless levels that require  searching for a variety of objects.Graphically, the game is a bit of a letdown considering the processing muscle of  GameCube. Models are fairly simplistic, and level textures are sometimes bland.  Game Boy Advance owners can use a link cable to download Chao from the game and  train them on the go, but the rewards for doing so are minor considering the  time investment involved. The main feature this game offers over its Dreamcast  predecessor is the variety of multiplayer modes, which are fun but offer none of  the depth or replayability of standalone multiplayer games likeSuper Smash  Bros. Melee. Still, they are nice additions--especially the racing  games--and round out a flawed single-player component. Sonic addicts who missed this  game the first time around on the Dreamcast will definitely want to check it  out, but the finicky camera, tedious non-Sonic/Shadow levels in single-player  mode, and surprisingly shallow multiplayer components (especially the Chao  games) turn what could have been a great game into a mere good one.--T.

        "0061578916": "Book Description\"The greatest writer of historical adventures today\" (Washington Post) tackles his richest, most thrilling subject yet--the heroic tale of Agincourt.Young Nicholas Hook is dogged by a cursed past--haunted by what he has failed to do and banished for what he has done. A wanted man in England, he is driven to fight as a mercenary archer in France, where he finds two things he can love: his instincts as a fighting man, and a girl in trouble. Together they survive the notorious massacre at Soissons, an event that shocks all Christendom. With no options left, Hook heads home to England, where his capture means certain death. Instead he is discovered by the young King of England--Henry V himself--and by royal command he takes up the longbow again and dons the cross of Saint George. Hook returns to France as part of the superb army Henry leads in his quest to claim the French crown. But after the English campaign suffers devastating early losses, it becomes clear that Hook and his fellow archers are their king's last resort in a desperate fight against an enemy more daunting than they could ever have imagined.One of the most dramatic victories in British history, the battle of Agincourt--immortalized by Shakespeare inHenry V--pitted undermanned and overwhelmed English forces against a French army determined to keep their crown out of Henry's hands. Here Bernard Cornwell resurrects the legend of the battle and the \"band of brothers\" who fought it on October 25, 1415. An epic of redemption,Agincourtfollows a commoner, a king, and a nation's entire army on an improbable mission to test the will of God and reclaim what is rightfully theirs. From the disasters at the siege of Harfleur to the horrors of the field of Agincourt, this exhilarating story of survival and slaughter is at once a brilliant work of history and a triumph of imagination&#8212;Bernard Cornwell at his best.Historical Notes onAgincourtby Bernard CornwellThe battle of Agincourt (Azincourt was and remains the French spelling) was one of the most remarkable events of medieval Europe, a battle whose reputation far outranked its importance. In the long history of Anglo-French rivalry only Hastings, Waterloo, Trafalgar, and Cr&#233;cy share Agincourt&#x2019;s renown. It is arguable that Poitiers was a more significant battle and an even more complete victory, or that Verneuil was just as astonishing a triumph, and it&#x2019;s certain that Hastings, Blenheim, Victoria, Trafalgar, and Waterloo were more influential on the course of history, yet Agincourt still holds its extraordinary place in English legend. Something quite remarkable happened on 25 October 1415 (Agincourt was fought long before Christendom&#x2019;s conversion to the new-style calendar, so the modern anniversary should be on 4 November). It was something so remarkable that its fame persists almost six hundred years later.Agincourt&#x2019;s fame could just be an accident, a quirk of history reinforced by Shakespeare&#x2019;s genius, but the evidence suggests it really was a battle that sent a shock wave through Europe. For years afterward the French called 25 October 1415la malheureuse journ&#233;e(the unfortunate day). Even after they had expelled the English from France they remembered la malheureuse journ&#233;e with sadness. It had been a disaster.Yet it was so nearly a disaster for Henry V and his small, but well-equipped army. That army had sailed from Southampton Water with high hopes, the chief of which was the swift capture of Harfleur, which would be followed by a foray into the French heartland in hope, presumably, of bringing the French to battle. A victory in that battle would demonstrate, at least in the pious Henry&#x2019;s mind, God&#x2019;s support of his claim to the French throne, and might even propel him onto that throne. Such hopes were not vain when his army was intact, but the siege of Harfleur took much longer than expected and Henry&#x2019;s army was almost ruined by dysentery.The tale of the siege in the novel is, by and large, accurate, though I did take one great liberty, which was to sink a mineshaft opposite the Leure Gate. There was no such shaft, the ground would not allow it, and all the real mines were dug by the Duke of Clarence&#x2019;s forces that were assailing the eastern side of Harfleur. The French counter-mines defeated those diggings, but I wanted to give a flavor, however inadequately, of the horrors men faced in fighting beneath the earth. The defense of Harfleur was magnificent, for which much of the praise must go to Raoul de Gaucourt, one of the garrison&#x2019;s leaders. His defiance, and the long days of the siege, gave the French a chance to raise a much larger army than any they might have fielded against Henry if the siege had ended, say, in early September.Maps of the Battlefield (Click to Enlarge)England and France, 1415:One of the most dramatic victories in British history, the battle of Agincourt--immortalized by Shakespeare inHenry V--pitted undermanned and overwhelmed English forces against a French army determined to keep their crown out of Henry's hands.The French Coast:The British campaign, which started at Harfleur, ended more than two months later on 25 October at Agincourt.Harfleur:Henry's army landed in northern France on 13 August 1415 and besieged the port of Harfleur.The Battle Lines:&#x201C;We few, we happy few, we band of brothers; For he today who sheds his blood with me shall be my brother.&#x201D; &#x2013; William Shakespeare,Henry V",

        "0060530677": "It may seem a stretch to connect a volcanic eruption with civil and  religious unrest in Indonesia today, but Simon Winchester makes a  compelling case.Krakatoatells the frightening tale of the  biggest volcanic eruption in history using a blend of gentle geology and  narrative history. Krakatoa erupted at a time when technologies like the  telegraph were becoming commonplace and Asian trade routes were being  expanded by northern European companies. This bustling colonial backdrop  provides an effective canvas for the suspense leading up to August 27th,  1883, when the nearby island of Krakatoa would violently vaporize.  Winchester describes the eruption through the eyes of its survivors, and  readers will be as horrified and mesmerized as eyewitnesses were as the  death toll reached nearly 40,000 (almost all of whom died from tsunamis  generated by the unimaginably strong shock waves of the eruption). Ships  were thrown miles inshore, endless rains of hot ash engulfed those towns  not drowned by 100 foot waves, and vast rafts of pumice clogged the hot  sea. The explosion was heard thousands of miles away, and the eruption's  shock wave traveled around the world seven times. But the book's biggest  surprise is not the riveting catalog of the volcano's effects; rather,  it is Winchester's contention that the Dutch abandonment of their  Indonesian colonies after the disaster left local survivors to seek  comfort in radical Islam, setting the stage for a volatile future for  the region.--Therese Littleton--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

The story centers on Vietnam veteran George Washington Hayduke III, who returns to the desert to find his beloved canyons and rivers threatened by industrial development. On a rafting trip down the Colorado River, Hayduke joins forces with feminist saboteur Bonnie Abbzug, wilderness guide Seldom Seen Smith, and billboard torcher Doc Sarvis, M.D., and together they wander off to wage war on the big yellow machines, on dam builders and road builders and strip miners.

The bodies of most overeaters are continually in a state of hyperinsulinism; their bodies are so adept at releasing insulin to help convert excess carbohydrates to fat that there's always too much of the hormone circulating through the body. This puts the body into a bind; it always wants to store fat. Even when people with hyperinsulinism try to lose weight--especially when they cut fat but increase carbohydrate consumption--their efforts will fail. This is why Dr. Atkins refers to insulin as &quot;the fat-producing hormone.&quot;Dr. Atkins's diet is extremely low in carbohydrates, which helps to regulate insulin production and decrease circulating insulin; less insulin soon results in less fat storage and fewer food cravings. The diet is far from torturous, though--those who've tried it attest that hunger isnota part of this plan. Ninety percent of Dr. Atkins's patients--more than 25,000 of them--have experienced dramatic weight loss.

When her mother remarries, Suze moves from New York City to California, where she and her three stepbrothers attend a Catholic academy headed by a priest. Conveniently, the priest is also a mediator (the first of her kind that Suze has ever met). During the course of this rather repetitious and intermittently sluggish caper, Suze encounters two ghosts: a handsome young man from the 19th century who haunts her bedroom and a girl who was a student at the academy until she killed herself when Bryce, her boyfriend, broke up with her. As Suze attempts to protect Bryce from the angry apparition's wrath, the ghostly girl grows determined to get revenge on both her former beau and Suze. Suze finally resorts to an exorcism to get rid of her. As a narrator this teen is a bit too tough-talking and cocky to be credible.

Upon returning, they notice a new world, and there is a world war taking place between three groups for control of the world.Play As Three Different Factions for Varied game playIn Red Alert 3, you have the choice to play as the Allies, the Soviets, or the Empire of the Rising Sun. Each faction has its own story-line and distinct units with advantages and disadvantages that you have to master in order to win. The new faction to the series is the Empire of the Rising Sun, derived from Imperial Japan, with an all-new cast of units and characters.The three factions have many differences, exemplified by their wildly different types of units. The Soviets, for example, have armored attack bears, Allies have the Dolphin ship which can high jump and use a sonic attack, and the Empire of the Rising Sun features such quirky units as a giant transforming mecha and ninjas.

Enzo is a lab terrier mix plucked from a farm outside Seattle to ride shotgun with race car driver Denny Swift as he pursues success on the track and off. Denny meets and marries Eve, has a daughter, Zo&euml;, and risks his savings and his life to make it on the professional racing circuit. Enzo, frustrated by his inability to speak and his lack of opposable thumbs, watches Denny's old racing videos, coins koanlike aphorisms that apply to both driving and life, and hopes for the day when his life as a dog will be over and he can be reborn a man. When Denny hits an extended rough patch, Enzo remains his most steadfast if silent supporter. Enzo is a reliable companion and a likable enough narrator, though the string of Denny's bad luck stories strains believability.

Wells, andSphere, his thriller about a mysterious spherical spaceship at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, is classic Crichton. A group of not-very-complex characters (portrayed in the film by Sharon Stone, Dustin Hoffman, Samuel L. Jackson, and Queen Latifah) assemble to solve a cleverly designed roller coaster of a mystery while attempting (with mixed success) to avoid sudden death and expounding (much more successfully) on the latest, coolest scientific ideas, including the existence of black holes. Somehow, Crichton manages to convey the complicated stuff in utterly simplistic prose, making him, as his old pal Steven Spielberg puts it, &quot;the high priest of high concept.&quot; Yet there is more to Crichton than science and big-ticket show biz. He is also, as any reader of his startling memoirTravelsknows, a bit of a mystic--he is entirely open to notions spouted by spoon-bending psychics that most science writers would scorn.Sphereis not only a gratifying sci-fi suspense tale; it also reflects Crichton's keen interest in the unexplained powers of the human mind. When something passes through a black hole in Crichton's fiction, a lesson is learned. The book also contains another profound lesson: when you're staring down a giant squid with an eyeball the size of a dinner plate, don't blink first.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

Popular high-school swimming star Chris Harte and talented artist Em Gold bonded as infants; their parents have been next-door neighbors and best friends for 18 years. When they fall in love, everyone is ecstatic. Everyone, it turns out, except for Em, who finds that sex with Chris feels almost incestuous. Her emotional turmoil, compounded by pregnancy, which she keeps secret, leads to depression, despair and a desire for suicide, and she insists that Chris prove his love by pulling the trigger. The gun is fired in the first paragraph, and so the book opens with a jolt of adrenaline. But Picoult stumbles in delineating both sets of parents' responses to the tragedy. Unconvincing behavior and dialogue inappropriate to the situation (plus, most importantly, the fact that the parents fail to discuss crucial topics) never touch the essence of bereavement and thus destroy credibility. Picoult redeems herself in flashbacks that reveal the two marital relationships and the personalities of both couples; and she sensitively explores the question of how well parents can ever know their children. After Chris is accused of murder and jailed, the narrative acquires impressive authenticity and suspense, with even the minor characters evoked with Picoult's keen eye for telling detail. The courtroom scenes (reminiscent of Picoult's 1996 novel, Mercy), are taut and well paced. Readers may remain unconvinced, however, that an intelligent young man like Chris would not have sought some help rather than respond to his lover's desperate request.

Despite the fact that Helen and Lucas were from enemy Houses and wanted to kill each other in Starcrossed, they fell in love and then discovered that they were first cousins. Now, they're finding it hard to resist their mutual attration, despite knowing its wrong. Then Orion shows up to rival Lucas for Helen's affections. Helen can fly and throw lightning bolts but makes mistakes and, like all the Gods, is guilty of hubris. She finds herself in horrific situations and the only way she can end each night so she can wake up to try again is to die - by quicksand, falling, etc.-and this is taking a terrible physical toll on her. The violence that the Gods and demigods inflict upon one another is compelling, but also brutal. Enough of the events from Starcrossed are recounted that it's not essential to have read it first.

        "0062008110": "The main drama in Bronte's novel happens in a long narrative told by an elderly housekeeper to a convalescing new tenant. This story-within-a-story setup makes it well suited for audio adaptation, as Scales takes the housekeeper's part and relates the past, while West performs as the tenant and describes the present. Scales primarily uses a folksy lower-class accent, but she also makes her voice harsh and threatening when speaking as Heathcliff, the surly man at the novel's heart. West, as the bewildered tenant, manages to sound both nervous and pretentious, but his part is fairly small, especially with this abridgment, so he mostly serves to provide transitions for the housekeeper's story. The extensive abridgment generally deletes sentences and phrases rather than entire paragraphs or sections. One drawback for the audio format is the difficulty of clarifying the novel's convoluted plot and family tree, since it's harder to search back through long CD tracks than through earlier chapters of the paperback. While a little of the depth of Bronte's writing is lost in abridgment, the novel's emotional core remains intact and wrenching, and the actors' heartfelt interpretations make it easy to imagine being curled up by a warm fire listening to an absorbing tale.

        "0061732370": "Product DescriptionThe life Kamila Sidiqi had known changed overnight when the Taliban seized control of the city of Kabul. After receiving a teaching degree during the civil war&mdash;a rare achievement for any Afghan woman&mdash;Kamila was subsequently banned from school and confined to her home. When her father and brother were forced to flee the city, Kamila became the sole breadwinner for her five siblings. Armed only with grit and determination, she picked up a needle and thread and created a thriving business of her own.The Dressmaker of Khair Khanatells the incredible true story of this unlikely entrepreneur who mobilized her community under the Taliban. Former ABC News reporter Gayle Tzemach Lemmon spent years on the ground reporting Kamila's story, and the result is an unusually intimate and unsanitized look at the daily lives of women in Afghanistan. These women are not victims; they are the glue that holds families together; they are the backbone and the heart of their nation.  Afghanistan's future remains uncertain as debates over withdrawal timelines dominate the news.The Dressmaker of Khair Khanamoves beyond the headlines to transport you to an Afghanistan you have never seen before. This is a story of war, but it is also a story of sisterhood and resilience in the face of despair. Kamila Sidiqi's journey will inspire you, but it will also change the way you think about one of the most important political and humanitarian issues of our time.Amazon Exclusive: Greg Mortenson Interviews Gayle Tzemach LemmonSince a 1993 climb of Pakistan's K2,Greg Mortensonhas worked in rural Afghanistan and Pakistan to promote education and literacy--establishing 145 schools, primarily for girls, which provide education to over 64,000 students, including 52,000 females. He is a co-author ofThe New York TimesbestsellersThree Cups of TeaandStones Into Schools.Greg Mortenson:InThe Dressmaker of Khair Khana, Kamila and her sisters sew a collection of wedding dresses overnight for a wedding party they later find out is connected to the Taliban. How did writing this book affect your view of the Taliban period?Gayle Tzemach Lemmon:That scene in the book captures precisely the extraordinary complexity of the period. Reporting on the Taliban period I quickly learned there were many different views of what those years were like, depending on who you were, what you did, and where you lived. A lot of women I knew, including, of course, Kamila, told me stories about local Talibs who knew of their work and even helped them to keep it going.  And they said that many of the Taliban in their neighborhood were men they had known for years who simply needed to support their families.What I kept coming back to&mdash;and what moved me deeply during so many conversations  with young women , some of them tearful&mdash;was the raw loss they felt at having been deprived of five and a half years of education.  And yet even amid all that despair they found ways to come together to build a community for the sake of their families.  We are so used to seeing women as victims of war to be pitied rather than survivors of war to be respected.  I really hopeThe Dressmaker of Khair Khanadoes its small part to change that.Mortenson:How has your work at Harvard Business School informed your view of Afghanistan&rsquo;s predicament?Lemmon:My experience at HBS has made me even more keenly aware of the constellation of obstacles facing entrepreneurs in some of the toughest parts of the world. That&rsquo;s perhaps why I am so taken by stories of entrepreneurs like Kamila who succeed every day despite all the obstacles (and sometimes even because of them).Economic growth strengthens families and communities. More attention must be paid by Afghanistan&rsquo;s leaders and the international community to the importance of making business easier for entrepreneurs, so they can spend time making money to support their families and less time fighting red tape, corruption and security obstacles.Mortenson:In many ways,The Dressmaker of Khair Khanareads like a novel, and yet it is all true. How much energy did you focus on the craft of storytelling vs. the reporting itself?Lemmon:I believe in the power of stories to shape and change our world. The Dressmaker happens to be set in Afghanistan during the Taliban, but it could just as easily have been the US during the Civil War or the UK during World War II. Storytelling allows us to see just how similar our struggles really are. My hope was that my godmother and my aunt, who will never go to Afghanistan, could pick up this book and see themselves in this universal story of family and faith.For me, the reporting is where the joy is&mdash;it&rsquo;s a privilege to be allowed to take a step into people&rsquo;s lives and to be entrusted with telling their story. In this case the reporting was much more physically difficult than the storytelling&mdash;the fall of 2008 in particular was a time during which kidnappings and bombings became regular occurrences in Kabul; both Afghans and foreigners I visited with constantly swapped stories of terrifying incidents which involved their friends and relatives. I knew a lot of people who were affected by the violence, and all the insecurity made it much harder to convince young women to speak with me about their experiences.Mortenson:You&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time on the ground in Afghanistan. What is it like to travel there as a young woman?Lemmon:I love going to Afghanistan, though the trip from California is nearly 40 hours. It is a beautiful country with incredibly generous people who will give you anything they have even if it is all they have. (And I highly recommend the food!)Being a young woman actually made my work easier. I could meet women of all ages and spend time with them at their homes hearing their stories and sharing my own.  This is a world many foreign men will never have access to, for cultural reasons. I also could meet Afghan men because, as a foreign woman, you sort of fit a third category&mdash;not male, but not exactly female, either. I worked hard to build trust with those women and men who entrusted me with their stories&mdash;I tried to learn Dari and to draw as little attention to my &lsquo;foreign-ness&rsquo; as possible: I often was the frumpiest woman I saw all day in my uniform of black pants, black socks, black shoes, black t-shirt, and a dark jacket and head scarf. I think those I wrote about respected the fact that I kept coming back to Afghanistan.Mortenson:You've worked and studied in conflict and post-conflict regions such as Rwanda, Bosnia and Afghanistan. Women are rarely involved in the high level decision making that affects conflict negotiations or even consulted about their own creative ideas for resolution. How can we help and empower women to play a much larger role in resolving conflicts?Lemmon:This is a question I think about all the time. We are used to women pulling families through war, but having no say in the peace which follows. This must change for the world to be a safer, more stable place.A great example has been set by the women of Liberia, who insisted their voices be heeded when it came time for UN negotiations to end their nation&rsquo;s civil war. (There is a great film about their push to be heard called &ldquo;Pray the Devil Back to Hell.&rdquo;) Afghan women, too, are speaking up to make sure that no peace negotiations happen without their real and substantive representation. Each one of us can help advance their cause and this effort by insisting that our own elected officials don&rsquo;t take part in any talks in which women don&rsquo;t take part. Holding our own leaders accountable is a great place to start.",

But when she visits a fortune-teller with a trio of mismatched friends, a marriage is predicted for the near future. When the fortune-teller's prophecies for the other three come true in peculiar ways, even disbelieving, boyfriendless Lucy begins to suspect that, somehow, wedding bells will ring for her. The identity of the lucky man will come as no surprise, though Lucy remains oblivious until the very end, but there are many eligible bachelors on the scene, among them Gus, Lucy's sexy but unreliable new lover; Daniel, her oldest friend; Chuck, a handsome American; and Adrian, the video shop man. The attendant mayhem includes drunken meals at ethnic restaurants, flamenco dancing accidents, blind dates gone wrong and many delicious confessions and revelations. As Lucy says, \"I was still at that stage in my life when I thought that weekdays were for recovering from the weekend,\" but more often than not, her weekdays are as full of exhausting fun as her weekends.

It&rsquo;s quite a startling device (I loved it in Joshua Ferris&rsquo;sThen We Came to the End). Why did you use it inThe Most Dangerous Thing?Laura Lippman:The decision was intuitive at first&mdash;that is, I knew it was right, without knowing why it was right. When I finished the book, I realized that these passages are a consensual version of what happened in the past, that the survivors have agreed on what happened and that&rsquo;s why the story is, at turns, unflattering to each of them. They are working out their level of culpability in several tragedies and they just can&rsquo;t face this alone. And that voice allowed me to include a subtext of gloom and foreboding&mdash;the story is being told by people who know how badly it ends.KA:Do you think you write better now than you did when you first began to write novels? (I only ask because I think I&rsquo;m a much better writer than I used to be but no one else seems to have noticed.) Do you feel you can trust your &ldquo;inner critic&rdquo; or are you plagued by doubts the whole time you are writing?LL:At the risk of sounding obsequious, I have to say that you set the bar awfully high for yourself withBehind the Scenes at the Museum, but I&rsquo;ve noticed how your work has changed, although I think the word that comes to mind isn&rsquo;t better, but bolder. You take such big risks and yet you manage them with aplomb. The frustration of being a fan of your work is that there&rsquo;s nothing quite like it. There are lots of wonderful writers in crime and literary fiction, but there&rsquo;s only person who can write a Kate Atkinson novel.I didn&rsquo;t start out on the same level.

Do you think that&rsquo;s due to your background as a reporter butting up against real lives rather than fictional ones? Or because you&rsquo;re a woman? Or just a decent human being?LL:All of the above? At least, I hope I&rsquo;m a decent person. I do think crime writers need to take a moment for introspection about the stories we&rsquo;re telling and the bodies that are piling up around us. It&rsquo;s somber stuff. There should be an agenda beyond sensation.KA:How many novels do you have on the back burner at any one time? Have you ever sat down to write and not had any idea what you were going to do?LL:Once&mdash;just once&mdash;I managed to have two projects going on simultaneously, a novel and a novella. I do best with one thing in front of me. And, increasingly, I have no idea what I&rsquo;m going to write next. But that&rsquo;s part of the job and, for me, part of the fun. I know a book is finished when I&rsquo;m ready to sit down and ask myself, &ldquo;What next, what interests me right now?&rdquo; WithThe Most Dangerous Thing, I was interested in the way life becomes a kind of horror film at middle age. About two months after I started this book, my father-in-law died after a long decline. About the same time, one of my husband&rsquo;s oldest friends, dating back to his days on the college newspaper, had a stroke at the age of 48, and died within hours. Yesterday, I picked upThe New York Timesand happened on a first-person piece by a former colleague, who wrote about having ALS and his intention to commit suicide while he was still able-bodied. He's only 66.But I also became a parent for the first time last year, which isn&rsquo;t one of the typical milestones of middle-age, yet there it was. And it had a huge impact on the book.KA:Do you feel guilty when you&rsquo;re not writing, even when the other thing you&rsquo;re doing is totally fulfilling or completely altruistic or utterly well deserved?LL:If I&rsquo;ve been disciplined&mdash;gone to my desk every weekday morning, written at least 1,000 words&mdash;I seldom feel guilty. I feel much more guilt-ridden about not reading enough.But I will steal a line from Anne Lamott, who once said if people knew how good she felt writing they would set her on fire.

        "0060628391": "When Richard Foster began writingCelebration of Disciplinemore than 20 years ago, an older writer gave him a bit of advice: \"Be sure that every chapter forces the reader into the next chapter.\" Foster took the advice to heart; as a result, his book presents one of the most compelling and readable visions of Christian spirituality published in the past few decades. After beginning with a simple observation--\"Superficiality is the curse of our age.... The desperate need today is not for a greater number of intelligent people, or gifted people, but for deep people\"--Foster's book moves to explain the disciplines people must cultivate in order to achieve spiritual depth. In succinct, urgent, and sometimes humorous chapters, Foster defines a broad range of classic spiritual disciplines in terms that are lucid without being too limiting and offers advice that's practical without being overly prescriptive. For instance, after describing meditation as a combination of \"intense intimacy and awful reverence,\" he settles into such down-to-earth topics as how to choose a place and a posture in which to meditate.Perhaps most interesting and useful is Foster's chapter on the controversial Christian discipline of submission. According to Foster, submission does not demand self-hatred or loss of identity. Instead, it simply means growing secure in the conviction that \"our happiness is not dependent on getting what we want\" but on the fulfillment that naturally flows from love of one's neighbors. Such wise and encouraging suggestions have helped many readers to discard the idea that discipline is an onerous duty and to move toward a liberating and simpler idea of discipline--whose defining character, as Foster never forgets, is joy.--Michael Joseph Gross",

FBI deputy assistant director Kate Bannon tracks down Steve Vail, a maverick FBI agent who left the bureau for a new life as a Chicago bricklayer, because she needs Vail's help in apprehending a criminal gang, the Rubaco Pentad, with a grudge against the FBI. The Pentad follows up the murder of L.A. reporter Connie Lysander, who wrote a story critical of the FBI, with ever-increasing demands for money from the bureau to forestall future killings and the setting of sophisticated death traps. When an agent disappears while making a payoff to the gang, he becomes a prime suspect, despite Vail's reservations. Predictable plot elements include the hero's incredible escapes from peril and the growing romantic bond between the laconic Vail and the attractive Bannon.

But in Lehane&rsquo;s hands, the Prohibition-era tale of Joe Coughlin&rsquo;s rise to criminal power is both fresh and nuanced, packed with guns, booze, and babes as it roars from Boston to Tampa to Cuba. As Coughlin crosses deeper into the dark side--among those who &ldquo;live by night and dance fast&rdquo;--he provokes the question that sustains this propulsive narrative: Can a man be a good mobster and a good person at the same time? Incredibly, Lehane, who becomes more masterful with each book, has us rooting for Coughlin even as he slowly becomes the kind of monster mobster he once reviled and rebelled against. --Neal Thompson",

        "B00005Y4Q1": "Unreal II: The Awakeningreturns to the fascinating futuristic setting ofUnreal, first visited in 1998. Since then we've had to content ourselves with the excellentUnreal Tournamentmultiplayer combat series. For this first true sequel Epic Games hired Legend Entertainment, who made a name for themselves with theUnreal: Return to Na Paliexpansion pack and the woefully underratedWheel of Timegame (based on the books by Robert Jordan). The result is fun and frantic, if a bit too short-lived.Unreal II's best feature is its lush graphics engine. It's state of the art. All the locations, which range from bizarre alien worlds to those based on the filmAlien, exude dynamic realism. Human and alien characters are well-animated and rendered, but have a cartoonish exaggeration that clashes with the realism of the architecture. The designers were undoubtedly shooting for a comic-book look, which explains why the women look like blow-up dolls with bare midriffs and the men have hulking muscles. The monsters, too, ripple with strength and menace. This style will please some, but is less effective than the more realistic styles employed by similar titles--although at least the art direction is consistent throughout the game.Unrealcast you as a prisoner who--through both good and bad luck--was freed from confinement, but marooned on an alien world. He goes on to become a sort of messiah figure to the four-armed natives, while other, scarier, natives want to kill him. It ends with a cliffhanger that this game does nothing to resolve. Now, you play as a new character who works for the Terran Colonial Authority. You're a space marshal on the ship Atlantis. You and your buxom partner, who looks more like an exotic dancer than a police woman, have to solve problems in a game only tenuously connected with the originalUnreal.Core gameplay and mission design are good, but uninspired. Legend has taken a conservative, almost minimalist approach. They've made a solid shooter that takes full advantage of Epic's state-of-the-art graphics engine, but did nothing to set the shooter apart from the crowd. One hopes thatUnreal II: The Awakeningawakens Epic to the fact thatUnrealis a genuinely interesting franchise that deserves more.--Andrew S.

Although much of the information in this book has been reported previously or revealed at trial, anyone looking for a comprehensive overview of the case will find it here. The authors chart not only the police investigation and trial but the personal and family history of Scott and Laci. A more balanced examination of the case is all that's missing to make this book really stand out. Up front, Crier states that since the first days of the case, she felt certain that Scott was a sociopath responsible for his wife's disappearance, and throughout the book, she demonstrates how and why. Given Scott's behavior in the weeks prior to and immediately after Laci's disappearance, not to mention all the lies he told to police, family and friends, she's not exactly going out on a limb. Although few people would doubt Scott's guilt, the whole book is very pro-police-it's even dedicated \"To all those who protect and serve.\" Had the authors started from a presumption of innocence and turned a critical eye on the investigation, which yielded more circumstantial than solid forensic evidence, the book would have been more compelling, but its thoroughness will draw many readers nonetheless. 12 pages of color photos.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0060838582": "On any given day, one out of four Americans opts for a quick and cheap meal at a fast-food restaurant, without giving either its speed or its thriftiness a second thought. Fast food is so ubiquitous that it now seems as American, and harmless, as apple pie. But the industry's drive for consolidation, homogenization, and speed has radically transformed America's diet, landscape, economy, and workforce, often in insidiously destructive ways. Eric Schlosser, an award-winning journalist, opens his ambitious and ultimately devastating expos&eacute; with an introduction to the iconoclasts and high school dropouts, such as Harlan Sanders and the McDonald brothers, who first applied the principles of a factory assembly line to a commercial kitchen. Quickly, however, he moves behind the counter with the overworked and underpaid teenage workers, onto the factory farms where the potatoes and beef are grown, and into the slaughterhouses run by giant meatpacking corporations. Schlosser wants you to know why those French fries taste so good (with a visit to the world's largest flavor company) and \"what really lurks between those sesame-seed buns.\" Eater beware: forget your concerns about cholesterol, there is--literally--feces in your meat.Schlosser's investigation reaches its frightening peak in the meatpacking plants as he reveals the almost complete lack of federal oversight of a seemingly lawless industry. His searing portrayal of the industry is disturbingly similar to Upton Sinclair'sThe Jungle, written in 1906: nightmare working conditions, union busting, and unsanitary practices that introduceE. coliand other pathogens into restaurants, public schools, and homes. Almost as disturbing is his description of how the industry \"both feeds and feeds off the young,\" insinuating itself into all aspects of children's lives, even the pages of their school books, while leaving them prone to obesity and disease. Fortunately, Schlosser offers some eminently practical remedies. \"Eating in the United States should no longer be a form of high-risk behavior,\" he writes. Where to begin?

Across the city's archdiocese, trusted priests have been accused of the worst possible betrayal of the souls in their care. InFaith, Jennifer Haigh explores the fallout for one devout family, the McGanns.Estranged for years from her difficult and demanding relatives, Sheila McGann has remained close to her older brother Art, the popular, dynamic pastor of a large suburban parish. When Art finds himself at the center of the maelstrom, Sheila returns to Boston, ready to fight for him and his reputation. What she discovers is more complicated than she imagined. Her strict, lace-curtain-Irish mother is living in a state of angry denial. Sheila's younger brother Mike, to her horror, has already convicted his brother in his heart. But most disturbing of all is Art himself, who persistently dodges Sheila's questions and refuses to defend himself.As the scandal forces long-buried secrets to surface,Faithexplores the corrosive consequences of one family's history of silence&mdash;and the resilience its members ultimately find in forgiveness. Throughout, Haigh demonstrates how the truth can shatter our deepest beliefs&mdash;and restore them. A gripping, suspenseful tale of one woman's quest for the truth,Faithis a haunting meditation on loyalty and family, doubt and belief. Elegantly crafted, sharply observed, this is Jennifer Haigh's most ambitious novel to date.A Q&amp;A with Author Jennifer HaighQ:What was your inspiration for writingFaith?Haigh:When I moved to Boston from Iowa in 2002, the city was reeling from revelations that Catholic priests had molested children, and that the Archdiocese had covered up the abuse. I was reeling too:  I was raised in a Catholic family, spent twelve years in parochial schools and had extremely fond memories of my interactions with Catholic clergy. It&rsquo;s no exaggeration to say that nuns and priests were the heroes of my childhood.  Like many people, I was horrified by what had happened in Boston--and, as later became clear, in Catholic dioceses across the country.Faithwas my attempt to explain the inexplicable, to understand what I couldn&rsquo;t make sense of in any other way.Q:Exploring the interplay between parents and children and among siblings is a delicate art that is not easily mastered, even for seasoned writers. How do you, as a storyteller, work to keep your story emotionally evocative&mdash;pulling the reader in with a depth of feeling&mdash;without falling into melodrama or treacle?Haigh:I don&rsquo;t try to make the reader feel any particular way. I just try to be accurate, to show people as they are.Q:Faithis told from the point of view of Art&rsquo;s sister, Sheila. It&rsquo;s a surprising choice, since she doesn&rsquo;t actually witness the events in question. Why did you approach the story in this way?Haigh:It took me a while to figure out how to tell this story.  When I read account of priests who&rsquo;d been accused of sexual abuse, I was struck by the difficulty of getting to the bottom of such cases. Often it comes down to one person&rsquo;s word against another:   only two people know for sure what happened, and sometimes the child is too traumatized to remember it clearly.  As Sheila tells the story, she&rsquo;s struggling to arrive at the truth, to find out whether her brother could possibly have done the things he&rsquo;s accused of, to imagine what he thought and felt, to get inside his head. In a sense, it mirrors the way all novels are written.  To me, writing is an exercise in empathy.Q:Over the course of four novels, you&rsquo;ve broadened your skills and honed your narrative dexterity, from the exquisite character sketches ofMrs. Kimble, to broader questions of family, religion, and society in the rich, multi-layered family drama that isFaith. What are you working on next?Haigh:My current project is a collection of short stories set in Bakerton, the Pennsylvania coal town where my second novel,Baker Towers, took place.Q:What inspires you as a writer&mdash;and as a reader?  Who has influenced your writing and who you are as a person?Haigh:Like all writers, I am a reader first. When my work is going well, I read. When it&rsquo;s going badly, I read more. Faulkner, William Styron, James Salter, Alice Munro, William Trevor, Richard Yates, JM Coetzee:  these are writers whose books remind me what&rsquo;s possible, why I wanted to write novels in the first place.",

        "0075536668": "The ostensible subject ofThe Sound and the Furyis the  dissolution of the  Compsons, one of those august old Mississippi families that fell on hard  times and wild eccentricity after the Civil War. But in fact what William Faulkner  is really after in his legendary novel is the kaleidoscope of consciousness--the overwrought mind caught in the act of thought. His rich, dark, scandal-ridden story of  squandered fortune, incest (in thought if not in deed), madness, congenital brain damage, theft, illegitimacy, and stoic endurance is told in the interior  voices of three Compson brothers: first Benjy, the \"idiot\" man-child who  blurs together three decades of inchoate sensations as he stalks the fringes  of the family's former pasture; next Quentin, torturing himself brilliantly, obsessively over Caddy's lost virginity and his own failure to recover the family's honor as he wanders around the seedy fringes of Boston; and finally Jason, heartless, shrewd, sneaking, nursing a perpetual sense of injury and outrage against his outrageous family.If Benjy's section is the most daringly experimental, Jason's is the most  harrowing. \"Once a bitch always a bitch, what I say,\" he begins, lacing into Caddy's illegitimate daughter, and then proceeds to hurl mud at blacks, Jews, his sacred Compson ancestors, his glamorous, promiscuous sister, his  doomed  brother Quentin, his ailing mother, and the long-suffering black servant Dilsey who holds the family together by sheer force of character.Notoriously \"difficult,\"The Sound and the Furyis actually one of  Faulkner's more accessible works once you get past the abrupt, unannounced  time shifts--and certainly the most powerful emotionally. Everything is  here: the complex equilibrium of pre-civil rights race relations; the  conflict between Yankee capitalism and Southern agrarian values; a meditation  on time, consciousness, and Western philosophy. And all of it is rendered in prose  so gorgeous it can take your breath away. Here, for instance, Quentin recalls an  autumnal encounter back home with the old black possum hunter Uncle Louis:And we'd sit in the dry leaves that whispered a little with the slow  respiration of our waiting and with the slow breathing of the earth and the windless October, the rank smell of the lantern fouling the brittle air,  listening to the dogs and to the echo of Louis' voice dying away.  He never raised it, yet on a still night we have heard it from our front porch.  When  he called the dogs in he sounded just like the horn he carried slung on his shoulder and never used, but clearer, mellower, as though his voice were a  part of darkness and silence, coiling out of it, coiling into it again.   WhoOoooo.  WhoOoooo.  WhoOooooooooooooooo.What Faulkner has created is a modernist epic in which characters assume  the stature of gods and the primal family events resonate like myths.

Fair and tall, Maya does not resemble her Chilean side, neither her absentee pilot father nor tough-love Berkeley activist Nidia, but, rather, her Danish flight-attendant mother, who left her newborn with her in-laws. To further complicate matters, Maya&#x2019;s guiding light was her grandfather, Nidia&#x2019;s second husband, a wise and loving African American astronomer. It is his death that precipitates the &#x201C;voyage to the underworld&#x201D; of addiction, crime, and homelessness that nearly kills her. Maya alternates between recounting her past and reporting on her gradual acclimation to Chilo&#xE9;, a microcosm of Chile&#x2019;s cultural and spiritual splendor and traumatic and tragic history. Every character is enthralling, including Manuel, the all-but-monastic anthropologist and political exile who takes Maya in; Freddy, the young junkie Maya meets in Las Vegas; and the &#x201C;good witches,&#x201D; who restore her sense of worth.

Although the book opens with a scary scene--a family is stabbed to death by \"a man named Jack&#x201D; --the story quickly moves into more child-friendly storytelling.

Quickly recognizing that the baby is orphaned, the graveyard's ghostly residents adopt  him, name him Nobody (\"Bod\"), and allow him to live in their tomb. Taking inspiration from Kipling&#x2019;sThe Jungle Book, Gaiman describes how the toddler navigates among the headstones, asking a lot of questions and picking up the tricks of the living and the dead. In serial-like episodes, the story follows Bod's progress as he grows from baby to teen, learning life&#x2019;s lessons amid a cadre of the long-dead, ghouls, witches, intermittent human interlopers.  A pallid, nocturnal guardian named Silas ensures that Bod receives food, books, and anything else he might need from the human world. Whenever the boy strays from his usual play among the headstones, he finds new dangers, learns his limitations and strengths, and acquires the skills he needs to survive within the confines of the graveyard and in wider world beyond.

        "0060855029": "In 1996, 26-year-old Peter Hessler arrived in Fuling, a town on China's Yangtze River, to begin a two-year Peace Corps stint as a teacher at the local college. Along with fellow teacher Adam Meier, the two are the first foreigners to be in this part of the Sichuan province for 50 years. Expecting a calm couple of years, Hessler at first does not realize the social, cultural, and personal implications of being thrust into a such radically different society. InRiver Town: Two Years on the Yangtze, Hessler tells of his experience with the citizens of Fuling, the political and historical climate, and the feel of the city itself.\"Few passengers disembark at Fuling ... and so Fuling appears like a break in a dream--the quiet river, the cabins full of travelers drifting off to sleep, the lights of the city rising from the blackness of the Yangtze,\" says Hessler. A poor city by Chinese standards, the students at the college are mainly from small villages and are considered very lucky to be continuing their education. As an English teacher, Hessler is delighted with his students' fresh reactions to classic literature. One student says of Hamlet, \"I don't admire him and I dislike him. I think he is too sensitive and conservative and selfish.\" Hessler marvels,You couldn't have said something like that at Oxford. You couldn't simply say: I don't like Hamlet because I think he's a lousy person. Everything had to be more clever than that ... you had to dismantle it ... not just the play itself but everything that had ever been written about it.Over the course of two years, Hessler and Meier learn more they ever guessed about the lives, dreams, and expectations of the Fuling people.Hessler's writing is lovely. His observations are evocative, insightful, and often poignant--and just as often, funny. It's a pleasure to read of his (mis)adventures. Hessler returned to the U.S. with a new perspective on modern China and its people. After readingRiver Town, you'll have one, too.--Dana Van Nest--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

Yet the kingdoms of men grew complacent in their victory--and slowly, the defeated orcish clans regrouped under the banner of a new visionary leader.Now a darker shadow has fallen over the world, threatening to extinguish all life--all hope. The drums of war play upon the winds once again--rising urgently toward the inevitable hour when the skies will rain fire--and the world will tremble before the coming of the Burning Legion.WarCraft IIIreturns players to the war-torn world of Azeroth.

        "0061132179": "Starred Review. Fortunately, despite its title and cover photo, this is not a kitschy book about a folksy language spoken by quaint, elderly Jews. It is, rather, an earthy romp through the lingua franca of Jews, which has roots reaching back to the Hebrew Bible and which continues to thrive in 21st-century America. Canadian professor, translator and performer Wex has an academic's breadth of knowledge, and while he doesn't ignore yourbubbe'stsimmes, he gives equal time to the semantic nuances ofputz, schmuck,shlongandshvants. Wex organizes his material around broad, idiosyncratic categories, but like the authors of the Talmud (the source for a large number of Yiddish idioms), he strays irrepressibly beyond the confines of any given topic. His lively wit roams freely, and Rabbi Akiva and Sholem Aleichem collide happily with Chaucer, Elvis and Robert Petrie. Academics, and others, will be disappointed at the lack of source notes, and a few errors have crept in (the fifth day of Sukkot is not Hoshana Rabba, for instance). Overall, however, this treasure trove of linguistics, sociology, history and folklore offers a fascinating look at how, through the centuries, a unique and enduring language has reflected an equally unique and enduring culture.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Indeed, it is impossible to understand the Civil War without getting to know the complex figure of the 16th president. More than any other biographer, Stephen B.

While necessary for advancing in levels, the battles occur with such frequency that they can grow annoying, making for a tedious game experience.The epic storyline spans four discs--over 40 hours of gameplay--and is based around a mercenary cadet who finds himself caught up with an underground rebel faction.

        "0091954053": "*Starred Review* What, ho?! This blighter Faulks, after making a reasonably good show of posing as Ian Fleming (Devil May Care, 2009), has the unmitigated gall to take a run at impersonating the inimitable P. G., the very incarnation of sui generis? Doesn&#x2019;t he know that Wodehouseans far and wide, well born and less so, will be sharpening their incisors for the chance to take a chomp at the hindquarters of the cheeky upstart? But wait. Hold off, old sports. Young Faulksie just may have the gray matter to make a go of it. The first order of business when attempting to offer homage to Sir Pelham Grenville is to construct a plot as screwball crazy as anything Shakespeare ever concocted in the Forest of Arden (disguises, mistaken identities, catastrophic kerfuffles all de rigueur); next is to plop bumbling aristocrat Bertie Wooster in the middle of the muddle; and, finally, of course, it&#x2019;s necessary to set Bertie&#x2019;s unflappable manservant, the all-knowing Jeeves, to the herculean task of making it all work. Faulksie&#x2019;s plot is spot on: Bertie&#x2019;s pal, Peregrine Woody Beeching, has been dumped by his beloved, but Bertie is on the case. The plan, for reasons only a savvy Hegelian could fathom, involves Bertie posing as a manservant and Jeeves as his master. Brilliant stroke, that, allowing Jeeves to show his stuff at dinner-table chitchat and Bertie to, well, spill the gravy. Naturally, it all takes place at a country house (Wodehouse&#x2019;s Forest of Arden), and, equally naturally, Miss Georgiana Meadowes, who makes Bertie&#x2019;s heart go pitty-pat, is also in attendance. OK, fine, this P. G. poseur gets the plot right, but what about the all-important patter, the Bertie-isms and the priceless Bertie-Jeeves dialogue duets? But Faulksie nails it again, evoking rather than imitating, but doing so in perfect pitch. Finally, old-timers will doubtless recoil in horror at the shocking conclusion, but let&#x2019;s all loosen our stuffed shirts and let the new guy have his way. Top drawer.

        "0099481685": "John Grisham turns a satirical eye on the overblown ritual of the festive holiday season, and the result isSkipping Christmas, a modest but funny novel about the tyranny of December 25. Grisham's story revolves around a typical middle-aged American couple, Luther and Nora Krank. On the first Sunday after Thanksgiving they wave their daughter Blair off to Peru to work for the Peace Corps, and they suddenly realize that \"for the first time in her young and sheltered life Blair would spend Christmas away from home.\"Luther Krank sees his daughter's Christmas absence as an opportunity. He estimates that \"a year earlier, the Luther Krank family had spent $6,100 on Christmas,\" and have \"precious little to show for it.\" So he makes an executive decision, telling his wife, friends, and neighbors that \"we won't do Christmas.\" Instead, Luther books a 10-day Caribbean cruise. But things start to turn nasty when horrified neighbors get wind of the Krank's subversive scheme and besiege the couple with questions about their decision.Grisham builds up a funny but increasingly terrifying picture of how this  tight-knit community turns on the Kranks, who find themselves under increasing pressure to conform. As the tension mounts, readers may wonder whether they will manage to board their plane on Christmas day.Skipping Christmasis Grisham-lite, with none of the serious action or drama of his legal thrillers, but a funny poke at the craziness of Christmas.--Jerry Brotton, Amazon.co.uk--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

I give it now to my children and grandchildren, and to yours, so they will always know what it was like in America when people were free.Since the publication of her bestselling memoir,Going Rogue, in 2009, former Alaska governor Sarah Palin has traveled the country extensively. She has visited cities and towns in almost every state, dropped in on military bases, given talks and speeches to small groups and at massive rallies. Throughout her travels, she has been privileged to meet thousands of Americans&mdash;ordinary men and women who have shared with her their hopes and dreams, their love of country, and their fears about what lies ahead.

I wanted to live inside its pages, where I could imagine not just the scenes themselves, but the cameras, the lights, the actors reading their lines off to the sides of the set. Main character Jude Keffy-Horn--named after a Beatles song by his adoptive hippy parents--spends his high school days in small town Vermont getting high with his best friend Teddy, waiting to turn 16, when he can legally drop out. When Teddy dies of an overdose on the last day of 1987, Jude is sent to live with his pot-dealer father in New York City. Jude soon falls in with a group of straight edge Hari Krishnas, where his commitment to abstinence in all forms--drugs, sex, meat--becomes an addiction itself. Jude struggles to create an identity amongst the extreme movements taking root downtown, while his parents struggle to understand their son&#x2019;s rejection of their free love culture. Author Eleanor Henderson's meticulous research into the straight edge movement in the late 1980s has opened a door to a piece of history handled with love, care, and incredibly unforgettable characters.  --Alexandra Foster",

Pragmatic Sam Vimes, Commander of Ankh-Morpork's City Watch, can't complain. He has a title, his wife is due to give birth to their first child any moment and he hasn't had to pound a beat in ages but that doesn't stop him from missing certain bits of his old life. Thank goodness there's work to be done. Vimes manages to corner a murderer, Carcer, on the library dome at Unseen University during a tremendous storm, only to be zapped back in time 30 years, to an Ankh-Morpork where the Watch is a joke, the ruling Patrician mad and the city on the verge of rebellion. Three decades earlier, a man named John Keel took over the Night Watch and taught young Sam Vimes how to be a good cop before dying in that rebellion. Unfortunately, in this version of the past, Carcer has killed Keel. The only way Vimes can hope to return home and ensure he has a future to return home to is to take on Keel's role. The author lightens Vimes's decidedly dark situation with glimpses into the origins of several of the more unique denizens of Ankh-Morpork. One comes away, as always, with the feeling that if Ankh-Morpork isn't a real place, it bloody well ought to be.Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

The good priest is frantic to know why Kevin Dennehy refused to the end to marry Enda, who lived as his wife for decades with none suspecting their sin. When pressed, Kevin would only say, &quot;there's some explanations that get you nowhere.&quot; That leaves it to Enda, an Irish Scheherazade, to breathlessly tell Father &quot;the all of it,&quot; a wild, eyebrow-raising tale that meanders like sheep on the narrow roads.

        "0060573775": "Kurt Vonnegut's absurdist classicSlaughterhouse-Fiveintroduces us to Billy Pilgrim, a man who becomes unstuck in time after he is abducted by aliens from the planet Tralfamadore. In a plot-scrambling display of virtuosity, we follow Pilgrim simultaneously through all phases of his life, concentrating on his (and Vonnegut's) shattering experience as an American prisoner of war who witnesses the firebombing of Dresden.Don't let the ease of reading fool you--Vonnegut's isn't a conventional, or simple, novel. He writes, &quot;There are almost no characters in this story, and almost no dramatic confrontations, because most of the people in it are so sick, and so much the listless playthings of enormous forces. One of the main effects of war, after all, is that people are discouraged from being characters...&quot;Slaughterhouse-Five(taken from the name of the building where the POWs were held) is not only Vonnegut's most powerful book, it is as important as any written since 1945. LikeCatch- 22, it fashions the author's experiences in the Second World War into an eloquent and deeply funny plea against butchery in the service of authority.Slaughterhouse-Fiveboasts the same  imagination, humanity, and gleeful appreciation of the absurd found in Vonnegut's other works, but the book's basis in rock-hard, tragic fact gives it a unique poignancy--and humor.--This text refers to theMass Market Paperbackedition.",

        "0061338818": "Multimillion-seller Coelho (The Devil and Miss Prym, etc.) returns with another uncanny fusion of philosophy, religious miracle and moral parable. The Portobello of the title is London's Portobello Road, where Sherine Khalil, aka Athena, finds the worship meeting she's leading&mdash;where she becomes an omniscient goddess named Hagia Sophia&mdash;disrupted by a Protestant protest. Framed as a set of interviews conducted with those who knew Athena, who is dead as the book opens, the story recounts her birth in Transylvania to a Gypsy mother, her adoption by wealthy Lebanese Christians; her short, early marriage to a man she meets at a London college (one of the interviewees); her son Viorel's birth; and her stint selling real estate in Dubai. Back in London in the book's second half, Athena learns to harness the powers that have been present but inchoate within her, and the story picks up as she acquires a \"teacher\" (Deidre O'Neill, aka Edda, another interviewee), then disciples (also interviewed), and speeds toward a spectacular end. Coelho veers between his signature criticism of modern life and the hydra-headed alternative that Athena taps into. Athena's earliest years don't end up having much plot, but the second half's intrigue sustains the book.(May)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Although the Arkham asylum is well fortified, he has a nagging feeling that all is not well, which proves to be the case when seconds after turning The Joker over to the guards, the master criminal breaks free of his captors. Even more surprising than this quick turn of events is the revelation that it was never The Joker's intent to escape the vault-like facility, but instead to trap Batman there. Surrounded by an asylum full of dangerous criminals, many of which he put there and all at the beck and call of the Joker, can Batman survive and discover what is behind the Joker's intricate plot?GameplayInBatman: Arkham Asylumplayers strap on the gadget-heavy utility belt of the Caped Crusader. Gameplay here is a combination of both the knuckle crunching rush of hand to hand combat as you take on the hordes of thugs that infest Arkham Asylum, and stealth gameplay in which you must dispatch individuals from the shadows. Players can expect an engrossing single player campaign in which Batman continually moves forward to face the henchmen, bosses and traps that The Joker has set for him. With regards to opponents, in addition to The Joker who you will hear more than you see, the dark walls of Arkham also hold familiar villains from the the Batman criminal universe including Harley Quinn, Victor Zsasz and Killer Croc, that you will have to deal with, but don't expect a one-dimensional experience. As players progress from environment to environment within Arkham they will have to use varying combinations of muscle, detective skills, gadgetry and a certain degree of light RPG-like leveling of Batman's skills, arsenal and physical characteristics to survive and discover what The Joker's underlying scheme is.In addition to the story-driven single player campaignArkham Asylumalso contains various additional play modes. These include an arcade styled combat mode where players accumulate points by engaging hordes of thugs in a hand to hand slugfest across a series of maps, in which Batman's physical strength and agility play a major role. The key here is to chain together as many attacks as possible due to the fact that with each successful combo players increase the point multiplier associated with their actions. The game also features a time-based stealth mode where players must hone their ability to strike silently from the shadows. This gameplay, referred to as 'Invisible Predator' utilizes the Dark Knight's skill with gadgets like the grapple tool, batarang and explosives. These allow for vertical/horizontal mobility, the ability to quickly strike from above and at a distance and to take out enemies and create distractions, even through walls. But remember that Batman works solo and is not superhuman. Your enemies will congregate around trouble areas and work as a team against you, so you must be silent, plan your attacks wisely, strike quickly and discover the value of encouraging fear within enemies.Key FeaturesExperience the game in a whole new way with Game of the Year Edition extras including: Access to the playable Joker character (in the PS3 version only) and the Joker Challenge maps and 4 additional standard challenge maps.Utilize the unique FreeFlow combat system to chain together unlimited combos seamlessly and battle with huge groups of The Joker's henchmen in brutal melee brawls.Investigate as Batman, the world's greatest detective, by solving intricate puzzles with the help of cutting edge forensic tools including x-ray scanning, fingerprint scans, 'Amido Black' spray and a pheromone tracker.Face off against Gotham's greatest villains including The Joker, Harley Quinn, Victor Zsasz and Killer Croc.Become the Invisible Predator with Batman's fear takedowns and unique vantage point system to move without being seen and hunt enemies.Choose multiple takedown methods, including swooping from the sky and smashing through walls, and use the predator camera get a closer look at the action.Explore every inch of Arkham Asylum and roam freely on the infamous island, presented for the first time ever in its gritty and realistic entirety.Experience what it's like to be Batman using batarangs, explosive gel aerosol, the Batclaw, sonar resonator and the line launcher.Unlock more secrets by completing hidden challenges in the world and develop and customize equipment by earning experience points.Enjoy complete superhero freedom in the environment with the use of Batman's grapple to get to any place you can see, jump from any height and glide in any direction.",
        "0062110837": "An Amazon Best Book of the Month, April 2013: Imaginative and meticulously researched, this enchanting debut novel from Helene Wecker is, in reality, an historical fiction. Set primarily in turn-of-the-century Manhattan, it deliberately details the immigrant experience--the wonders and hardships of being in a new country and the discoveries, triumphs, and failures that follow--while bringing the city itself to life with such passion that New York of yore seems like a magical land. Beyond reality, however,The Golem and the Jinni, as the title implies, is also a fantastic work of fantasy. The Golem is an insatiably curious clay \"woman\" that was created to seem human while serving only her husband; the Jinni is a magical \"man\" whose fascination with mortals has left him nearly stripped of his own nature and forced to live as one. These mythical characters from otherwise clashing cultures not only coexist, but come to rely upon one another in order to exist at all. In turn, their story finds us not only rooting for them to find peace and happiness, but gaining a better understanding of our own human nature in the process.--Robin A. Rothman",
        "0062069934": "Margolin kicks off his latest thriller with a bit of literary legerdemain. He introduces Charles Benedict, a strikingly handsome and charismatic defense attorney and amateur magician who appears to be the novel's leading man. But Benedict is swiftly exposed as an extremely effective homicidal sociopath, and the book shifts to its true protagonist, private sleuth Dana Cutler, who is quickly dispatched on a convoluted cross-country search for a bejeweled golden scepter with a history curiously similar to that of Sam Spade's famous Maltese Falcon. It's a given that this quest will eventually bring the shrewd detective in contact with the homicidal Benedict. Jonathan Davis's narration is smooth and well paced. He adds just the right amount of smarm and smirk to Benedict's speech and captures all of Dana's drive, determination, and fearlessness. The book's other characters have more than their share of accents&mdash;from the mysterious Frenchwoman who sends Dana after the scepter to a surprisingly cheery Russian mob boss.

        "0061020397": "Carpe Jugulumis the 23rd Discworld novel, and with it this durable series continues its juggernaut procession onward. Pratchett is an author who inspires such devotions that his fans will fall on the novel with cries of joy. Nonfans, perhaps, will want to know what all the fuss is about; and that's something difficult to put into a few words. The best thing to do for those completely new to Pratchett is to sample him for themselves, and this novel is as good a place to start as any. But fans have a more precise question. They know that Discworld novels come in one of two varieties: the quite good and the brilliant. So, for instance, whereHogfatherandMaskeradewere quite good,Feet of ClayandJingowere brilliant. While true fans wouldn't want to do without the former, they absolutely live for the latter. And withCarpe Jugulum, Pratchett has hit the jackpot again. This novel is one of the brilliant ones.The plot is a version of an earlier Discworld novel,Lords and Ladies, with the predatory elves of that novel being replaced here by suave and deadly vampires, and the tiny kingdom of Lancre being defended by its witches. But plot is the least of Pratchett's appeal, andCarpe Jugulumis loaded with marvelous characters (not least the witches themselves, about whom we learn a deal more), comic touches and scenes of genius, and even some of the renowned down-to-earth Pratchett wisdom (about the inner ethical conflicts we all face and the wrongness of treating people as things). Pratchett's vampires are elegant Bela Lugosi types, and they come up against an unlikely but engaging alliance of witches; blue-skinned pixies like Rob Roy Smurfs; a doubting priest with a boil on his face; and a magical house-size Phoenix in a seamless, completely absorbing, and feel-good-about-the-universe mixture.

        "B0000696CZ": "How big is this game? Even publicists forother gamesend up talking aboutVice Citywhen they call our office, babbling in the same helplessly intoxicated way that afflicts everyone who plays it. The achievement ofVice City(which, as everyone knows by now, is set in the 1980s and offers an all-new,Miami Vice-inspired story) is not only that it manages to live up to an absurd level of expectation, but that it takes the game places that fans of its predecessorGrand Theft Auto 3never dreamed of, and that it achieves this astonishing level of innovation without losing anything that madeGTA3the bestselling PS2 game of all time.After a brilliant homage to the era of the Commodore 64 in the opening credits, the first thing you'll notice is the improved graphics, which are smoother and more detailed, and--with effects like neon lights reflected on rain-slick streets, and intense Florida sunlight--have a lush, tropical look that immediately gives you a strong sense of place. The architecture is more fabulous by tenfold, with art deco buildings, high-rise hotels, and believably seedy back alleys. The control scheme is essentially the same as inGTA3, but the cars handle much better, and in pedestrian mode there is a new crouch move. You will have access to fast, great-handling cars right away, as opposed toGTA3which made you unlock the second island before you could get your hands on any respectable wheels. This game has such riches to offer that there is no need to be chintzy with the vehicles.Cops are more vigilant this time--minor offenses like whacking innocent bystanders will more often than not get you a two-star wanted level--and are harder to elude (though they still can't seem to climb stairs or negotiate sharp turns). So while free-roaming exploration is as fun as ever, there is more incentive to perform the missions instead of randomly raising hell. Not that that's a bad thing: even lazy criminals like myself (inGTA3, I would rather toss hand grenades into traffic than follow orders from some rude Mafia boss) will be quickly caught up in the vivid characters and hilarious, fascinating story, in which you play an acid-washed-jeans-wearing thug named Tommy Vercetti. Where inGTA3missions were blocky, schematic affairs only nominally connected to the story, this time tasks move the story briskly along and deftly blend cinematics and game action. For example, there is a scene of a character throwing Tommy a gun, at which point you are suddenly thrown back into the action and must make an instant decision about whom to trust and what to do.There are more, and more detailed, indoor environments, including a hotel, police station, and mall (a slight downside to this is that some of the more elaborate indoor environments require load times). The layout of the city, with tons of backyards, narrow alleys, and fire escapes, encourages creativity when eluding pursuit, as does greater access to rooftops. Get your motorcycle up the fire escape and a whole new world of action is possible, including... well, use your imagination.This overview barely scratches the surface of theVice Cityexperience, its colorful explosion of music, clothes, combat, and brilliant voice acting, not to mention the plot twist midway through the game that changes the very nature of the game itself. Though it was the outrageous, amoral violence that got all the press, the essential genius ofGTA3was its intoxicating blend of script and open-ended action. InVice Citythis is--to use a clich&#xE9; that is for once apropos--taken to a whole new level.--David StoeszPros:Astonishing, innovative gameplayGodlike attention to detailOpportunity to drive on the beach at midnight listening to the Human League's \"Fascination\"Con:More load times",
        "B00005QEFF": "Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house.

        "0060800216": "The World's Religions, by Huston Smith, has been a standard introduction to its eponymous subject since its first publication in 1958. Smith writes humbly, forswearing judgment on the validity of world religions. His introduction asks, &quot;How does it all sound from above? Like bedlam, or do the strains blend in strange, ethereal harmony? ... We cannot know. All we can do is try to listen carefully and with full attention to each voice in turn as it addresses the divine. Such listening defines the purpose of this book.&quot; His criteria for inclusion and analysis of religions in this book are &quot;relevance to the modern mind&quot; and &quot;universality,&quot; and his interest in each religion is more concerned with its principles than its context. Therefore, he avoids cataloging the horrors and crimes of which religions have been accused, and he attempts to show each &quot;at their best.&quot; YetThe World's Religionsis no pollyannaish romp: &quot;It is about religion alive,&quot; Huston writes. &quot;It calls the soul to the highest adventure it can undertake, a proposed journey across the jungles, peaks, and deserts of the human spirit. The call is to confront reality.&quot; And by translating the voices of Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Confucianism, Christianity, and Judaism, among others, Smith has amplified the divine call for generations of readers.--Michael Joseph Gross--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

        "0006551807": "Any talk ofThe Namesake--Jhumpa Lahiri's follow-up to her Pulitzer Prize-winning debut,Interpreter of Maladies--must begin with a name: Gogol Ganguli. Born to an Indian academic and his wife, Gogol is afflicted from birth with a name that is neither Indian nor American nor even really a first name at all. He is given the name by his father who, before he came to America to study at MIT, was almost killed in a train wreck in India. Rescuers caught sight of the volume of Nikolai Gogol's short stories that he held, and hauled him from the train. Ashoke gives his American-born son the name as a kind of placeholder, and the awkward thing sticks.Awkwardness is Gogol's birthright. He grows up a bright American boy, goes to Yale, has pretty girlfriends, becomes a successful architect, but like many second-generation immigrants, he can never quite find his place in the world. There's a lovely section where he dates a wealthy, cultured young Manhattan woman who lives with her charming parents. They fold Gogol into their easy, elegant life, but even here he can find no peace and he breaks off the relationship.  His mother finally sets him up on a blind date with the daughter of a Bengali friend, and Gogol thinks he has found his match. Moushumi, like Gogol, is at odds with the Indian-American world she inhabits. She has found, however, a circuitous escape: \"At Brown, her rebellion had been academic ... she'd pursued a double major in French. Immersing herself in a third language, a third culture, had been her refuge--she approached French, unlike things American or Indian, without guilt, or misgiving, or expectation of any kind.\" Lahiri documents these quiet rebellions and random longings with great sensitivity. There's no  cleverness or showing-off inThe Namesake, just beautifully confident storytelling. Gogol's story is neither comedy nor tragedy; it's simply that ordinary, hard-to-get-down-on-paper commodity: real life.--Claire Dederer--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

Collins and his team of researchers began their quest by sorting through a list of 1,435 companies, looking for those that made substantial improvements in their performance over time. They finally settled on 11--including Fannie Mae, Gillette, Walgreens, and Wells Fargo--and discovered common traits that challenged many of the conventional notions of corporate success. Making the transition from good to great doesn't require a high-profile CEO, the latest technology, innovative change management, or even a fine-tuned business strategy. At the heart of those rare and truly great companies was a corporate culture that rigorously found and promoted disciplined people to think and act in a disciplined manner. Peppered with dozens of stories and examples from the great and not so great, the book offers a well-reasoned road map to excellence that any organization would do well to consider.

        "0062200577": "*Starred Review* In Heart-Shaped Box (2007) and Horns (2010), Hill showed hints of an enlarging literary toolbox. With this 700-page opus, the tool set is complete, and Hill has indeed built something very big. The story follows Vic, from 8-year-old girl to troubled teen to embattled mother, as she struggles to survive as a &#x201C;strong creative&#x201D;&#x2014;one who has access (in her case, via a ramshackle bridge) to an alternate universe constructed from imagination. Problem is, a chief attraction of this other America is Christmasland, a snowy Neverland carnival controlled by cheery, ageless child-abductor Charlie Manx (think Bentley Little&#x2019;s Mailman or Stephen King&#x2019;s Pennywise). Manx tries to take Vic to Christmasland as a kid, and years later, in the book&#x2019;s central conflict, he tries to take her son. Hill doesn&#x2019;t spend much time in reality before careening deliriously off into a la-la land of horrifying absurdism (a bottomless Scrabble bag, a mouth full of fish-hook teeth). This engenders inelegance; at times, the parts are more than the whole. But Hill is omnivorous in his appetite for story and character, and here he has created his best: Lou, Vic&#x2019;s obese, warm-hearted lover; Bing, Manx&#x2019;s demented chief elf; and gutsy, heartbreaking Vic. Occasional drawings by Hill&#x2019;s Locke &amp; Key conspirator, Gabriel Rodriguez, add one more element to this vast and gangly but undeniably readable work.

        "0060091290": "Starred Review.Deftly evoking not only the romantic tension between hero and heroine but also the conflicts and challenges of the Victorian era, this superb romance from Kleypas launches her new series centered on the Wallflowers, four young ladies who are sick of being snubbed and overlooked by London's bachelors and who have banded together to find themselves husbands. Beautiful Annabelle Peyton represents Old World aristocracy; she's genteel but impoverished and desperately trying to maintain the appearance of wealth. Commoner Simon Hunt, on the other hand, is a brash, ambitious entrepreneur who has made a fortune investing in industry and railroads and is only marginally accepted by society. As Annabelle attempts to trap a moneyed aristocrat into marriage&mdash;with the help of her vivacious fellow Wallflowers, of course&mdash;Simon boldly pursues her, first with the desire to make her his mistress and then with far more noble intentions. The scenes involving Annabelle and the three other Wallflowers&mdash;two impudent American girls and a shy, stuttering English heiress&mdash;are almost as enjoyable as the ones in which Annabelle and Simon try to outmaneuver each other. The protagonists inevitably wind up at the altar, but their story doesn't end there. Kleypas delves deeper, touching on Annabelle's changing mindset (specifically, her growing admiration of Simon's working-class roots and her acceptance of everything he stands for) and Simon's insecurity over taking her away from polite society. By turns amusing, sensual and sober, but always compelling, this is a first-rate offering from a truly talented storyteller.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0060987464": "One doesn't usually think of rock stars as insightful, but, against all odds, glam-trash superstar Marilyn Manson has written a book that is actually an intelligent look at growing up. This autobiographical bildungsroman brings out the creepiest aspects of childhood, conveying the terror and fascination that young Marilyn (then called Brian) felt when looking through his grandfather's pornography, getting his first French kiss, and being taunted by the girls he wanted to \"date.\" Manson has the benefit of having grown up as an outcast and loser and then having become a star without forgetting what he went through. This gives him an incredibly broad perspective, which he brings to bear on his ordinary life in order to convey the more potent and frightening moments that shaped him into the pale-skinned weirdo that the Christian Right loves to hate.  Best of all, Manson is shockingly honest, and portrays himself as occasionally stupid, self-centered, over-sensitive, ignoble, and, mostly, highly fallible and human. It's a long way from the auto-hagiographies that other stars have written, and it's easily one of the best reads in celebrity bio.--James DiGiovanna--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

Ruth feels a coldness from her mother; Dana is unsettled by her kooky parents constantly uprooting her and her brother Ray. Regardless, the Planks pay a yearly visit to the Dickersons no matter where they've ended up living. As the girls come of age, Ruth takes an interest in art, sex, and Dana's brother, Ray, with whom she later reunites, at Woodstock, in a swirl of drugs and mud. Meanwhile, Dana realizes that her desires are directed toward women and sets off to pursue agricultural studies at a university, where she meets Clarice, an assistant professor. As time goes by, the floundering Plank Farm is in danger of being seized by Ruth's former boyfriend, a man who has had his eye on the land for years.

        "B0002B90SA": "Smug Statement: The Sith Lords is smart, deep, dark, and stands as the best thing to happen to Star Wars since Timothy Zahn penned the extraordinary Heir to the Empire trilogy. Much like a Padawan learning the ways of the Force from a Jedi Master, Obsidian Entertainment has embraced the teachings of BioWare, built upon the original formula, and forged a powerful sequel that will take your breath away faster than Vader ever&#xA0;could.In the five years that have passed since the fall of Lord Malak, the Dark Side of the Force has spread across the galaxy like a disease. Sith Lord attacks have devastated the Old Republic, and the Jedi guardians are on the verge of extinction. The Republic's only hope of survival lies within your uncertain hands. Awakening in a battle-damaged vessel that is spinning uncontrollably through an asteroid field, you have no recollection of your past, yet you can feel the Force flowing through your veins. Will you side with the Republic and battle the Sith scourge? Or will you fade into darkness and let evil reign?This compelling introduction pulls you into the plot, keeping you completely transfixed as you tip the scales between the light and dark and scour the cosmos for clues that will unearth your enigmatic past. The tale is paced to perfection and never once feels like it is making unnecessary detours to lengthen the experience.From HK-47's amusing \"droid prejudice\" banter to Kreia's cryptic messages, the game is overflowing with fascinating personalities and some of the most believable characters to ever be brought to life in a game. Again, pacing is used expertly to develop relationships with the player. As the plot unfolds, you'll be forced to decide who to trust, who to keep close, and who to keep a watchful eye on. When you communicate with your allies, your choice of words will affect your standing with them. If you have a high enough influence over them, they may open up to you and follow your ways (be it light or&#xA0;dark).The game also dives deeper into Star Wars lore as it utilizes a much wider selection of alien species, weapons, and gear, as well as planets that we really haven't seen much of in the movies or games. Obsidian can also be commended for creating not one, but two of the most fearsome and awe-inspiring nemeses in the Star Wars universe. Discovering who these Sith Lords are is another of the games exciting mysteries.On the gameplay front, Obsidian stuck to the formula of the original game, but has built upon it with little additions and subtle tweaks. Of course, this still means that your supporting party will blindly run over a clearly visible mine, load times are just as extensive, some of the loose ends in the plot are not tied up (what's up with the HK droids?), and slowdown occurs when too many characters engage in battle. In short it still has its annoyances, yet the new material more than makes up for them. As you engage in conversation, you can now tap into your skills to add a new level of persuasion. For instance, if your character is knowledgeable to the subject matter, you may be prompted with an awareness option. Another interesting addition is the ability to break down items into components that you can turn around and use to create a wide variety of things.The missions that you'll undertake are just as varied, and the consequences to your actions can be just as cataclysmic. A raised level cap won't stunt your characters growth this time around, and the variety that stems from the new character interactions only heightens the reasons to play this game numerous times. Many of the visuals are a bit underwhelming, but the detail in the facial modeling is much more defined, and you won't see as many unintentional identical twins throughout your&#xA0;journey.It's almost impossible to deny the charms that emerge from this title's expertly crafted story and unbound freedom. The Sith Lords is a crowning accomplishment for video games and one of the finest Star Wars stories ever told.Concept:A Star Wars mystery set in the old times that offers up a fantastic story and role-playing blissGraphics:Better facial models, but the environments are still bland and slowdown does occurSound:The score fits perfectly into Star Wars canon, and the character dialogue is some of the best to datePlayability:The same engine with a few enhancements around the edges. Influencing characters and making items are done wellEntertainment:You absolutely have to play it twice to see where the story goes for light and darkReplay:HighRated:9.25 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:February 20052nd Opinion:The call of The Sith Lords is impossible to resist. Embracing the dark side, I twisted an apprentice to my corrupt will, polluted the Force with senseless slaughter, and was told by my loyal HK unit that I was like \"a delightful random cruelty generator.\" Even more than its predecessor, The Sith Lords provides countless opportunities for players to revel in the aftermath of their own choices. Essentially, anyone who said that Obsidian couldn't live up to the standards set by BioWare's first installment should be stuffing their mouths full of Bantha fodder right about now. Every exemplary aspect of KOTOR has actually been improved through expanded dialogue options, tons of alignment-specific variables, and a more engaging story. Honestly, I want to give this game an even higher score, but I just can't ignore the multitude of technical problems (like pathfinding and battle glitches) and certain key plot point omissions. Regardless, despite the imperfections, The Sith Lords crushes the feeble windpipes of any other RPG of 2004.Rated:9 out of 10Editor:Joe JubaSubscribe to Game Informer",

No one from Arclight has survived an encounter with the Fade, except one teenage girl: Marina. Marina has no memory of her life before Arclight, and she is filled with guilt over the people who died attempting to rescue her, particularly the father of an enigmatic young man, Tobin. After it becomes clear that Marina has a strong but inexplicable connection to the Fade, she and Tobin enter dangerous dark territory to discover the truth. Told in the present tense, the episodic story relies on occasionally contrived dialogue to fill in past events that Marina cannot remember, and readers may grow frustrated as they must wait, along with Marina, to gradually understand how events connect.

        "B00012BSJ4": "When people ask me what my favorite game of all time is, I always answer the same thing:Metroid. Sure,Super Metroidon SNES took the concept and made it better, andMetroid Fusionwas a fantastic follow-up on the Game Boy Advance, but when push comes to shove the original is where my vote will always go. Then there'sMetroid Prime&#8230;but that's 3D and a story for a different day. This game and this story are all about the glory of 2D gaming.So you can only begin to imagine my excitement when Nintendo's newestMetroidredo appeared on my desk. For those of you that may not know,Zero Missionis a special edition of sorts. It's the originalMetroidwith spruced-up graphics, streamlined level designs and gameplay, plus a whole new chapter.At it's core, it is most definitely the originalMetroid, but as you travel around the world you start to notice differences. Hallways are changed, statues lead you to the next objective, and abilities like Power Grip and Space Jump that never existed in the original iteration pop up in time.Nintendo has been very hush-hush about this title since its announcement, and after playing through the game myself, I must admit I'm a little reluctant to give away too much, but I can give you some interesting facts to whet your whistle. The biggest chunk of new content takes place after you beat Mother Brain (which was where the original ended). Not only is this new zone fairly large (I would say it's bigger than Norfair and Brinstar combined) it incorporates a number of story elements that help tie the whole series together (includingMetroid Prime).In total, the game is still rather short. I beat it in roughly six and a half hours, and I wandered around a lot. But the new content is spectacular, and fans of the series will absolutely adore this special edition. And if you have never experiencedMetroid, then you are in for a treat. My one rip on this title is the fact that the game now holds your hand a little too much, so the title loses some of the wonder and puzzle solving that I loved about the original. But don't let this one setback stop you from picking up one of the greatest titles in the history of gaming.Concept:Update a classic with new graphics and lots of bonus materialGraphics:Crisp 2D sprites jump off your SP or GBA PlayerSound:Fantastic from beginning to endPlayability:Metroid's control set-up is still one of the most simple, yet complex schemes ever created &#8211; brilliantEntertainment:Replaying the original with added content is an 8-bit gamers dream come trueReplay:ModerateRated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Andy McNamaraIssue:February 20042nd Opinion:Much like the extended editions of The Lord of the Rings movies, Nintendo has reworked the originalMetroidto feature bonus content that ties into Samus' continuing adventures. I can't even begin to tell you how amazing this new material is. Let's just say that you're in for a big surprise after the Mother Brain fight. A huge surprise! I don't want to ruin the game for you, but I will say that there's a stretch of the game that I played with my jaw on the floor. Better yet, all of the original content has been extensively overhauled. The shape of the terrain has been altered dramatically, and as you progress through this incredible adventure you'll spot subtle changes every step of the way. With the original NES game included as a bonus, you'll get the chance to compare and contrast. Nintendo took one of the best games of all time and made it better. Buy it immediately.Rated:9.75 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review",
        "0062240501": "*Starred Review* Robinson&#x2019;s long-running and best-selling Inspector Banks series, now spanning more than 20 novels, has won a clutch of awards, including France&#x2019;s Grand Prix de Litt&#xE9;rature Polici&#xE8;re and Sweden&#x2019;s Martin Beck awards, along with nominations for Edgar and Agatha awards. Detective Chief Inspector Banks, the artsy and melancholic Yorkshire detective, and his snarky sidekick, Detective Inspector Annie Cabbot, are consistently fun to watch, whether you just drop in on this series or have seen the shifts in their relationship from the beginning. Robinson writes police procedurals in which the latest forensic science enhances, while still taking a back seat to, the basic arts of detection; Banks is clearly on the side of old-fashioned discovery of motive and opportunity, and his questioning of suspects is wonderful to witness. This time the body of a former university lecturer is found on the tracks of an abandoned railroad track in North Yorkshire. The man has been living hand to mouth since his dismissal on charges of sexual misconduct several years before. The scene reads as a suicide, except to Banks, who suspects that the 5,000 pounds left in the man&#x2019;s pocket and his recent reaching out to militant college contacts from the 1970s may point to a more complicated story. As usual with a Banks novel, the chief inspector&#x2019;s frictions with higher-ups are nearly as gripping as the unraveling of the case itself. First-rate procedural and character study.      HIGH-DEMAND BACKSTORY: An A-list staple, Robinson&#x2019;s Inspector Banks series has a devoted following, especially in libraries, and this is one of the series&#x2019; highlights. --Connie Fletcher",

        "0062129902": "Gr 4-8-\"In the Urwald you grow up fast or not at all,\" readers learn in the opening of this rich and fecund fantasy. Jinx is that staple of children's literature: the scorned, ill-used orphan who proves to be so much more gifted and important than he ever imagined possible. He occupies a world that is simultaneously original and familiar, influenced by centuries of folklore, but newly envisioned and vividly created. This eldritch, primeval forest that Jinx has been warned to shun is, nevertheless, where he has been abandoned by his heartless stepfather. Blackwood has populated this magical place with convincingly conflicted wizards and witches who seem uncertain as to how much they should be using their skills to control events or the beings around them. Jinx is slow to recognize his own powers as he digs his bare toes into the earth of the forest and feels the pulsing heartbeat of its life, or finds that he can call up fire. He is even slower to divine the motives of the various people he encounters, including Elwyn and Reven-youths under mysterious curses of their own-who navigate the Urwald beside him. Readers will thrill to the journey with Jinx as he discovers and grows into himself. Though they will not feel abandoned at the edge of a cliff at the book's end, they won't be surprised-and will be delighted-if sequels are in the offing.-Miriam Lang Budin, Chappaqua Library, NY&#x3B1;(c) Copyright 2011.

Now he's unemployed and is finally  starting to enjoy his new role as stay-at-home dad. All would be domestic bliss  if it were not for Jack's suspicions that his wife, who's been behaving  strangely and working long hours at the top-secret research labs of Xymos  Technology, is having an affair. When he's called in to help with her hush-hush  project, it seems like the perfect opportunity to see what his wife's been  doing, but Jack quickly finds there's a lot more going on in the lab than an  illicit affair. Within hours of his arrival at the remote testing center, Jack  discovers his wife's firm has created self-replicating nanotechnology--a literal  swarm of microscopic machines. Originally meant to serve as a military eye in  the sky, the swarm has now escaped into the environment and is seemingly intent  on killing the scientists trapped in the facility. The reader realizes early,  however, that Jack, his wife, and fellow scientists have more to fear from the  hidden dangers within the lab than from the predators without.The monsters may be smaller in this book, but Crichton's skill for suspense has  grown, makingPreya scary read that's hard to set aside, though not  without its minor flaws. The science in this novel requires more explanation  than did the cloning of dinosaurs, leading to lengthy and sometimes dry academic  lessons. And while the coincidence of Xymos's new technology running on the same  program Jack created at his previous job keeps the plot moving, it may be more  than some readers can swallow. But, thanks in part to a sobering foreword in  which Crichton warns of the real dangers of technology that continues to evolve  more quickly than common sense,Preysucceeds in gripping readers with a  tense and frightening tale of scientific suspense.--Benjamin Reese--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

Now his people are dying out and the evil mages of Eld are rising again. When Rain hears the call of his lost soul mate, Ellysetta, he journeys to the neighboring kingdom to find her; when he claims a woodcarver's daughter as his mate, he scandalizes the nobility of her country and rouses the interest of Eld's wicked wizards, who come seeking her in order to get at Rain. The first book in a series, much of this volume is devoted to establishing the characters and their world, at the expense of plot. Though the extended courtship between Rain and Ellysetta can grow tedious, the story moves well enough to hold readers' interest and draw them into the sequel (due in November), which should advance the plot significantly. A promising start, this series should have great appeal for fans of fantasy and will likely reward romance readers for whom patience is not a problem.(Oct.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Readers who require strict realism may be turned off by the touch of the paranormal, but Barbieri does such a wonderful job setting up the beauty and mystery of the island and its rich Gaelic roots that it is not a stretch to ask the reader to imagine that the place is also magical. A wonderful, subtle, transporting story. For readers who enjoyed Sarah Addison Allen&#x2019;s Garden Spells (2007) and Brunonia Barry&#x2019;s The Lace Reader (2008). --Susan Maguire",
        "0060899689": "There are a few books that belong on the shelf of every Civil War buff: James M. McPherson'sBattle Cry of Freedom, one of the better Abraham Lincoln biographies, something on Robert E. Lee, perhaps Shelby Foote's massive trilogyThe Civil War. Add Jay Winik's wonderfulApril 1865to the list. This is one of those rare, shining books that takes a new look at an old subject and changes the way we think about it. Winik shows that there was nothing inevitable about the end of the Civil War, from the fall of Richmond to the surrender at Appomattox to the murder of Lincoln. It all happened so quickly, in what \"proved to be perhaps the most moving and decisive month not simply of the Civil War, but indeed, quite likely, in the life of the United States.\"Things might have been rather different, too. \"What emerges from the panorama of April 1865 is that the whole of our national history could have been altered but for a few decisions, a quirk of fate, a sudden shift in luck.\" When Lee abandoned Richmond, for instance, his soldiers rendezvoused at a nearby town called Amelia Court House. There, the general expected to find boxcars full of food for his hungry troops. But \"a mere administrative mix-up\" left his army empty-handed and may have limited Lee's options in the days to come. Or what if Lee had decided not to surrender at all, but to turn his resourceful army into an outfit of guerrilla fighters who would harass federal officials? National reconciliation might have become impossible as the whole South turned into a region plagued with violence and terrorism. For the Union, \"there would be no real rest, no real respite, no true amity, nor, for that matter, any real sense of victory--only an amorphous state of neither war nor peace, raging like a low-level fever.\" One of Lee's officers actually proposed this scenario to his commander in those final hours; America is fortunate Lee didn't choose this path.Winik is an exceptionally good storyteller.April 1865is full of memorable images and you-are-there writing. Readers will come away with a new appreciation for that momentous month and a sharpened understanding of why and how the Civil War was fought. Let it be said plainly:April 1865is a magnificent work, surely the best book on the Civil War to be published in some time.--John J.

        "0060585439": "When kings marry foreign strangers for dynastic or financial reasons and queens are trained in piety over sensuality, royal mistresses seem an inevitability. Kings had flings and extramarital relationships through much of European history, and in her first book, Herman offers, with relish and dry wit, a delightful overview of their sexual escapades. Her subjects are international, though France dominates and England gets a strong showing. It's a lively account, organized by topic e.g., \"The Fruits of Sin&mdash;Royal Bastards.\" Herman weaves into a larger pattern the tales of recurrent figures, such as Louis XIV's mistress Ath&eacute;na&iuml;s de Montespan and Madame de Pompadour, who is perhaps more famous than her royal lover, Louis XV. Fashions, love potions and cheerful conversation kept kings enthralled while mistresses made themselves wealthy, husbands acquiesced or simmered, courtiers wooed the mistresses and the public admired or ridiculed. A striking number of these relationships continued despite arguments and even the lack of sex. George II even felt it necessary to keep a mistress for his reputation despite actually loving his wife. Herman ends on a modern note, recounting how Camilla Parker-Bowles famously introduced herself to Prince Charles by noting that her great-grandmother had been his great-great-grandfather's mistress. Herman ends on a serious note, but her wit and perceptiveness will carry readers through this royally pleasurable romp.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0062106392": "Sometime after dark on March 27, 2010, Arizona rancher Robert Krentz was found dead next to his four-wheeler on the grounds of his ranch on the Arizona-Mexico border. Krentz and his dog, Blue, had been missing since that morning. They were last heard from when he radioed his brother to say that he&#8217;d found an illegal alien on the property and was going to offer him assistance. The man Krentz encountered that day shot and killed him and his dog, without warning, before escaping to Mexico.It&#8217;s difficult to overstate the impact of Krentz&#8217;s death, which turned the issue of Arizona&#8217;s unsecured border&#8212;a crisis that the federal government had repeatedly ignored&#8212;into a national concern. As Arizona sheriff Larry Dever said in his testimony before the Senate Homeland Security Committee, &#8220;We cannot sit by while our citizens are terrorized, robbed, and murdered by ruthless and desperate people who enter our country illegally.&#8221; This momentum helped pass SB 1070, a bill that authorizes local law enforcement under certain conditions to question persons reasonably suspected of being illegal aliens, which Governor Jan Brewer and the state legislature had been working on for months. With the passage of this controversial bill, the state of Arizona became ground zero in the impassioned debate over illegal immigration. The Democrats and the media went into overdrive, denouncing the state and its governor as racists and Nazis.Governor Brewer, a lifelong Arizona resident with deep ties to the community, was first elected to the Arizona House of Representatives in 1982, and hasn&#8217;t lost an election since. As a state official, she watched with increasing dismay as illegal immigration exploded across Arizona&#8217;s border, and noticed the devastating effect it was having on the state. Causing an escalation in violence, an influx of drugs, and prisons and hospitals to fill to overflowing, this problem was not only wreaking havoc on the moral fabric of the community but placing an even greater strain on Arizona&#8217;s beleaguered health, educational, and social welfare networks. Growing frustrated with the failure of the federal government to respond to her pleas for assistance, Governor Brewer led the state to action.Scorpions for Breakfastis Brewer&#8217;s commonsense account of her fight to secure our nation&#8217;s border in the face of persistent federal inaction.

The second and more terrible is that his beloved Beatrice has been murdered, and her soul pulled down into hell by a dark force.

Gaiman tackles everything from the onslaught of the information age to the meaning of death, but he doesn't sacrifice the razor-sharp plotting and narrative style he's been delivering since hisSandmandays.Shadow gets out of prison early when his wife is killed in a car crash. At a loss, he takes up with a mysterious character called Wednesday, who is much more than he appears. In fact, Wednesday is an old god, once known as Odin the All-father, who is roaming America rounding up his forgotten fellows in preparation for an epic battle against the upstart deities of the Internet, credit cards, television, and all that is wired. Shadow agrees to help Wednesday, and they whirl through a psycho-spiritual storm that becomes all too real in its manifestations. For instance, Shadow's dead wife Laura keeps showing up, and not just as a ghost--the difficulty of their continuing relationship is by turns grim and darkly funny, just like the rest of the book.Armed only with some coin tricks and a sense of purpose, Shadow travels through, around, and underneath the visible surface of things, digging up all the powerful myths Americans brought with them in their journeys to this land as well as the ones that were already here. Shadow's road story is the heart of the novel, and it's here that Gaiman offers up the details that make this such a cinematic book--the distinctly American foods and diversions, the bizarre roadside attractions, the decrepit gods reduced to shell games and prostitution. \"This is a bad land for Gods,\" says Shadow.More than a tourist in America, but not a native, Neil Gaiman offers an outside-in and inside-out perspective on the soul and spirituality of the country--our obsessions with money and power, our jumbled religious heritage and its societal outcomes, and the millennial decisions we face about what's real and what's not.--Therese Littleton--This text refers to theHardcoveredition.",

In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

Following a botched circumcision, a family is convinced to raise their infant son, Bruce, as a girl. They rename the child Brenda and spend the next 14 years trying to transform him into a her. Brenda's childhood reads as one filled with anxiety and loneliness, and her fear and confusion are present on nearly every page concerning her early childhood. Much of her pain is caused by Dr. Money, who is presented as a villainous medical man attempting to coerce an unwilling child to submit to numerous unpleasant treatments.Reading over interviews and reports of decisions made by this doctor, it's difficult to contain anger at the widespread results of his insistence that natural-born gender can be altered with little more than willpower and hormone treatments. The attempts of his parents, twin brother, and extended family to assist Brenda to be happily female are touching--the sense is overwhelmingly of a family wanting to do \"right\" while being terribly mislead as to what \"right\" is for her. As Brenda makes the decision to live life as a male (at age 14), she takes the name David and begins the process of reversing the effects of estrogen treatments. David's ultimately successful life--a solid marriage, honest and close family relationships, and his bravery in making his childhood public--bring an uplifting end to his story. Equally fascinating is the latest segment of the longtime nature/nurture controversy, and the interviews of various psychological researchers and practitioners form a larger framework around David's struggle to live as the gender he was meant to be.--Jill Lightner",

        "0061826871": "Product DescriptionTheNew York Timesbestselling author of the Wicked Lovely series delivers her first novel for adults, a story about the living, the dead, and a curse that binds them.Rebekkah Barrow never forgot the tender attention her grandmother, Maylene, bestowed upon the dead of Claysville, the town where Bek spent her adolescence. There wasn't a funeral that Maylene didn't attend, and at each Rebekkah watched as Maylene performed the same unusual ritual: three sips from a small silver flask followed by the words \"Sleep well, and stay where I put you.\"Now Maylene is dead and Bek must go back to the place--and the man--she left a decade ago. But what she soon discovers is that Maylene was murdered and that there was good reason for her odd traditions. It turns out that in placid Claysville, the worlds of the living and the dead are dangerously connected. Beneath the town lies a shadowy, lawless land ruled by the enigmatic Charles, aka Mr. D--a place from which the dead will return if their graves are not properly minded. Only the Graveminder, a Barrow woman, and the current Undertaker, Byron, can set things to right once the dead begin to walk.A Q&amp;A with Author Melissa MarrQ:What inspires you as a writer?Marr:Music, travel, and lore.Graveminderbegan in 2007 on a trip to Ireland during which I&rsquo;d read a paragraph or so on the &ldquo;hungry dead.&rdquo;Wicked Lovelysparked from Scottish folklore. The YA novel I just wrote,Carnival of Souls, was a combination of a phrase from a song and an article on demonology.Q:Where did the story inGravemindercome from? Did something in particular spark the characters or the plot?Marr:Once I had the general concept (&ldquo;mind your dead lest they come back hungry&rdquo;), I looked to my own life. I enjoy cemeteries, and I&rsquo;m fascinated by lore/myth of Death. I added a small town, a ghost-town-esque land of the dead, and various other things I like. This is actually the novel closest to my roots in many ways.Q:The characters inGraveminderdiscover they have had a destiny to fulfill since they were born. Can you talk about putting characters into that situation and what it brings out in them?Marr:Between the Wicked Lovely series and this, it&rsquo;s pretty obvious I&rsquo;m fascinated by the idea of fate and choice. I think we are all born with advantages and disadvantages because of so many things beyond our control (family, economics, culture, religion, country, genetic factors). People can be defined by those factors, revise their fate&mdash;or opt for some combination of the two.  That choice is what makes our stories as people unique.Q:How did you go about building the Graveminder mythology? Is it based on any folklore or mythology itself?Marr:Around the world there are all sorts of traditions of ancestor regard and duty to the dead. Some traditions dictate how the dead are taken to the grave to keep them from finding their way back if they wake; some traditions include speaking (or not speaking) of them. There are myriad traditions I&rsquo;d have loved to explore, but the one I used at base is that the dead must be nourished with food, drink, and story for a set time. Failure results in the dead coming back to get a different manifestation of the nourishment they need&mdash;flesh, blood, and breath.Q:InGraveminderthe dead walk among the living and the living can even walk among the dead. What are your thoughts about these two worlds you&rsquo;ve created?Marr:I like liminality, borders and those who exist on and because of the lines. Much of the real world is defined by a series of in/out groupings. We are either a or b; things are good or bad; and everything is pro or con. The reality, I believe, is that there are often gradations&mdash;degrees of right and wrong, measures of beautiful and horrible. By juxtaposing worlds, I have characters who are always &ldquo;strangers in a strange land.&rdquo; Plus, well, it&rsquo;s just morefunto write.",

Now 20, and still in love, Miranda's designs are thwarted by the indiscretions of Nigel's late wife&mdash;heartbroken, Nigel isn't willing to risk another shot at love, even if it means hurting his close friend Miranda. Quinn's pitch-perfect humor remains intact, but her latest relies too much on romance conventions, including Miranda's scholarly but benignly neglectful father; an even more overused device involves Turner's hot-and-cold feelings toward Miranda, which reduce the heroine to tears more than once. However, the two make a lovable couple, and Miranda in particular shines, as do Turner's two siblings in strong secondary roles.

Nothing is as it seems from that moment on, and Phoebe's longtime fear of a dark man in the shadows seeps back after she discovers, in true woo-woo fashion, that she is pregnant.

        "0062291408": "*Starred Review* In her last novel, Maya&#x2019;s Notebook (2013), Allende illuminated a criminal underworld. Now she nimbly joins her detective novelist husband, William C. Gordon, in writing crime fiction. Given her signature combination of bewitching imagination and social gravitas, Allende creates a compassionate and gripping mystery stoked by the paradoxes of family and community and the consequences of abuse. Super-smart high-school senior Amanda Mart&#xED;n is obsessed with an Internet role-playing game, Ripper (as in Jack), and oversees a group comprising four other brilliant misfit teens from around the world as well as her grandfather, who raised her after her very young parents divorced. Amanda&#x2019;s father, Bob, is a deputy chief of homicide in the San Francisco police department. Her mother, Indiana, is a healer too kind for her own good who is romantically entangled with a former navy SEAL and a wealthy dilettante. As Amanda and her cyber-brigade investigate a series of ritualistic murders no one else believes are connected, Allende richly portrays a range of intriguing characters, from Ayani, a famous Ethiopian model and women&#x2019;s rights activist, to Attila, a heroic war dog. Sensitive to inequality, injustice, and psychological complexity and touching on everything from aromatherapy to illegal immigrants to PTSD, Allende&#x2019;s tightly plotted tale of crimes obvious and masked is sharply perceptive, utterly charming, and intensely suspenseful.HIGH-DEMAND BACK STORY: Best-selling Allende&#x2019;s leap into crime fiction will be energetically promoted with a national author tour and a publicity blitz directed at both her fans and mystery enthusiasts. --Donna Seaman",

        "0061999245": "Like the series it inspired, Kellerman's award-winning 1986 debut novel combines police procedure, via hard-boiled LAPD detective Peter Decker, with Judaic rites and rituals courtesy of its heroine Rina Lazarus, an ultra-Orthodox widowed mother of two. Decker and Lazarus are brought together by the brutal rape of a young bride-to-be at the mikvah (a bathhouse used in the purification ritual) that Rina manages in the Hollywood hills. Mitchell Greenberg nicely vocalizes the story from Decker's point of view, with the detective struggling to stick to his sleuthing in spite of his developing feelings for Rina. The novel continually rings true, from explaining various Orthodox beliefs and customs to Decker and his crew's no-nonsense unmasking of the villain. Greenberg moves in and out of the novel's elements smoothly and efficiently. He paces the police work with just the right sense of urgency and frustration; handles the romantic sequences with the proper emotion and without a hint of sentimentality; and breezes through the many Jewish-centric passages with the confidence and clarity of a yeshiva graduate.An Avon paperback.

In the third in Lemony Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events, there is still no hope on the horizon for these poor children. Their adventures are exciting and memorable, but, as the author points out, \"exciting and memorable like being chased by a werewolf through a field of thorny bushes at midnight with nobody around to help you.\"This story begins when the orphans are being escorted by the well-meaning Mr. Poe to yet another distant relative who has agreed to take them in since their parents were killed in a horrible fire. Aunt Josephine, their new guardian, is their second cousin's sister-in-law, and she is afraid of everything. Her house (perched precariously on a cliff above Lake Lachrymose) is freezing because she is afraid of the radiator exploding, she eats cold cucumber soup because she's afraid of the stove, and she doesn't answer the telephone due to potential electrocution dangers. Her greatest joy in life is grammar, however, and when it comes to the proper use of the English language, she is fearless.But just when she should be the most fearful--when Count Olaf creeps his way back to find the Baudelaire orphans and steal their fortune--she somehow lets her guard down. Once again, it is up to Violet, Klaus, and Sunny to get themselves out of danger. Will they succeed? We haven't the stomach to tell you.

        "0060081961": "Millions of American soldiers, many of whom had never left their hometowns before, crossed the nation by rail during the years of World War II on their way to training camps and distant theaters of battle. In a little town in Nebraska, countless thousands of them met with extraordinary hospitality--the \"miracle\" of veteran journalist Bob Greene's title. \"The best America there ever was. Or at least, whatever might be left of it.\" So Greene writes of North Platte, now a quiet town along the interstate, its main street all but dead. It was a quiet town then, too, at the outbreak of the war, but still a hive of activity as its citizens gathered to provide, at their own expense, coffee, sandwiches, books, playing cards, and time to the scared young men who rolled through by the trainload, \"telling them that their country cared about them.\" Greene's pages are full of the voices of those who were there, soldiers and townspeople alike, who took part in what amounted to small acts of heroism, given the shortages and rationing of the time. Greene, generous in his praise if rather disheartened by the modern world, against which he contrasts the past, turns in a remarkable account of the home front. It deserves the widest audience.---Gregory McNamee",

Well, one way would be to meet a real spy. But then, of course, they might be a bit hard to spot (that's in the job description, after all). Or better, read an excellent new novel by a former spy, one who has the gifts of a born storyteller.Spycatcheris such a novel. And Matthew Dunn is that very talented new author. I know of no other spy thriller that so successfully blends the fascinating nuances of the business of espionage and intelligence work with full-throttle suspense storytelling.&rdquo; --Jeffery DeaverAmazon Exclusive: Jeffrey Deaver Interviews Matthew DunnJeffrey Deaver:Matthew, why did you choose to write under your own name and not a pseudonym? Isn&rsquo;t that what most people who&rsquo;ve written about espionage work have done? Are there risks to using your own name?Matthew Dunn:When I was a spy I always operated under completely different identities. At the beginning of every mission, I felt like an actor taking to the stage on the first night. Though an actor can take off his or her costume at the end of the night, often I could not do so for months and in some cases years. I decided to write under my own name for three reasons: First, I wanted to do something that had my real name attached to my work. Second, I felt my readers deserved to know who I really am. And third, I felt it would be cowardly to hide behind another name since I am no longer a spy. Yes, there are severe and immediate risks, and I&rsquo;m conscious of them every day. But I&rsquo;ve chosen those risks. If a team comes for me, I&rsquo;ll deal with it.JD:What kind of man or woman makes an ideal field officer&mdash;one who runs agents?MD:There are many quantifiable traits &ndash; intellect, skills in lateral thinking, a gregarious personality (deployed in exact moments), an unwavering belief that anything is possible, the ability to manipulate, ruthlessness, compassion, leadership, the ability to make rifle-shot decisions, and tremendous courage. But ultimately MI6, the CIA, the French DGSE, the Russian SVR (the successor to the KGB) and Mossad &ndash; that is, the truly &ldquo;global&rdquo; intelligence services &ndash; recruit a particular breed of animal to work as an agent, and one knows that animal when one sees her or him.  That person is simply different from everyone else. If you are a good field officer, your agent (i.e. the foreign national you&rsquo;ve recruited to spy on his country) will trust you with his life. He won&rsquo;t risk execution by working for just MI6 or whatever institution you represent &ndash; he&rsquo;ll do it for you.JD:How autonomous does a field officer have to be? And is operating solo an advantage in the world of intelligence and espionage?MD:Intelligence officers are lone wolves. It&rsquo;s vital that they don&rsquo;t make themselves visible.  One can&rsquo;t get the best intelligence by using a sledgehammer approach. To that extent, there are no &ldquo;superior forces or big guns&rdquo; when you&rsquo;re in the field. Your country&rsquo;s army, navy, and air force are the inferior forces that are liable to get it wrong. And that means you can&rsquo;t trust or use them. But if you mess up and get caught, you will die.JD:Can you describe the operation for which you were awarded an unusual, special commendation by the British government?MD:I can, but I won&rsquo;t.JD:Good call. If you had answered, maybeI'dhave found one of those red laser dots on my forehead&hellip; If there's one vital lesson to be learned in foreign intelligence training, what is it?MD:Mind-set is key. An MI6 officer believes that he or she can achieve anything and very often that self-belief is justified. MI6 is far and away the best intelligence organization at encouraging that outlook. As a result, and based on what it has achieved, it is without doubt the best intelligence organization in the world.JD:What do you mean when you say, &ldquo;When a gun comes out on a deep-cover mission, it&rsquo;s the worst thing that can happen?&rdquo; Talk a bit about the physical aspects of espionage.MD:Officers are typically trained to use guns in tight, urban situations, to deploy highly aggressive and effective unarmed military combat techniques, and to do whatever is necessary to get out of a situation. But the primary role of a spy is to collect intelligence. When guns are deployed &ndash; certain direct actions excluded &ndash; something has gone wrong. Even when things have gone wrong, many good spies would prefer to die and maintain the integrity of the operation than to pull a weapon. No good intelligence comes out of a fight or torture; these actions only result in the pleadings of a man who wants to live. Morality aside, the CIA&rsquo;s use of water boarding made men say anything to keep from drowning. Saying anything, or even providing &ldquo;good information,&rdquo; is a million miles away from providing intelligence, (i.e. something that is most certainly not public knowledge). For that reason and to their peril, the British learned that torture was ineffective in the Boer War. Guns and torture are anathema to intelligence-gathering activities, but they are also bedfellows.JD:Is it hard for retiring foreign-service officers to adapt to private life?MD:Most people who leave are achievers. They get jobs in the top ranks of industry, commerce, government, or maybe some place similar in the arts. But all of us struggle. We are trained to believe that we are better than everyone else when the reality is that we are not. We&rsquo;ve simply seen different, odd things and had to do a job that requires inordinate self-belief. It&rsquo;s taken me ten years to adjust to not being a spy. I&rsquo;m still adjusting.JD:What about the service do you miss?MD:I miss the friendships I had with my foreign agents. They would do the most unbelievably brave things for me, but would always be aware of the danger they were in and their own mortality. I respected them and loved them more than MI6 or anyone else, and that is how it is supposed to be. My agents were my family. We laughed together in one-on-one meetings in swanky hotels and war-zone ditches. We cried together. I held their hands and told them to be brave. I watched the fear and defiance in their eyes as they went back to their tasks. But I was never Matthew Dunn. I was someone else even if the emotion was real. I miss my agents, but they don&rsquo;t miss me because they never knew who I was. I regret that more than anything.",

        "0061430234": "Cheney, a former L.A. entertainment lawyer, pointedly dispels expectations of a safe ride through this turbulent account of bipolar disorder. With evocative imagery&mdash;time-shuffled recollections meant to mirror her disorienting extremes of mood&mdash;Cheney conjures life at the mercy of a brain chemistry that yanks her from soul-starving despair to raucous exuberance, impetuous pursuits to paralyzing lethargy. Caught in a riptide of febrile impulse, she caroms from seductions to suicide attempts while flirting recklessly with men, danger and death, only to find more hazards in the drastic side effects of treatment. More than a train-wreck tearjerker, the memoir draws strength from salient observations that expose the frustrations of bipolar disorder, from its brutal sabotage of romance and friendship to the challenge it poses to the simplest emotions, such as the terrors of being happy that augur mania's onset. Though she sustains an ominous mood and relays horrifying incidents with icy candor, Cheney lightens up at times, as when she marvels at the ease of masking her condition at an office that brings out everyone's manic side. But the narrative hopscotch frustrates readers' need for grounding and context that might clear up Cheney's muddled history and satisfy readers' urge to learn the fallout of her impulse-driven episodes. Her startlingly lucid descriptions of illness merit a more concise chronology.(Feb.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

Erdrich's 13th novel, a multigenerational tour de force of sin, redemption, murder and vengeance, finds its roots in the 1911 slaughter of a farming family near Pluto, N.Dak. The family's infant daughter is spared, and a posse forms, incorrectly blames three Indians and lynches them. One, Mooshum Milk, miraculously survives. Over the next century, descendants of both the hanged men and the lynch mob develop relationships that become deeply entangled, and their disparate stories are held together via principal narrator Evelina, Mooshum Milk's granddaughter, who comes of age on an Indian reservation near Pluto in the 1960s and '70s and forms two fateful adolescent crushes: one on bad-boy schoolmate Corwin Peace and one on a nun. Though Evelina doesn't know it, both are descendants of lynch mob members. The plot splinters as Evelina enrolls in college and finds work at a mental asylum; Corwin spirals into a life of crime; and a long-lost violin (its backstory is another beautiful piece of the mosaic) takes on massive significance. Erdrich plays individual narratives off one another, dropping apparently insignificant clues that build to head-slapping revelations as fates intertwine and the person responsible for the 1911 killing is identified.(May)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0060594667": "Product DescriptionEdgar Award-winning author Tom Franklin returns with his most accomplished and resonant novel so far&#x2014;an atmospheric drama set in rural Mississippi. In the late 1970s, Larry Ott and Silas \"32\" Jones were boyhood pals. Their worlds were as different as night and day: Larry, the child of lower-middle-class white parents, and Silas, the son of a poor, single black mother. Yet for a few months the boys stepped outside of their circumstances and shared a special bond. But then tragedy struck: Larry took a girl on a date to a drive-in movie, and she was never heard from again. She was never found and Larry never confessed, but all eyes rested on him as the culprit. The incident shook the county&#x2014;and perhaps Silas most of all. His friendship with Larry was broken, and then Silas left town.More than twenty years have passed. Larry, a mechanic, lives a solitary existence, never able to rise above the whispers of suspicion. Silas has returned as a constable. He and Larry have no reason to cross paths until another girl disappears and Larry is blamed again. And now the two men who once called each other friend are forced to confront the past they've buried and ignored for decades.A Q&amp;A with Author Tom FranklinQ:Tell us a bit about your latest bookCrooked Letter, Crooked Letter. How did you come up with the title?Franklin:Title's a pneumonic device used to teach children (mostly southern children) how to spell Mississippi.  M, I, crooked-letter, crooked-letter, I, crooked-letter, crooked-letter, I, humpback, humback, I.Q:Crooked Letter, Crooked Letteris a bit of a departure from your previous two novels&#x2014;SmonkandHell at the Breech&#x2014;in that it is set in contemporary times and the story line is a bit less dark. What inspired the premise for this novel and the departure from a more historical setting?Franklin:I'd been wanting to write about a small town police officer, and I'd long had the image of a loner mechanic in my mind.  When I put the two together, the story began to form.  I used a lot of autobiographical stuff for Larry, the mechanic.Q:A review inUSA Today(forHell at the Breech) stated that, &#x201C;he also makes his characters rise up from the pages as if they were there with you.&#x201D; &#x2026;and this is certainly true in your latest novel. How do you approach the task of developing your characters and bringing them to life? Are the characters inCrooked Letter, Crooked Letterbased on anyone in particular?Franklin:They're both a combination of different facets of different people, a conglomeration of fact and fiction.  I usually try to just let them begin to do what they want to do, just put them in a situation and see what they do.  When they begin to surprise me, do things I hadn't anticipated, that's when it's working.But the character of Silas \"32\" Jones is very loosely based on the sole police officer of the hamlet of Dickinson, Alabama, where I grew up.  This guy was actually the law in a nearby mill town, and my hamlet of Dickinson fell in his tiny jurisdiction.  I've always loved the idea of small town cops, especially one who might be a kind of underdog to the police forces of nearby larger towns.Q:InCrooked Letter, Crooked Letteryour two main characters are anything but stereotypical&#x2014;the young black boy goes off to college to play baseball and comes back to be the town constable and the young white boy is the accused murderer and the town outcast. What, if anything, prompted you to portray these characters this way?Franklin:No real person is a stereotype, and I try to make my characters as real as I can.  We're all a mess of contradictions and secrets, strangenesses and desires, and nobody's all good or all bad.  We're all somewhere in the spectrum between absolute good and absolute evil.  So I just try to find a character who's fairly normal, and put him or her in a fix and see how he or she negotiates it to see, as Kurt Vonnegut says, what he or she is made of. In this case, the story as I came to understand it called for Larry to stay home and Silas to leave.  If it had been the other way around, I'd still work to make the characters unstereotypical.Q:Without giving away too much of the story, what is one thing (emotion, thought) that readers can expect to walk away with after reading this book?Franklin:It's a sad book, but it's full of hope.  Hope is what I want a reader to leave with.Q:Historically the South has not always had a positive image in other parts of the country. How has your experience growing up and living in the rural South shaped your talent as a writer? And have you ever felt the need to justify or redeem the South&#x2019;s past in any of your works?Franklin:I think growing up in the south made me the person I am, and the writer I am comes from that.  So, yes, the south's made me the writer I am.  It taught me to listen to the cadences and rhythms of speech, and to notice the landscape.  It also has this defeated feel, a lingering of old sin, that makes it sweet in a rotting kind of way.  Much of it is poor, much is rural, and that's an interesting combination, a deep well for stories.Q:Did you always know that you wanted to be a writer? Who are some writers, past and present, that you admire or have inspired you?Franklin:I always knew I wanted to tell stories, one way or another.  If I'd had a video camera in the mid 1970s I'm sure I'd be a filmmaker now.  But I just had a portable typewriter, and so the stories I could tell were ones on paper.Q:You are one of the most celebrated writers in the field, and have been compared to the likes ofHarper Lee,William Faulkner, andElmore Leonard.  What do you believe is the one thing that sets you apart from other contemporary writers in your genre?Franklin:What sets me apart?  I honestly don't know that I&#x2019;m more \"apart\" from other writers of my generation.  Landscape plays a large role in what I write, but that's true of many other writers.  My stuff is set in the south, but that's true of others as well.  I don't know, honestly.Q:As a professor of English, what is one piece of advice that you would share with aspiring writers?Franklin:Read, starting with the classics.  Read all the time.  If you don't read, you won't ever be a writer.  Also, write.  This seems obvious, but it's amazing how many \"writers\" don't write very much.",

God was presumed integral to the universe, so discerning how it worked was a quest as theological as it was intellectual. By directing readers to the deistic drive in their famous achievements, Dolnick accents what otherwise strikes moderns as strange, such as Newton&#x2019;s obsession with alchemy and biblical hermeneutics. Those pursuits held codes to God&#x2019;s mind, as did motion and, especially, planetary motion, and Dolnick&#x2019;s substance follows the greats&#x2019; progress in code-breaking, depicting Kepler&#x2019;s mathematical thought process in devising his laws, Galileo&#x2019;s in breaking out the vectors of falling objects, Newton&#x2019;s and Leibniz&#x2019;s in inventing calculus, and Newton&#x2019;s in formulating his laws of gravitation. Including apt biographical detail, Dolnick humanizes the group, socializes them by means of their connections to such coevals as the members of the nascent Royal Society, and captures their mental coexistence in mysticism and rationality. A concise explainer, Dolnick furnishes a fine survey introduction to a fertile field of scientific biography and history. --Gilbert Taylor",

It was gorgeous and unfamiliar and deeply fascinating.  Unfortunately, I stayed there for ten days.  There are a lot of insects in the Amazon, a lot of mud, surprisingly few vegetables, too many snakes.  You can&rsquo;t go anywhere by yourself, which makes sense if you don&rsquo;t know the terrain, but I enjoy going places by myself.  I can see how great it would be for a very short visit, and how great it would be if you lived there and had figured out what was and wasn&rsquo;t going to kill you, but the interim length of time isn&rsquo;t great.EG:Didn't I hear that you have a sort of magical story about a friend who is also a writer, who was also once going to write a book about the Amazon? Can you share this miraculous tale? Also, is your writer friend pretty?AP:This friend of mine, who happens to be you, is gorgeous, and much taller in real life.  Yes, you were writing a novel about the Amazon, and then you decided not to write a novel about the Amazon, and then I started writing a novel about the Amazon, and later when we compared notes (your book dismissed, mine halfway finished) they had remarkably similar story lines, to the point of being eerie.   I thought this must be because it was an incredibly banal idea and we had both come up with a generic Amazon novel, but then you told me that ideas fly around looking for homes, and when the idea hadn&rsquo;t worked out with you it came to me.   If this is true I think your name should be on the cover.  It would increase sales significantly.EG:Readers of your prior work--particularly the luminousBel Canto--will be delighted to see that opera makes an appearance in this novel, as well. In fact, one of the most dramatic scenes in the book takes place at the opera. Is that a wink and a nod to loyal readers, or just an expression of your own deep and abiding musical passions?AP:It&rsquo;s a wink and a nod to Werner Herzog and his brilliant Amazon film &ldquo;Fitzcarraldo&rdquo; which opens at the opera house in Manaus where the aforementioned scene takes place.  I had very little experience with opera when I wroteBel Canto, and since then it&rsquo;s become a huge part of my life.  It was fun to write a scene set at the opera now that I know what I&rsquo;m talking about.EG:State of Wondera rollicking adventure story, full of peril and bravery and death-defying action. I personally know you to be a homebody who likes to bake muffins for neighbors. How the heck did you pull off this wildness so convincingly? Was it as invigorating to write as it is to read?AP:Ah, the life of the mind.  All the adventure I need I can dream up in my kitchen.  I love writing outside of my own experience, making imaginary worlds.  If I wrote novels based on my own life I would not be making a living at this.  I also love to write a strong plot.  I want things to happen in my books, I want to be thrilled.  I always think about Raymond Chandler.

The brutality seems unending--beatings, starvation, attempted rape, mental cruelty--and yet the narrator (a young girl) never stops fighting for escape and survival. Sad and courageous, her life and the lives of her young siblings provide quite a powerful example of how war can so deeply affect children--especially a war in which they are trained to be an integral part of the armed forces. For anyone interested in Cambodia's recent history, this book shares a valuable personal view of events.--Jill Lightner",

And even though such organisms would not likely be able to harm humans, the possibility exists that first contact might be our last.That's the scientific supposition that Michael Crichton formulates and follows out to its conclusion in his excellent debut novel,The Andromeda Strain.A Nobel-Prize-winning bacteriologist, Jeremy Stone, urges the president to approve an extraterrestrial decontamination facility to sterilize returning astronauts, satellites, and spacecraft that might carry an \"unknown biologic agent.\" The government agrees, almost too quickly, to build the top-secret Wildfire Lab in the desert of Nevada. Shortly thereafter, unbeknownst to Stone, the U.S. Army initiates the \"Scoop\" satellite program, an attempt to actively collect space pathogens for use in biological warfare. When Scoop VII crashes a couple years later in the isolated Arizona town of Piedmont, the Army ends up getting more than it asked for.The Andromeda Strainfollows Stone and rest of the scientific team mobilized to react to the Scoop crash as they scramble to understand and contain a strange and deadly outbreak. Crichton's first book may well be his best; it has an earnestness that is missing from his later, more calculated thrillers.--Paul Hughes--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

Through a series of paired questions and answers, the rabbit is queried about why he is sitting in, standing on, spraying, or wearing a box. Each time, he insists, \"It's not a box!\" and the opposite page reveals the many things a small child's pretending can make of one: a race car, a mountain, a burning building, a robot. One important caveat: the younger end of the intended audience is both literal and concrete in their approach to this material. The box itself, drawn as a one-dimensional rectangle, will be perceived by preschoolers to be flat and not readily understood as three-dimensional. Furthermore, those children are likely to interpret the \"box's\" transformation to be \"magic,\" while five- and six-year-olds are able to make the cognitive conversion from flat rectangle to three-dimensional box and to understand that the transformation has been made by the rabbit's own imagination. Both audiences will enjoy the participatory aspect of identifying each of the rabbit's new inventions. Knowledgeable adults will bring along a large box to aid in understanding and to encourage even more ideas and play.&mdash;Kate McClelland, Perrot Memorial Library, Old Greenwich, CTCopyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The wants and fears are the day-to-day things that occupy their minds, like wanting to see friends or get married and fearing death or being rejected for a kiss. Satisfy their wants, and they become more efficient at completing tasks you assign them. Realize their fears, and Sims become lethargic, cranky, and unresponsive to your commands. Aspirations are the big-picture things, like raising a family, becoming wealthy, and gaining knowledge. Succeed here and you'll be able to buy odd gifts for your Sim to improve his or her life, like a money tree that pays dividends or a \"fountain of youth\" water cooler.What Else Is New?Of course, you wouldn't be able to juggle all that if it weren't for the improved \"Free Will\" option, which makes it easier for Sims to fulfill their basic needs. The artificial intelligence of the game is noticeably improved; they won't turn on radios just as a family member is going to bed but, strangely, they do occasionally put their dishes on the floor.Another big change in the series is the concept of the lifespan. Now Sims are born with the traits of their parents, families grow, and Sims grow old. Not only does this go hand in hand with aspirations (growing up is the first aspiration that a baby Sim will have), it provides a limited time with which your Sims can achieve their goals.The Universal Control Panel helps you manage your Sim family.A Family AffairThe Sims 2not only lets you create just about any type of Sim in any type of family, build elaborate houses, and even create a neighborhood from scratch, but it also allows you to start the gamein medias res, with premade households. These families all have backstories that are smart spoofs of soap-opera plots--lots of scheming, romance, ghosts, and family fighting. Parents of teens shouldn't worry, though, because nudity is tastefully blurred out and \"woo-hoo\" between Sims takes place completely under the covers. The ESRB has given this a Teen rating. IfThe Sims 2were a film, it would likely land between PG and PG-13.The makers have included some nice tools to help share the universe you've created. For example, you can capture in-game stills and video to show friends the private moments, family interactions, and house parties of your Sims. You can even package a household to share as a blog or an album on a special Web site.The Sims 2is for patient gamers. Like life itself, the game is filled with mundane details, like getting ready for work and doing dishes. The game also demands a level of creativity from its players that the run-and-gun game genres wouldn't know what to do with. But those who stick with it will be rewarded with an absorbing, amusing diversion and a virtual family history that they've created themselves.--Porter B.

New to Atlanta, finance specialist Belinda Hennessey is glad to have her carpool mates to take her mind off her failed marriage. Before she can get too comfortable, however, she hits Officer Wade Alexander's police cruiser, misses a crucial meeting and clashes with her malevolent boss, Margo, who wants her to overlook the fact that the company they're merging with may have fudged its numbers. Belinda reluctantly agrees and then finds herself in hot water when Margo turns up dead. Though at times too gullible for her own good, Belinda comes into her own over the course of the novel. Her uncertainties about her job, her zany friends and her budding relationship with Wade are ably portrayed, as is the setting (Bond describes Atlanta's traffic as only a resident could).

        "0099416158": "Ever since he publishedThe Firmin 1991, John Grisham has remained the undisputed champ of the legal thriller. WithA Painted House, however, he strikes out in a new direction. As the author is quick to note, this novel includes \"not a single lawyer, dead or alive,\" and readers will search in vain for the kind of lowlife machinations that have been his stock-in-trade. Instead, Grisham has delivered a quieter, more contemplative story, set in rural Arkansas in 1952. It's harvest time on the Chandler farm, and the family has hired a crew of migrant Mexicans and \"hill people\" to pick 80 acres of cotton. A certain camaraderie pervades this bucolic dream team. But it's backbreaking work, particularly for the 7-year-old narrator, Luke: \"I would pick cotton, tearing the fluffy bolls from the stalks at a steady pace, stuffing them into the heavy sack, afraid to look down the row and be reminded of how endless it was, afraid to slow down because someone would notice.\"What's more, tensions begin to simmer between the Mexicans and the hill people, one of whom has a penchant for bare-knuckles brawling. This leads to a brutal murder, which young Luke has the bad luck to witness. At this point--with secrets, lies, and at least one knife fight in the offing--the plot begins to take on that familiar, Grisham-style momentum. Still, such matters ultimately take a back seat inA Painted Houseto the author's evocation of time and place. This is, after all, the scene of his boyhood, and Grisham waxes nostalgic without ever succumbing to deep-fried sentimentality. Meanwhile, his account of Luke's Baptist upbringing occasions some sly (and telling) humor:I'd been taught in Sunday school from the day I could walk that lying would send you straight to hell. No detours. No second chances. Straight into the fiery pit, where Satan was waiting with the likes of Hitler and Judas Iscariot and General Grant. Thou shalt not bear false witness, which, of course, didn't sound exactly like a strict prohibition against lying, but that was the way the Baptists interpreted it.Whether Grisham will continue along these lines, or revert to the judicial shark tank for his next book, is anybody's guess. ButA Painted Housesuggests that he's perfectly capable of telling an involving story with nary a subpoena in sight.--James Marcus--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

While this might seem like a no-brainer, Prose (Blue Angel;A Changed Man) masterfully meditates on how quality reading informs great writing, which will warm the cold, jaded hearts of even the most frustrated, unappreciated and unpublished writers. Chapters treat the nuts and bolts of writing (words, sentences, paragraphs) as well as issues of craft (narration, character, dialogue), all of which Prose discusses using story or novel excerpts. This is where the book truly shines; Prose is remarkably egalitarian in choosing exemplars of fiction: David Gates, Denis Johnson, John le Carr&eacute; and ZZ Packer, for instance, are considered as seriously as Chekhov, Melville, Flaubert or Babel. Prose insists that \"literature not only breaks the rules, but makes us realize that thereare none,\" and urges writers to re-read the classics (Chekhov, especially) and view \"reading as something that might move or delight you.\" Prose's guide to reading and writing belongs on every writer's bookshelf alongside E.M.

        "0060873027": "Amazon Exclusive: &ldquo;Microis Anything But Small&rdquo; by James RollinsAn avid spelunker and scuba enthusiast,James Rollinsholds a doctorate in veterinary medicine  and is the author of theNew York Timesbest-selling Sigma Force series, the most recent of which isThe Devil Colony.First I have to admit, Michael Crichton is why I write.  In fact, if not for his books, I&rsquo;d probably still be a practicing veterinarian in Northern California, dealing with flea allergies, ear infections, and all manner of medical maladies.  It was Crichton&rsquo;s stories of wild adventures, his explorations into the strange frontiers of science, and his truly ripped-from-the-headlines plotting that inspired me to set down my own scalpel and stethoscope and pick up pen and paper.But his influence went beyond mere heady inspiration.  His books also served as a tutorial into the practicalities of storytelling.  When I tackled my first novel (a deep-earth adventure titledSubterranean), I continually kept a copy ofJurassic Parkon the shelf above my desk.  That book became my roadmap on how to build a story&rsquo;s structure:  who dies first and when, at what point do we see the first dinosaur, how do you fold science into a novel without stagnating the flow?  That old copy ofJurassic Parkremains dog-eared and heavily highlighted, and it still holds a cherished place on my bookshelf.So I dove into Crichton&rsquo;s latest novel,Micro, with some trepidation, fearing how a collaborative effort might tarnish his great body of work.  Now, to be fair, I&rsquo;d also read Richard Preston&rsquo;s nonfiction masterpiece of scientific horror and intrigue,The Hot Zone.  That book was as brilliant as it was terrifying.  But still I wondered, could Preston take Crichton&rsquo;s story and truly do it justice?In a word:YES.In two words,HELL YES.Microis pure Crichton.   Dare I say,vintageCrichton, harkening back to the scientific intrigue ofAndromeda Strain, to the exploration of the natural world covered inCongo, and to the adventure and thrills ofThe Lost World.   As only Crichton can, he has taken a scientific concept as wild as the one he tackled inTimelineand exceeded in making it chillingly real.  It took a clever quirk of genetics and cloning to give rise to the dinosaurs inJurassic Park.  Likewise, a twist of science in Micro calls forth a new horror out of the natural world&mdash;but not just one line of threat.  In this book, the entire biosphere becomes a vast and deadly playground.  Its depiction is both darkly beautiful and stunningly dreadful.  It is a terrain as foreign as any hostile planet, yet as close as our own backyard.  To tell more would ruin a great adventure that will have you looking out your window with new eyes.Similarly, this lethal and toxic terrain must be traversed by a band of gutsy heroes.  But in typical Crichton style, these are not elite commandos or a highly trained black ops team.  They&rsquo;re simply a group of graduate students&mdash;each uniquely talented and flawed&mdash;gathered from various scientific disciplines:  entomology, toxicology, botany, biochemistry.  They must learn to combine resources and ingenuities to survive and ultimately thwart a danger threatening to break free into the world at large, all the while pursued by a sociopath as cunning as he is sadistic.In the end,Microhas everything you&rsquo;d expect in a Crichton novel&mdash;and so much more.  But the greatest achievement here is a simple and profound one:  with this novel, the legacy of a true master continues to shine forth in all its multifaceted glory.  And someone somewhere will read this novel, turn the last page, and in a great aura of awe and inspiration, come to a realization:I want to try to write stories like that.And they will.",
        "0060887184": "Bestseller Cornwell leaps back a millennium from his Richard Sharpe series to tell of the consolidation of England in the late ninth century and the role played by a young (fictional) warrior-in-training who's at the center of the war between Christian Englishmen and the pagan Danes. (Most of the other principal characters&mdash;Ubba, Guthrum, Ivar the Boneless and the like&mdash;are real historical figures.) Young Uhtred, who's English, falls under the control of Viking &uuml;ber-warrior Ragnar the Fearless when the Dane wipes out Uhtred's Northumberland family. Cornwell liberally feeds readers history and nuggets of battle data and customs, with Uhtred's first-person wonderment spinning all into a colorful journey of (self-)discovery. In a series of episodes, Ragnar conquers three of England's four kingdoms. The juiciest segment has King Edmund of East Anglia rebuking the Viking pagans and demanding that they convert to Christianity if they intend to remain in England. After Edmund cites the example of St. Sebastian, the Danes oblige him by turning him into a latter-day Sebastian and sending him off to heaven. Uhtred's affection for Ragnar as a surrogate father grows, and he surpasses the conqueror's blood sons in valor. When father and adopted son arrive at the fourth and last kingdom, however, the Danes meet unexpected resistance and Uhtred faces personal and familial challenges, as well as a crisis of national allegiance. This is a solid adventure by a crackling good storyteller.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0062021877": "InBlindsighted(book one of an anticipated three featuring Grant  County, Georgia, pediatrician and coroner Dr. Sara Linton), first-time novelist  Karin Slaughter comes out swinging in true medical examiner fashion. That is to  say, covered with blood from the get-go.Without warning, the body jerked violently, pitching forward and slamming Sara  onto the floor. Blood spread out around both of them, and Sara instinctively  clawed to get out from under the convulsing woman. With her feet and hands she  groped for some kind of purchase on the slick bathroom floor. Finally, Sara  managed to slide out from underneath her. She turned Sibyl over, cradling her  head, trying to help her through the convulsions. Suddenly, the jerking stopped.Sibyl is, or was, Sibyl Adams, a college professor who had the misfortune of  being drugged, savagely raped, slashed, and left for dead in the toilet of the  local diner, to be coincidentally discovered by Sara Linton. Coincidences don't  stop there, and neither do the rapes and murders. The next is, unimaginably,  still more gruesome than the first and it, too, is discovered by Dr. Linton.  Police Chief Jeffrey Tolliver is Sara's ex-husband, and mercurial detective Lena  Adams, another major player in the ensuing drama, was Sibyl's twin sister.And the monster behind these increasingly more depraved acts? Suspects abound,  from the diner's jack-of-all-trades, Will Harris, to Victim No. 2's boyfriend,  to Jack Allen Wright who, a dozen years prior, raped Dr. Linton (that rape had  been a secret until now). There are other possibilities, naturally, and it soon  becomes apparent that Sara's an intended target.A graduate of the Patricia Cornwell school of mayhem and gore, Slaughter has  faithfully stitched together a fast, engaging, and diverting read complete with  a strong-yet-vulnerable heroine. Characters are nicely if somewhat obviously  drawn, the plot is inventive, and the narrative's pacing quickens the pulse  straight to the cliff-hanging denouement.

Emma Cunningham, a widow with two teenage daughters, becomes financially and emotionally involved with Harvey Burdell, a wealthy dentist and land speculator. Without witnesses, he is murdered brutally in their Bond Street townhouse, and Cunningham is accused of the crime. An ambitious lawyer, Henry Clinton, risks his reputation and livelihood to defend her and solve the crime. Meanwhile, Horan describes living conditions in mid-nineteenth-century Manhattan: government corruption is rampant, Tammany Hall is coming to power, the Fugitive Slave Acts threaten to undo the work of the Underground Railroad, and poverty and wealth run equally rampant. Horan&#x2019;s characters, like Edith Wharton&#x2019;s, are motivated by social class and survival in a world ruled by wealth and national uncertainty.

Liv is dead and Aria's recovering from a disabling gunshot wound. Roar and Perry blame each other for Liv's death and it's tearing them apart. The magnetic Aether storms are getting worse. Before it's too late, they must find the Still Blue, a paradise where they can live safe from the storms. Sable, the ruthless and cruel Horn tribe leader, kidnaps Cinder to use his ability to generate an Aether to destroy the Aether currents. Perry, Aria, and the others determine to rescue Cinder, knowing that a showdown between rival tribe leaders Sable and Hess, the cowardly Dweller leader, is inevitable. Perry and Aria are strong yet imperfect characters struggling to balance their love for each other with their responsibilities as tribe leaders. Some of the book's most interesting characters, such as Liv and Cinder, aren't fully developed and are, sadly, short-lived. The inclusion of the identity of Aria's father, while not essential to the story, is a nice surprise. The humorous quips made by Roar and the 6, so welcome in the series' previous books, are largely missing here. The fact that Perry, Aria, and company are repeatedly captured by Sable does become a bit repetitive. Still, the forthright and compelling plot has just enough of a twist to make this book, and the series, stand out from others like it. Fans will be desperate to find out how it all ends.&#x2014;Sharon Rawlins, New Jersey State Library, Trenton",
        "0007230206": "Amazon Best of the Month, October 2009:No character in the canon has been writ larger than Henry VIII, but that didn't stop Hilary Mantel. She strides through centuries, past acres of novels, histories, biographies, and plays--even past Henry himself--confident in the knowledge that to recast history's most mercurial sovereign, it's not the King she needs to see, but one of the King's most mysterious agents. Enter Thomas Cromwell, a self-made man and remarkable polymath who ascends to the King's right hand. Rigorously pragmatic and forward-thinking, Cromwell has little interest in what motivates his Majesty, and although he makes way for Henry's marriage to the infamous Anne Boleyn, it's the future of a free England that he honors above all else and hopes to secure. Mantel plots with a sleight of hand, making full use of her masterful grasp on the facts without weighing down her prose. The opening cast of characters and family trees may give initial pause to some readers, but persevere: the witty, whip-smart lines volleying the action forward may convince you a short stay in the Tower of London might not be so bad... provided you could bring a copy ofWolf Hallalong. --Anne Bartholomew--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",
        "B0001VGFK2": "It may not be a splashy leap forward, but Rockstar Games'Grand Theft Auto: San Andreasin its own deep, dark way does just as much to move and revolutionize video games as its two predecessors,Grand Theft Auto IIIandGrand Theft Auto: Vice City. As in previous installments, here you play as a thug with problems you must steal and shoot your way out of, but the problems this time are disconcertingly more realistic. You play as Carl Johnson, known on the street as CJ, a likeable criminal type who has just returned to his hometown, Los Santos (a fictionalized Los Angeles), to find that his mother has been murdered and that the police have framed him for another murder. Reunions with his friends and a troubled relationship with his brother set off a sprawling, complex plot line, taking place at first in the immediate Los Santos area but eventually spilling into San Fierro (based on San Francisco) and Las Venturas (Las Vegas).You play as Carl Johnson, known on the street as CJ.This is an honest effort to create an engaging story about sympathetic characters caught up in a brutal environment that is on par with a movie or novel.Gaming GangstersWhereVice Citytook its cues, with tongue firmly in cheek, from the 1980s television seriesMiami Vice,San Andreasis a sincere homage to early 1990s innercity gangster films likeMenace 2 SocietyandBoyz &#x91;N the Hood. This is an honest effort to create an engaging story about sympathetic characters caught up in a brutal environment that is on par with a movie or novel. If that effort hits a few flat notes (you would have to be totally desensitized not to wonder if it's OK to make entertainment out of driveby shootings), it may also mark the first step toward video games growing up.  The first thing that fans of earlierGTAgames will notice is the range of action is much wider now: Along with shooting, running, and driving, there's now swimming, eating, working out, shopping, and, yes, getting a haircut. All this means the game has a fairly steep learning curve. But, though the pick-up-and-play appeal ofGrand Theft Auto IIImay be long gone, your access to the action becomes fairly transparent after a little practice. My only serious complaint is that, with the controller now crowded with such previously unheard-of functions like \"Gang Active\" and \"Talk Positive,\" you can drive only with the left analog stick. A minor point, but it makes cars a lot more difficult to handle.Bicycles take on a surprisingly central role.Vehicular VarietyIt would be hard to surpass the variety of automobiles available in earlier games, andSan Andreaswisely does not for the most part try to compete on that score. Instead, it's bicycles of all things that steal the show. The bikes' speed and flexibility are perfect for many of the missions, and there is something about cruising through the streets and basketball courts on a BMX that just feels right. If you play far enough into the game, you will also be rewarded with the chance to fly a number of aircraft, and flying is something Rockstar makes a greater effort to get right this time (welcome news for anyone who struggled with the planes and &#x91;copters of the earlier games).Lackluster Graphics--but a Real FeelGraphics--never a huge priority for Rockstar--actually take a step backward from the luscious, tropical look ofVice City. Textures are rendered with only a cursory attention to detail, and contours are often blocky. It scarcely matters, though, because no matter howSan Andreaslooks, itfeelsreal. This is due in no small part to voice work by an all-star cast including Samuel L. Jackson, Ice T, James Woods, Peter Fonda, and Outkast's Big Boy and a stellar soundtrack with tunes by Soundgarden, 2Pac, Public Enemy, and even a few country classics from the likes of Willie Nelson. But it's not just realistic,San Andreasis also vast, encompassing three big urban centers and huge swaths of rural land (complete with shotgun-toting farmers) between them. This vastness does mean, however, that there can be a lot of tedious driving to get to the missions, which, along with some awkward sequencing of the cut scenes (they are in places stacked one on top of the other), means that there is a bit too much downtime.  But never mind the quibbles.

Bryson's curiosity serves him well, as he delves into subjects as diverse as the reliability of the extant images of Shakespeare, a brief history of the theater in England and the continuing debates about whether William Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon really wrote Shakespeare's works.

She'd come to terms with the fact that the home was obviously not your run-of-the-mill state facility, or she wouldn't have discovered her powers as a necromancer or found the witch, Tori; the warlock, Simon; and the werewolf, Derek, also in residence. Now the four of them and the ghost of the recently deceased telekinetic Liz, are trying to find the one adult who can help them. Things are complicated by Simon's diabetes, Derek's imminent transformation, and Tori, who, despite her magical powers, is best described by a different word, which rhymes with witch. Armstrong does an admirable job of walking the fine line between making things too easy for the group and putting unnecessary obstacles in their path. Separating them from the adults, she delves into character and relationships among the teens, giving this title a depth that some supernatural fare lacks.

        "0061256803": "In his latest effort, Pearlman (The Bad Guys Won!) tells the story of how the Dallas Cowboys went from being a league doormat to a Super Bowl&ndash;winning machine. It's the cast of characters that makes this story a page-turner, starting with controlling owner Jerry Jones; all-business coach Jimmy Johnson, who would cut a player without blinking; and star players Troy Aikman, Michael Irvin, Emmitt Smith and Deion Sanders. Pearlman explores the many other people who bought into the philosophy that if you were going to be a Dallas Cowboy... you needed to live the life&mdash;and that meant, in the early '90s, plenty of infidelity, cocaine, nightly trips to gentleman's clubs and hangovers at practice. Pearlman interviewed nearly 150 members of the Cowboys organization for the book, but much of the terrific detail comes from such tangential folks as journalists, players' wives and staff at the local Cowboys restaurant. The anecdotes range from uplifting (the heartwarming story of quarterback Troy Aikman granting a wish to a dying boy) to raunchy (defensive end Chris Haley, while playing for the 49ers, often masturbated in the locker room). In the end, Pearlman has produced a narrative that is as entertaining as it is insightful.(Sept.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

        "0006550436": "At the beginning of Amy Tan's fourth novel, two packets of papers written in Chinese calligraphy fall into the hands of Ruth Young. One bundle is titledThings I Know Are Trueand the other,Things I Must Not Forget. The author? That would be the protagonist's mother, LuLing, who has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. In these documents the elderly matriarch, born in China in 1916, has set down a record of her birth and family history, determined to keep the facts from vanishing as her mind deteriorates.A San Francisco career woman who makes her living by ghostwriting self-help books, Ruth has little idea of her mother's past or true identity. What's more, their relationship has tended to be an angry one. Still, Ruth recognizes the onset of LuLing's decline--along with her own remorse over past rancor--and hires a translator to decipher the packets. She also resolves to \"ask her mother to tell her about her life. For once, she would ask. She would listen. She would sit down and not be in a hurry or have anything else to do.\"Framed at either end by Ruth's chapters, the central portion ofThe Bonesetter's Daughtertakes place in China in the remote, mountainous region where anthropologists discovered Peking Man in the 1920s. Here superstition and tradition rule over a succession of tiny villages. And here LuLing grows up under the watchful eye of her hideously scarred nursemaid, Precious Auntie. As she makes clear, it's not an enviable setting:I noticed the ripe stench of a pig pasture, the pockmarked land dug up by dragon-bone dream-seekers, the holes in the walls, the mud by the wells, the dustiness of the unpaved roads. I saw how all the women we passed, young and old, had the same bland face, sleepy eyes that were mirrors of their sleepy minds.Nor is rural isolation the worst of it. LuLing's family, a clan of ink makers, believes itself cursed by its connection to a local doctor, who cooks up his potions and remedies from human bones. And indeed, a great deal of bad luck befalls the narrator and her sister GaoLing before they can finally engineer their escape from China. Along the way, familial squabbles erupt around every corner, particularly among mothers, daughters, and sisters. And as she did in her earlierThe Joy Luck Club, Amy Tan uses these conflicts to explore the intricate dynamic that exists between first-generation Americans and their immigrant elders.--Victoria Jenkins--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

This time philosophical serial killer Serge is working for his Hammett-channeling friend Mahoney to track the worst offenders in an epidemic of scam artistry. Harnessing the power of metadata (no one said this book isn&#x2019;t smart), Serge and Coleman uncover a dazzling string of culprits.

        "0064401324": "Grade 3-6-Two delightful short books by John Reynolds Gardiner have been paired up in this audio set. Stone Fox (HarperCollins, 1980) tells the story of a boy determined to win a dog sled race to save his grandfather's farm. No one has ever beaten Stone Fox, an imposing and silent Native American, but little Willy trains daily for the race with his beloved dog, Searchlight. It seems like Willy might even win the race until heartbreaking tragedy strikes. Top Secret (Little, 1984) also features a determined boy and his grandfather, but in a much different setting and story. Allen Brewster has a fantastic idea that might even win the silver trophy at the science fair human photosynthesis. He has several obstacles to overcome. Allen persists in his mission using the scientific method and finally comes up with a concoction that turns him into a human plant. He turns green, craves sunlight and water instead of food, and sprouts baby roots if he stands in mud too long. Everything changes when Allen is deemed a threat to national security and his project is suddenly top secret. Both books are about 20 years old, so the characters do not represent very diverse backgrounds, but the messages of loyalty and determination are timeless. Tony Award winner B. D. Wong narrates the characters to fit the emotion and suspense of each story. The fact that one sentence was left out of the narration of Stone Fox and a few words were dropped from Top Secret might deter purchase of this audiobook for a read-along program.

After rescuing Yellowfang, ex-medicine cat for the ShadowClan who has fled for her life, Firepaw and the other ThunderClan members find themselves in the middle of a turf war against the rival gang, led by the nefarious Brokenstar.

The difficult life of a feral cat is described in some detail, and a fair amount of violence is included. The ending is left ambiguous-there is definitely more to come.

For company Henry has his long-divorced mother, Adele&#8212;a onetime dancer whose summer project was to teach him how to foxtrot; his hamster, Joe; and awkward Saturday-night outings to Friendly's with his estranged father and new stepfamily. As much as he tries, Henry knows that even with his jokes and his \"Husband for a Day\" coupon, he still can't make his emotionally fragile mother happy. Adele has a secret that makes it hard for her to leave their house, and seems to possess an irreparably broken heart.But all that changes on the Thursday before Labor Day, when a mysterious bleeding man named Frank approaches Henry and asks for a hand. Over the next five days, Henry will learn some of life's most valuable lessons: how to throw a baseball, the secret to perfect piecrust, the breathless pain of jealousy, the power of betrayal, and the importance of putting others&#8212;especially those we love&#8212;above ourselves. And the knowledge that real love is worth waiting for.In a manner evoking Ian McEwan'sAtonementand Nick Hornby'sAbout a Boy, acclaimed author Joyce Maynard weaves a beautiful, poignant tale of love, sex, adolescence, and devastating treachery as seen through the eyes of a young teenage boy&#8212;and the man he later becomes&#8212;looking back at an unexpected encounter that begins one single long, hot, life-altering weekend.The Obsessions BehindLabor Day: An Essay by Joyce MaynardI always tell students, when I teach writing, to locate their obsessions, and look to them when they&#x2019;re searching for the story they should be telling. When a writer attaches her work to the engine of what she cares about most passionately (even irrationally, perhaps) the work will be infused with a similar passion, I believe. And come into being most organically.This new novel of mine--though it&#x2019;s a product of my imagination, not my experience--contains elements of so many of my deepest obsessions. I think that&#x2019;s why I wrote it so easily and swiftly--almost as if I were transcribing a story being dictated to me from inside my brain.Anyone who has read my work for a while can recognize a few obvious connections to my history, starting with the experience of having been, for many years, a single parent of sons (also a daughter) living in a small town not unlike the imaginary town in which I located the novel. I like to think I have a somewhat more stable and grounded hold on reality and life in the world than Adele (and I am, if anything, the opposite of agoraphobic). But I share a number of her attributes: For starters, there&#x2019;s a hugely romantic nature and a love of dancing (though not her abilities on the dance floor; that part is the stuff of fantasy.) On a deeper level, though, I understand well the sorrow and regret a woman feels when the dream of family life as she envisioned it has left her. My sons--though I like to think they would weigh in with more positive feelings about their growing up years than negative ones--could certainly identify with the feelings Henry has, of undue responsibility for his mother. (Henry&#x2019;s innocent gift, to Adele, of the Husband-for-a-Day coupon was inspired by a similar gift presented to me one Christmas by my son Charlie, when he was around nine or ten.)I am always interested--no, fascinated--by children&#x2019;s perceptions of the adults in their world. The mysterious subject of sex, the first discovery of one&#x2019;s own sexuality, and the disquieting experience-- for a child of divorced parents in particular--of witnessing a parent&#x2019;s sexuality even as they embark on their own sexual lives. Complicated enough, when a child is contemplating the idea of his parents together--but the experience for a young person (a boy in particular) of seeing his mother with some other man is one I have thought about for a long time. (Ever since my son Willy--then age seven--responded to my going out on a date for the first time, after separating from his father, by taking a kitchen knife and plunging it directly into the crotch of a cardboard effigy of the country singer Randy Travis that I had propped up in our front hall . . . Willy is now 24 by the way. A very healthy person who displays no signs of being a psychopath.)Back to the obsession list. My experience of having gone through a painful custody battle many years ago--and the horrifying experience of being evaluated as a mother by a guardian ad litem--is in there. My history as a teenage girl with eating disorders also surfaced in this story, along with the guilt I carry about a betrayal I committed--at around that time in life--of a classmate&#x2019;s trust in me, when around age fourteen--an event that formed the basis for the first story I ever published in a magazine (Seventeen), somewhere around 1970 . . .Another experience that found its way into this novel (and one I also wrote about, in non-fiction form, a few years back) was a kind of fantasy love affair I found myself in, when I was myself a young and very lonely single mother, living in a small New Hampshire town with my three young children, and I got a letter (first one, then a hundred more) from a man in prison, who seemed to know and understand me better than anyone else. (I eventually learned--when it appeared he was getting out of prison and coming to visit my children and me--that this man was a double murderer. I first told the story at The Moth in New York, and later wrote it in an essay that appeared in Vogue, and in a collection published a few years back, calledMr. Wrong.)I will add here, that this is the third time in which I have chosen, for the central character of a novel of mine, a character who is thirteen years old. This is clearly an age that means a lot to me, and though I haven&#x2019;t been thirteen for many decades, I still feel very connected to that time of life.One odd little obsession that I included in the novel, with particular pleasure, concerns pie. Ever since the death of my mother, nineteen years ago, I have set myself the task of teaching pie-making to anyone I encounter who expresses frustration with making good crust--and the numbers of my past students have long since entered the triple digits. (I have also often run large gatherings of pie students at my home, to raise money for my political candidate. Always a Democrat . . .) I could talk a lot about what this pie exercise means to me--certainly it has to do with my mother, but also with honoring the old ways of doing things by hand, and paying attention to instinct (more than a recipe). And I have to add, I love it that I was able to include, in a work of fiction, instructions for making a pie crust that really will result in a good pie, if followed.The final obsession I will mention here--and it is the one that inspired my first novel,Baby Love, twenty-eight years ago--is babies. Although I am very different from Adele in many ways, the way she feels about having a baby is how I felt all my life. And what Frank says concerning the importance of paying attention to babies--and later, his thoughts are echoed by Henry, when he becomes a parent of a daughter--is everything I believe, myself. I have never met a baby I didn&#x2019;t like, or a crying baby I didn&#x2019;t feel I could bring to a state of calm. I just like babies a whole lot, and loved writing about that part here.I want to add: I did not intentionally set out to address any of these topics. They just came out, because they&#x2019;re all the things that interest me most. No doubt this is why I loved writing this novel and wrote it so fast. (I could not stop writing.) I wanted to read it.",

You just pray like hell they come when you need them!For me, this is the hardest and most stressful hurdle in what I do. The writing comes easy! For my last three books, I took conspiratorial headlines from the news&mdash;Iraq War scandals; people who used 9/11 to disappear from their life; the Wall Street financial meltdown&mdash;and wrapped them around more local and personal stories: a harrowing home invasion gone tragically wrong or a wife who wakes up one day to find her dead husband wasn't at all the person she thought she knew. Stories that I thought could achieve the emotional resonance I strive for in my books.Eyes Wide Opentook shape from two real life events straight from my own past. One was the sad suicide of my young nephew, a troubled kid, who was found at the bottom of a landmark cliff in central California. The second was a chance encounter forty years ago with none other than, ahem, Charles Manson! You&rsquo;ll have to read it to see how these stories link.Blind Curve, the book I&rsquo;m working on now, sprang from a crazy incident that happened to me last year while on my book tour. I was pulled out of my car for a minor traffic violation&mdash;an incident that escalated into my being thrown into cuffs and told I was going to jail. Except in my story, the hero doesn't get off as easily as I did.As long as events like these keep happening to me, I&rsquo;ll be in good shape!LG:Your last novel,Reckless, was a &ldquo;ripped from the headlines&rdquo; sort of novel, whereasEyes Wide Opendraws from events in your life. What prompted you to pull from your personal experiences this time around, and how hard was that to write?AG:It's much, much, much harder to write a story from your own life that affects real people, and some of them people you care for&mdash;especially those who have suffered tragedy, like me brother. On the other hand, drawing from personal experience makes for a much more enriching and rewarding story, one that is filled with the detail and resonance of real life. I wanted to write a poignant, personal testament to my nephew that was also a thriller, using a theme I seem to carry from book to book&mdash;a family hiding a secret past; in this case, revolving around teenage suicide, sons fighting against their fathers, the L.A. music scene in the &rsquo;60s, and an encounter with that Manson-like figure. Hopefully what came out is a chilling, rich, autobiographical, and satisfying tale filled with the kind of richness and family lore that you usually find in a memoir. While writingEyes Wide Openfrom events in my own life was tough, and awkward&mdash;and you know you may not please everyone&mdash;to me, it became more rewarding in the end.LG:OK, so you mentioned that as a child you had a passing encounter with Charles Manson, which helped inspireEyes Wide Open. Say what?AG:Okay. I go back and forth on this.Eyes Wide Openisn't a book about Manson, or even a Manson-like character, though a cultish figure is a chilling detail in the book. My dad moved out to L.A. in the &rsquo;60s and my older brother, a wayward spirit trying to become a musician, was out there as well, and, uh, took up residence on the Spahn Ranch, where Manson lived. At that time, Charlie was also trying to get his music produced. The two of them came up to my father's place one day and tried to sell him on anteing up for a demo. Manson was gaunt, quiet, creepy&mdash;and yes, he had those dark eyes. Though, at that time, Charlie Manson hadn't become the infamous &ldquo;Charles Manson&rdquo; yet! The scene eventually turned ugly&mdash;which I describe in the book&mdash;and they left, humiliated and angry. For years, my dad always insisted that the clan went up into the canyons that night looking to pay him back for what took place, but got lost in the L.A. hills and ended up at Sharon Tate&rsquo;s. Truth was, by that time my brother was long gone and, of course, there were other reasons the Manson clan ended up at Sharon Tate&rsquo;s house. But it makes a chilling scene!LG:Having followed your novels sinceThe Dark Tide, I&rsquo;ve noticed that you&rsquo;re drawn to stories involving complex family dynamics. What is it about this theme that resonates so strongly for you, and how has your own experience as a father influenced your writing?AG:I don't like writing straight-up thrillers. I like writing about families hurled into crisis and danger&mdash;soccer moms and regular dads and husbands who might have to rescue their daughters or who are, say, hedge fund managers and have one foot on the sidelines watching their kids and the other in nefarious cover-ups and conspiracies. These are the &ldquo;real life&rdquo; stories that intrigue me and provide the basis for the emotional complexity I&rsquo;m looking for. As for being a dad, it makes you know exactly what you would do&mdash;basically anything&mdash;to save your own family. And how creepy and evil one has to be to betray theirs!LG:One thriller writer to another, what draws you to suspense&mdash;and what&rsquo;s your favorite thing about thrillers?AG:You know what, Lisa, you can make a strong case that thriller writing is the single most relevant genre of fiction being written today, because it reflects the conflicts and crises and stories that we read every day in the news and that shape our world. The people who come to our craft aren&rsquo;t just graduate students, or MFA candidates or teachers, but CIA agents and journalists and doctors and lawyers whose experiences in life inform their work. As for suspense, I like to write books that draw you into the hero&rsquo;s plight from the opening pages, where people put their lives on the line for something&mdash;a belief, a family member, the truth. I&rsquo;m actually more into heroism than evil&mdash;but it's hard to have one without the other and when their arcs meet and they clash... well, there's suspense!LG:Without giving too much away, what&rsquo;s your favorite scene inEyes Wide Open?AG:Well, there are many, because the characters are based on people I know. But without doubt, one of the best involves my everyman hero, Jay Erlich, a doctor from Westchester who puts his successful life on hold and his life on the line to find the truth behind his nephew's suicide. Erlich goes to the super-max Pelican Bay Prison to see the long incarcerated Manson-like murderer, Russell Hovnanian. And the thing that makes that scene really creepy, and made hard to write, was that to be credible, this character, Hovnanian, had to be smarter than my hero, smarter than the very smart detective who accompanies him, even smarter than the reader! Oh yeah, the author too. But when it's pulled off, as I hope I did, it's a killer scene.LG:You wrote sixNew York Timesbestsellers with James Patterson. Dish. What was it like to work with Jim, and how much more fun is it to control everything yourself?AG:Such good questions. Are you a writer, too? Oh, wait.  Never mind.Ha! Jim and I got along fine; he's an amazing idea guy, his instincts for plot are finely honed, and I think he might even say himself that he's a sharper editor than a writer. I always describe working with him as an MFA and MBA course in thriller management rolled into one. I learned a lot of things about how to craft a thriller that would have taken years to learn on my own&mdash;and how to put them in my own style. I&rsquo;m honestly proud of the six books we did together, all of which went to number one. But yes, I&rsquo;m kind of a control guy&mdash;how did you know?To his credit, Jim let me have a substantial share of control on the books we did&mdash;probably a lot more than I would have. He&rsquo;s a much more evolved manager than me! And all these books later, I still kind of miss him, calling him up, running a plot idea by him. I mean, is there a better person in the world to bounce an idea off of? But I also like it when the checks are made out solely to me!LG:Now tell me the truth. What is your least favorite part of writing&mdash;and you can only choose one.AG:Easy&mdash;this is becoming a bit of a running theme here&mdash;loss of control! You shape your baby from the initial birth of an idea, live with it daily, watch it grow like a child into a fully dimensional being. You feel you know it better than anybody. Then you turn it over and put it out into the world and between the cover, the marketing, the presentation at retail and the sales, it all takes place without you being able to control its destiny a single lick! And by that time, you're already halfway into the next one anyway!LG:Finally, what do you want readers to take away from readingEyes Wide Open&mdash;and congrats on another great novel!AG:Thanks, Lisa. What I would have them take away is thatEyes Wide Openis not only a thrilling read, it's also an engrossing, emotional family story&mdash;about a family with a dark history and the lengths it will go to protect that secret. It&rsquo;s also about two brothers, one wayward, the other successful, and how they try to bridge the gap that tore them apart. It reads like a personal memoir chock-full of thrills. And it&rsquo;s my family story.So great to be with you today! I was a big fan ofLove You More. It&rsquo;s been a lot of fun!",

        "0060584750": "Ever since blasting onto the literary scene with the Shamus Award-winningA Drink Before the War, Dennis Lehane has been the golden boy of noir. His Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro novels are marvels of tight pacing, dialogue so good it gets under your skin and stays there, with dead-on portrayals of working-class Boston neighborhoods. Sure, he's the oft-proclaimed, hard-boiled heir to Hammett and Chandler, but Lehane also takes a page from the Hemingway school of hyper-intense writing. He pares away and pares away until he's left with the absolute essentials--and then those essentials just explode off the page.In his five Kenzie-Gennaro novels, the detective duo is at the nexus of Lehane's  big bang. Darkly funny and just this side of jaded, Angie and Patrick move  through Dorchester's bleak streets with an assurance born of familiarity. It's  impossible to imagine these streets without the pair, or to imagine the pair  away from those streets.Mystic River, then, arrives as a bit of a  gamble, as Lehane moves from the sharp edges of portraiture to the broader  strokes of landscape. No Angie, no Patrick: this neighborhood is on its own.  It's not any prettier and certainly no friendlier, and its working-class  fa&ccedil;ade still barely masks the irresistible tug of violent ways, means,  and ends.Twenty-five years ago, Dave Boyle got into a car. When he came back four days  later, he was different in a way that destroyed his friendship with Sean Devine  and Jimmy Marcus. Now Sean's a cop, Jimmy's a store owner with a prison record  and mob connections, and Dave's trying hard to keep his demons safely submerged.  When Jimmy's daughter Katie is found murdered, each of the men must confront a  past that none is eager to acknowledge. Lehane tugs delicately on the strands  that weave this neighborhood together, testing for their strengths and  weaknesses; this novel seems as much anthropological case study as thriller.By turns violent and pensive,Mystic Riveris vintage Lehane. How good is  it? You may go in missing Angie and Patrick, but after a few pages you won't  even realize they're gone. Lehane's noir is still black magic.--Kelly  Flynn--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

        "0091800951": "Bestselling British author Harris (Pompeii;Enigma) returns to ancient Rome for this entertaining and enlightening novel of Marcus Cicero's rise to power. Narrated by a household slave named Tiro, who actually served as Cicero's \"confidential secretary\" for 36 years, this fictional biography follows the statesman and orator from his early career as an outsider&mdash;a \"new man\" from the provinces&mdash;to his election to the consulship, Rome's highest office, in 64 B.C. Loathed by the aristocrats, Cicero lived by his wits in a tireless quest for imperium&mdash;the ultimate power of life and death&mdash;and achieves \"his life's ambition\" after uncovering a plot by Marcus Crassus and Julius Caesar to rig the elections and seize control of the government. Harris's description of Rome's labyrinthine, and sometimes deadly, political scene is fascinating and instructive. The action is relentless, and readers will be disappointed when Harris leaves Cicero at the moment of his greatest triumph. Given Cicero's stormy consulship, his continuing opposition to Julius Caesar and his own assassination, readers can only hope a sequel is in the works.

        "0061148717": "The lives of Ulysses S. Grant and William T. Sherman are classic underdog stories. Both of these \"obscure failures\" experienced more disappointment than success prior to the start of the Civil War. By 1861, they had each resigned from the U.S. Army and failed in several civilian pursuits between them, including farming, real estate, retail, and banking. Further, Grant was known as a drunk and Sherman was labeled insane. But once they threw themselves into the war effort, their best traits and talents began to reveal themselves. Even their motives were similar--both men joined the war not to eradicate slavery but to hold the Union together, believing that secession was equal to treason. This dual biography gracefully reveals how the two men grew to be \"as brothers,\" why their partnership proved essential to victory for the Union, and how well they complemented and helped each other in their lives and careers, despite some major differences. For instance, though he possessed tremendous talent, Sherman was insecure and initially asked Abraham Lincoln never to give him a superior command. Grant, on the other hand, never doubted his ability to lead, and he quickly, if quietly, moved up the chain of command. Once he recognized Sherman's abilities, Grant made sure to keep him close, and they grew to depend upon each other completely. Through their near-daily interaction, even when separated by distance, both men honed their skills and eventually came up with a winning strategy for the war, which they executed in a brilliant two-pronged assault.The book also discusses Grant's and Sherman's marriages, their relationships with their soldiers, and their dealings with politicians to provide well-rounded and complete portraits of these fascinating leaders.Grant and Shermanis a thoughtful portrait of the two men who \"other than Lincoln... would have more to do with winning the war that preserved the Union than anyone else.\" --Shawn Carkonen--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

Transformed into a night creature when she was a child, Destiny is unlike any of Feehan's previous heroines. Her physical strength is equal to that of her Carpathian counterpart, Nicolae Von Shrieder, but she's horrified by what she is and haunted by memories of her parents' brutal murder. Nicolae merged his mind with hers when she was first transformed, and through their mental connection, he taught her how to survive. Now Nicolae must find Destiny and make her his lifemate, or he will succumb to darkness and become a vampire. Feehan's protagonists and prose can be overwrought (\"His body was hard and full, aching for her.... and deep within, the crouching beast lifted its head and roared for release\"), and inconsistencies litter the text (Destiny can supposedly read Nicolae's mind, but it takes her eons to trust him and stop threatening to kill him).

The unnamed narrator, a muddled freelance writer, is 34 and no closer to finding happiness than he was in the previous book. Divorced, bereaved and abandoned by his various lovers, he is drawn to the Dolphin Hotel--a strange and lonely establishment where Kiki, a woman he once lived with, \"upped and vanished.\" Kiki and the Sheep Man, an odd fellow who wears a sheepskin and speaks in a toneless rush, visit the narrator in visions that lead him to two mysteries, one metaphysical (how to survive the unsurvivable) and the other physical (a call girl's murder). In his searchings, he encounters a clairvoyant 13-year-old, her misguided parents and a one-armed poet. All the hallmarks of Murakami's greatness are here: restless and sensitive characters, disturbing shifts into altered reality, silky smooth turns of phrase and a narrative with all the momentum of a roller coaster.

But on the first day of school, Chrysanthemum begins to suspect that her name is far less than  perfect, especially when her class dissolves into giggles upon hearing her name read aloud. That evening,  Chrysanthemum's parents try to piece her self-esteem back together again with comfort food and a night  filled \"with hugs, kisses, and Parcheesi.\" But the next day Victoria, a particularly observant and mean-spirited classmate, announces that Chrysanthemum's name takes up 13 letters. \"That's half the letters in the  alphabet!\" she adds. Chrysanthemum wilts. Pretty soon the girls are making playground threats to \"pluck\" Chrysanthemum and \"smell her.\"Kevin Henkes has great compassion for the victims of childhood teasing and cruelties--using fresh language,  endearing pen-and-ink mouse characters, and realistic dialogue to portray real-life vulnerability. He also has  great compassion for parents, offering several adult-humor jokes for anxious mommies and daddies. On the  surface, the finale is overly tidy and the coincidences unbelievable.

Exchanging greetings with senators and other dignitaries, my heart should have been joyful; instead, I was stunned.  That morning&rsquo;sWashington Postheadline had read: &ldquo;Albright Family Tragedy Comes to Light.&rdquo;I was 59 when I learned from a reporter and from certain letters I had received that my ancestral heritage was Jewish and that more than two dozen of my relatives had died in the Holocaust.  The revelation shook my deeply ingrained sense of identity, and prompted me to seek answers to questions that I had never before thought to ask.  That search began with visits to the small towns in Czechoslovakia where my parents had grown up and to the ancient synagogue where the names of Holocaust victims are enshrined.Prague Winteris a continuation of that personal journey, but also a much wider tale concerning a generation compelled to make painful moral choices amid the tumult of war.In 1939, when efforts by British and French leaders to appease Hitler had backfired, the Nazis invaded my homeland.  I was not yet two years old.  My parents escaped with me to London where my father became head of broadcasting for the Czechoslovak government in exile.  Strangers in an embattled land, we endured along with our new neighbors the terrible bombing of the Blitz.  Back home, the German occupation quickly evolved into a reign of terror under the direction of Reinhard Heydrich, &ldquo;The Butcher of Prague.&rdquo;  As preparations were made to exterminate the country&rsquo;s Jews, Czechoslovak parachutists returned to their native soil with a mission: to kill Heydrich -- the only successful assassination of a senior Nazi during the war.  In the months that followed that daring assault, Czechs suffered from Hitler&rsquo;s vengeance, while Jews confined to the infamous Terezin ghetto struggled to retain hope despite overcrowded conditions and the periodic departure of fellow inmates on trains to the east.  In England, Czechoslovak leaders maneuvered to reclaim their country&rsquo;s independence; my mother and father agonized over the fate of loved ones who had remained behind.From the day America entered the war, my parents and their friends were confident the Allies would win. As democrats from Central Europe, they prayed that the United States&mdash;not the Soviet Union&mdash;would wield the decisive postwar influence in our region. It was not to be. When at last the Nazis were defeated, Czechoslovakia became again a battleground between democracy and totalitarianism; before long, my family was forced into exile for the second time, finding a permanent home in America.The story ofPrague Winteris often as intensely personal as a mother&rsquo;s letter, a father&rsquo;s hidden sorrow, and the earnest artwork of an imprisoned ten-year-old cousin.  The themes, however, are universal: loyalty and betrayal, respect and bigotry, accommodating evil or fighting back.  What fascinates me is why we make the choices we do. What prompts one person to act boldly in a moment of crisis and a second to seek shelter in the crowd? Why do some people become stronger in the face of adversity while others quickly lose heart?  What drives many of us to look down on neighbors based on the flimsy pretexts of nationality and creed?  Is it education, spiritual belief, parental guidance, traumatic events, or more likely some combination that causes us to follow the paths that we do?  My search for answers compelled me to look back&mdash;to the time of harshest winter in the city of my birth.",

While Tristan&#x2019;s good friend Douglas Bennet may allow his sister to run roughshod over his life, Tristan is not about to give up the delightful benefits of bachelorhood for a woman who will only stop talking when being kissed. As for Joan, she considers Tristan to be the most infuriating man in London. If he isn&#x2019;t questioning her fashion sense, he&#x2019;s interfering with what she reads. Between his constant intrusions into her life and his deliciously unforgettable kisses, it is enough to drive a lady simply mad. Linden, who racked up a well-deserved RITA Award last year for I Love the Earl (2011), soars to new heights of laughter-laced literary fun in the first in a new Regency-set series.

        "0062107313": "An Amazon Best Book of the Month, November 2013:For a hefty half of her gorgeous new novel,The Valley of Amazement, Amy Tan instructs us in the finer points of life as a courtesan in early 20th century China: expect and revel in sensual descriptions of  the clothes, the customs, even the  not-so-niceties of catering to rich men in a very regimented society. Lulu Minturn is a white Californian who&rsquo;d run away with a Chinese painter, established the best courtesan house in Shanghai and given birth to a beautiful &ldquo;Eurasian&rdquo; (in the parlance of the time) daughter, Violet. Soon, either because she was tricked or deceitful, Lulu abandons Violet and flees back to America; history soon is in danger of repeating itself when Violet gives birth to her own daughter. (Eventually, the scene shifts to California, where the family searches for redemption and reconciliation.) Nobody does mother-daughter angst and cross cultural conflict better than Tan, who has been literally writing the book(s) on these topics for years. What makes this novel special is its meticulous language--readers may be struck by the juxtaposition of poetry and Anglosaxon equivalents in descriptions of courtesans&rsquo; sex lives--and its elucidation of the cultural upheavals at the time. This is as much a historical novel as it is a family story, at once intimate and sweeping, personal and political. You&rsquo;ll have learned something by the end--and you&rsquo;ll probably also be weeping.  --Sara Nelson",
        "0061031127": "Set in her native St. Petersburg, Russia, Simons's latest thick novel (after Tully, etc.) focuses on a WWII love affair. As the story opens, Tatiana, the youngest member of the Metanova family, is just 17; she still shares a bed with her older sister, Dasha. Not long after the country goes to war with Germany, Tatiana meets Alexander, a soldier, and sparks fly. It turns out, however, that Alexander is the same soldier Dasha has been crowing about. Possessed of a strong sense of family loyalty, and living under conditions that permit no privacy, Tatiana refuses to interfere with her sister's happiness, but the attraction between Tatiana and Alexander proves too powerful. Complicating matters, another soldier, Dimitri, has information that could destroy Alexander, and Dimitri likes Tatiana, too. In order to protect both Dasha's feelings and Alexander's life, the star-crossed lovers become part of a deceptive quadrangle as war intensifies around them. Taking her title from a tragic poem by Alexandr Pushkin, Simons skillfully highlights the ironies of the socialist utopia. Despite the novel's sprawling length and its seemingly epic scope, the nearly single-minded focus on dialogue between Tatiana and Alexander leaves other character development shortchanged and the reader with the impression of a peculiarly tiny canvas. Nave and occupying the Cinderella role in her family, Tatiana is certainly a survivor though one who finally outstays her welcome. While her love story is often both tender and fierce, it is also overwrought and prolonged past the breaking point.

It certainly offers the same gripping cockpit view of modern air combat, in this case over Iraq in two wars and patrolling U.S. skies after 9/11. Hampton recounts his training as a pilot, then his selection for F-16s&#x2014;officially the Fighting Falcon but known in the USAF as the Viper&#x2014;and finally his training for the most demanding flying done in the F-16, the Wild Weasel missions. These missions are dedicated to the neutralization or, preferably, destruction of enemy air defenses and date back to the first encounters with SAMs, in the Vietnam War. As the radars and missiles on the ground have improved, so have the technology and skills of the Wild Weasel pilots, who must keep themselves and their comrades alive in an air full of high-tech hostility. Hampton is a vivid writer and an unabashed warrior, and, like most such, he has doubts about the future of American armed forces if they are to be commanded by men who are neither warriors themselves nor particularly empathetic toward those who are.

Link, the hero of the adventure games, delighted millions by starring in games for each Nintendo console from the NES and Super NES to the Nintendo 64. Link brings this beloved franchise to the Nintendo GameCube inThe Legend Of Zelda: The Wind Waker, and he's moreanimatedthan ever.The first thing you'll notice aboutThe Legend Of Zelda: The Wind Wakeris that it looks completely different from any previous title in the franchise. Nintendo has opted to use cel-shading technology onWind Waker; the result is that the game looks like a cartoon. Die-hard Zelda purists initially howled at this change, arguing that the game skews too young. I think it's fantastic. The cartoon animation style allows for better expression of the characters, and several of the animations--like Link trying to pick up an object that's too heavy--are so cute that you can't help but laugh a little.The second thing you&#x92;ll notice is a focus on wind. Instead of trotting around on foot, Link travels from island to island on a talking boat, but he doesn't get far without the wind blowing in right direction. Luckily, you'll learn how to change the direction of the wind early in the game, and you'll do so frequently--not only to power your boat but also to solve puzzles. Clever use of wind makesWind Wakerstand out from more conventional adventure games.The third thing you&#x92;ll notice is that the game is just plain fun. Puzzles are innovative and refreshing, and despite some tricky puzzles, I never felt too frustrated to keep playing. The locales you'll visit are invariably exotic and fun to explore, and the host of bizarre creatures you'll encounter (friendly and otherwise) are always a kick in the pants. Moreover, though the look is radically different,Wind Wakerfeels like a classic Zelda game. Veterans of the early games in the franchise will experience more than a bit of nostalgia while playing it.The Legend Of Zelda: The Wind Wakeris everything you've come to expect from a Zelda game, and it's one of the best adventure games to date.

Divorced from blue-blood architect Talmadge Evans III, but still living in a carriage house in the backyard of their restored mansion, Eloise \"Weezie\" Foley suffers the indignity of having her ex's sexy fianc&#x82;e, Caroline DeSantos, living in the main house Weezie restored herself. As a \"picker,\" Weezie earns her living foraging for discarded treasures in Dumpsters and at estate sales. When she discovers Caroline's corpse in a historic manor house, Weezie is the prime suspect in her murder. To compound her quandary, Weezie's attorney her closeted Uncle James, an ex-Catholic priest is having an illicit affair with a man from the DA's office. Factor in her on-again, off-again romance with old high school flame Daniel Stipanek, counterfeit antiques and her mom's alcoholism, and the plucky heroine has enough problems to drive at least three novels. Unfortunately, the suspense gets lost somewhere among the antiques and Weezie's attempts to consummate her romance with Daniel. But even a denouement that comes way too soon and a junk bin of distractions won't keep readers away. 8-city author tour.

At the start of L&auml;ckberg's haunting U.S. debut, the first of her seven novels set in the Swedish coastal town of Fj&auml;llbacka, biographer Erica Falck returns home to sort through her deceased parents' belongings and work on her next book. But this is not the same hometown she grew up in. Summer tourists are turning the former fishing village into a thriving resort, and Erica's controlling brother-in-law is pressuring her to cash in by selling the family home. The apparent suicide of childhood friend Alexandra Wijkner contributes to Erica's grief. Once inseparable, they drifted apart before Alex's family abruptly moved away, and Erica feels compelled to write a novel about why the beautiful Alex would kill herself.

The victim is a young woman, Rebecca Meredith, a detective with the Metropolitan Police, who had been undergoing a punishing training regimen in hopes of qualifying for the women&#x2019;s single scull event in the upcoming Olympics. The investigation is especially tricky because of Meredith&#x2019;s professional status.

An added shock is the attempted murder of one of the search-and-rescue team members who found Meredith&#x2019;s body.

The defeated, but not destroyed, DomDaniel is still bent on ruling the Castle as ExtraOrdinary Wizard by removing Jenna, the rightful heir to the throne. This time it's Simon Heap who, as the necromancer's new Apprentice, pursues Jenna through both new and familiar territory. Meanwhile, a sinister plot unfolds at the Castle to banish the current ExtraOrdinary Wizard, Marcia Overstrand, by means of a Darke Shadow that follows her around and grows ominously more visible by the day. Readers will find themselves quickly immersed in this imaginative world, moving from one well-crafted adventure to another at a suspenseful pace.

Brother Juniper wonders if the tragedy happened according to a divine plan or was simply a random instance of misfortune. His curiosity leads him to investigate the lives of the five victims to prove that the bridge collapse and the resulting deaths were indeed divine intervention&#x2014;that God intended for them to die then and there. But, of course, the point of the novel is that there is no commonality among them, other than the fact that they are all simply human, with their own frailties. Wilder ends his at-once urgent and serene novel with this haunting passage: &#x201C;But soon we shall die and all memory of these five will have left the earth, and we ourselves shall be loved for a while and forgotten. But the love will have been enough; all those impulses of love return to the love that made them. Even memory is not necessary for love.

It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect.

Marley was a sweet, affectionate puppy who grew into a lovably naughty, hyperactive dog. With a light touch, the author details how Marley was kicked out of obedience school after humiliating his instructor (whom Grogan calls Miss Dominatrix) and swallowed an 18-karat solid gold necklace (Grogan describes his gross but hilarious \"recovery operation\"). With the arrival of children in the family, Marley became so incorrigible that Jenny, stressed out by a new baby, ordered her husband to get rid of him; she eventually recovered her equilibrium and relented.

The people of Haven City have grown to distrust Jak's dark powers, and as rumors boil of Jak's ties with Krew and Kor, the city blames Jak for its current woeful circumstances. When the palace is destroyed by a surprise Metal Head attack, even Ashelin cannot protect Jak as the High Council's power broker, Count Veger, forces Jak into banishment to the desolate Wasteland.

A mid-career realization that she had lived without \"real inner authority\" and with \"a fear of dissension, confrontation, backlash, a fear of not pleasing, not living up to sanctioned models of femininity\" produced in Kidd the new mindset that made her journey possible. Additionally, her extensive knowledge of many subjects, including theology, mythology and the arts, made possible the copious references and cross-references that will prove invaluable for readers who wish to follow her in this same search. While Kidd cautions that each woman's path will be unique, there is no question but that many women will find in her book a mirror of their own present conditions and a hopeful call to self-discovery.Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.",
        "0062008048": "The gruesome murders of the beautiful and talented actress Sharon Tate, her unborn child and four others that same night at the hands of the notorious &#8220;Manson family&#8221; rocked the nation. As one of the most horrific crimes in modern history, these atrocities, the trial and the subsequent conviction of Charles Manson and his followers caused a media sensation, spawning movies, documentaries and bestselling books, including the classicHelter Skelter. A defining moment in an era otherwise associated with radical peace, love and understanding, this incident is one that still resonates with millions today.Yet while this crime left an indelible mark on society&#8217;s consciousness, it was, first and foremost, a shattering personal tragedy for those closest to Sharon&#8212;the loving family left to cope with the emotional devastation of her loss. Now, after nearly forty years, their story is finally revealed.Compiled by close family friend Alisa Statman and Sharon&#8217;s niece Brie Tate,Restless Soulsdraws on a wealth of material including interviews with the Tates, personal letters, tape recordings, home movies, public interviews, private journals, and official documents to provide a powerful, poignant, and affecting four-decade, three-generation memoir of crime and punishment, anguish and hope, rage and love, that is both a chronicle of death and a celebration of life.Extending beyond all previous accounts,Restless Soulsis the most revealing, riveting, and emotionally raw account not just of these heinous murders, the hunt and capture of the killers and the behind-the-scenes drama of their trials, but of the torment victims families&#8217; endure for years in the wake of such senseless violence.Tate family members set the record straight, correcting media misinformation and delving well beyond the official storyline to provide information, much of it available for the first time.

Alison efficiently handles the first two problems, hiring attorneys specializing in discrimination and divorce. With her supportive college student son, Chris, she heads for Sedona, Ariz., her hometown, to visit her sympathetic parents and await news of Reenie. When Chris sets up a blog for her, Alison, usually tense and judgmental, begins revealing herself to strangers, a practice that leads to a personal threat. After Reenie's body is found, the police pronounce her a suicide; Alison disagrees and begins to investigate her friend's life. The reader learns much about age and sex discrimination, spousal abuse, the effects of catastrophic illness on families and anonymous Internet communication.

When Kate's advances are rebuffed by the sexy man sitting next to her in a bar on Valentine's Day, she feels the sting of rejection&mdash;which is soon compounded by humiliation when she learns that the stranger is Rob Sutter, owner of the sporting goods store located next to her grandfather's grocery. Both Rob and Kate have skidded to a halt in Gospel&mdash;Kate after her work as a PI unwittingly armed a man with information to track down and kill his family, and Rob after his pro hockey career was derailed by a gun-toting psychopath. Instead of exploring this weighty material, Gibson focuses on such lighthearted frolics as whipped-cream fights in the aisles of Kate's grocery store. Because Rob remains literally and figuratively behind the wheel of his Hummer and Kate never fully faces her own demons, their romance lacks emotional heft. Gibson also portrays Gospel's elderly citizenry as cartoonish, rendering what could have been a poignant romance between Kate's grandfather and Rob's mother as condescendingly sweet. The novel begins and ends on Valentine's Day, and the rest of the story never transcends the holiday's reputation for false promises.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The game treats itself like a movie, with frequent dialogue and cinematics, a soundtrack filled with some of rap's heavy hitters, and some surprising voiceover talent, like Christopher Walken and Snoop Dogg.The missions given to you tend to involve shooting up or beating up (there is a big distinction between gun fighting and kung fu) a room full of bad guys, or simply have you racing against the clock in your car. In between, you can roam around and solve simple street crimes (mugging, car jackings, etc), or earn upgrades for your driving, shooting, and fighting abilities. The upgrade mechanism is important because while it's an entertaining way to add new gameplay elements several hours in, the early game leaves you with so few moves that the game is hard, or worse, boring. The game also features a Good-Cop/Bad-Cop karma system that rewards or punishes you for doing the right or wrong thing. Arrest criminals in non-lethal manner to get better endings, or terrorize the populace and have both citizens and police turn on you.While it can be an entertaining take on theGrand Theft Autogenre,True Crimetends to suffer from hit and miss execution. For every compelling game element, there's another equally awful one. There are several mission types that are completely devoid of any fun, melee fighting favors button mashing even after the nearly-useless string of upgrades, and the controls and camera seem to work against you more often than for you.

        "B00005B8G1": "The Game Boy platform (which includes the original unit, the Game Boy Pocket, and the Game Boy Color) came to market when most video game consoles had a life expectancy of just a few years. More than a decade later, the system is still going strong. How did the Game Boy successfully compete--and in some cases bury--an onslaught of faster, more powerful handheld and home console systems? Let us count the ways: affordability, a huge library of games that consistently made the most of the hardware's limitations, smart power management that extended battery life, and uncluttered controls. But perhaps it was the system's ultraportable design that allowed devotees to play video games around their schedule, making it the must-have system for kids and adults alike.Now the Game Boy Advance (or GBA as people are already calling it) comes to us with power that would have been unthinkable back in the day. The portable's 32-bit RISC CPU runs circles around the former's 8-bit workhorse, allowing it to process program instructions much faster. What that means to everyday gamers is more intricate visuals, more simultaneous movement on the screen, and better sound. In fact, the often-annoying beeps and boops of old-school Game Boy titles are being replaced with digitized stereo sound. The extra processing muscle also means you can even network up to four Game Boy Advance units together, via the communication cable, for multiplayer fun off of one shared cartridge. Only two Game Boy Color units could link together, and each unit had to have its own copy of the game.What's not being replaced, however, is the wide selection of Game Boy games. Because the Game Boy Advance system is backward-compatible, it will play its own line of colorful games--including such launch titles asSuper Mario Advance,F-Zero: Maximum Velocity,Army Men Advance,High Heat Major League Baseball 2002,Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, andReady 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2--as well as all of the monochrome and color games that have already been released for the previous Game Boy systems (nearly 500 in total). Players can view the older games in their smaller, originally square dimensions, or, with the touch of the shoulder button, expand the game to fit the GBA's larger screen. We tried enlarging the screen on a Game Boy Color edition ofTony Hawk's Pro Skater 2and found that Mr. Hawk was much easier to see.When you first pick up the system, you'll be amazed at how lightweight it is. At fewer than 5 ounces and a little larger than a deck of playing cards, the system easily fits into a shirt pocket without any sag. The GBA's wider shape fits better into a wider range of hands. The former design too often pushed the left and right thumb knuckles together during gameplay. The new layout should be comfortable for all ages, and the center screen orientation makes it easy to see.Game Boy Color owners will find the GBA's larger screen somewhat darker than they're used to, but that's because the screen is outfitted with antiglare technology. Like the old Game Boy Color, the color LCD is not backlit, so you need pretty good light to play by. Unlike that system, though, you won't be craning your neck and tilting the unit to see around the hot-spot reflection of the light bulb in your screen.But you'll also notice the graphics. Sporting what's basically a redesigned SNES technology, you'll see things on the GBA that the big consoles do, such as scaling (making objects larger or smaller) and rotation effects--technological advances that will affect the look of everything from crossing a finish line to throwing a touchdown pass to crawling through a dungeon.Some might argue that Nintendo could have tried to put even more power into this Game Boy Advance. After all, the 32-bit video game had its heyday more than five years ago. Perhaps, but after handling this new handheld, we're inclined to think that Nintendo wisely struck a balance between size, price, and power consumption. And considering how well the old 8-bit system weathered the decade's technological storms, we think the Game Boy Advance is here to stay, and we're glad.--Porter B.

Germany and the U.S., the world's two superpowers, find themselves in a cold war resulting from a nuclear stalemate; but U.S. President Joseph P. Kennedy is soon to visit Berlin for an historic summit meeting with Hitler, clearing the way for detente. Meanwhile, cynical police detective Xavier March investigates the drowning of Josef Buhler, former state secretary in the General Government. When the Gestapo takes over the case--ruling it suicide--March continues his investigation at the risk of his life, uncovering a deadly conspiracy at the highest levels of the Reich. With the help of American reporter Charlotte Maguire, he finds hard evidence of the wartime extermination of Europe's Jews, a secret that Buhler and his colleagues have been murdered to protect. Of course March and Maguire fall in love along the way. Harris ( Selling Hitler ) generates little suspense in this tale beyond his piecemeal rendering of the novel's unusual historical setting. The characters are flat and the plot largely predictable.

Yet the story of the post-breakup Beatles is intriguing and fascinating in its own right. Doggett begins at the end, with the 1980 murder of John Lennon outside the Dakota apartment building in New York, then turns back to the late-1960s, when Sgt. Pepper was released and the glow of the group&#x2019;s innocent days had long dimmed. In that tumultuous time, the foundation of the band&#x2019;s eventual demise several years later was laid. Doggett captures the competitive sparks that flew among the four men, especially between Lennon and Paul McCartney, and also the mutual affection that formed the basis of their complicated relationships. He covers all the many lawsuits and legal maneuverings that consumed so much of their time as well as the feelings of anger and betrayal and the weariness of it all. And he discusses each member&#x2019;s solo albums. A must for Beatles fans and good for more casual pop-music enthusiasts, too. --June Sawyers",

Things go from bad to worse when some of the children begin exhibiting strange powers, animals show signs of freakish mutations, and people disappear as soon as they turn 14. Though an excellent premise for a novel,Gonesuffers from a couple of problems. First, it is just too long. After opening with a bang, the initial 200 or so pages limp along before the action begins to really pick up. Secondly, based on the themes of violence, death, and implied sexual intimidation, this is clearly written for an older teen audience who may not appreciate the fact that no one in the book is older than 13.

And it is the 14th door that--sometimes blocked with a  wall of bricks--opens up for Coraline into an entirely alternate universe. Now,  if you're thinking fondly ofThe Lion, the Witch, and the WardrobeorAlice's Adventures in Wonderland, you're on the wrong track.

A distorted-mirror world, containing  presumably everything Coraline has ever dreamed of... people who pronounce her  name correctly (not \"Caroline\"), delicious meals (not like her father's  overblown \"recipes\"), an unusually pink and green bedroom (not like her dull  one), and plenty of horrible (very un-boring) marvels, like a man made out of  live rats.

        "0060852550": "Starred Review.[Signature]Reviewed byNina PlanckMichael Pollan is the crack investigator and graceful narrator of the ecology of local food and the toxic logic of industrial agriculture. Now he has a peer. Novelist Kingsolver recounts a year spent eating home-grown food and, if not that, local. Accomplished gardeners, the Kingsolver clan grow a large garden in southern Appalachia and spend summers \"putting food by,\" as the classic kitchen title goes. They make pickles, chutney and mozzarella; they jar tomatoes, braid garlic and stuff turkey sausage. Nine-year-old Lily runs a heritage poultry business, selling eggs and meat. What they don't raise (lamb, beef, apples) comes from local farms. Come winter, they feast on root crops and canned goods, menus slouching toward asparagus. Along the way, the Kingsolver family, having given up industrial meat years before, abandons its vegetarian ways and discovers the pleasures of conscientious carnivory.This field&mdash;local food and sustainable agriculture&mdash;is crowded with books in increasingly predictable flavors: the earnest manual, diary of an epicure, the environmental battle cry, the accidental gardener.Animal, Vegetable, Miracleis all of these, and much smarter. Kingsolver takes the genre to a new literary level; a well-paced narrative and the apparent ease of the beautiful prose makes the pages fly. Her tale is both classy and disarming, substantive and entertaining, earnest and funny. Kingsolver is a moralist (\"the conspicuous consumption of limited resources has yet to be accepted widely as a spiritual error, or even bad manners\"), but more often wry than pious. Another hazard of the genre is snobbery. You won't find it here. Seldom do paeans to heirloom tomatoes (which I grew up selling at farmers' markets) include equal respect for outstanding modern hybrids like Early Girl.Kingsolver has the ear of a journalist and the accuracy of a naturalist. She makes short, neat work of complex topics: what's risky about the vegan diet, why animals belong on ecologically sound farms, why bitterness in lettuce is good. Kingsolver's clue to help greenhorns remember what's in season is the best I've seen. You trace the harvest by botanical development, from buds to fruits to roots. Kingsolver is not the first to note our national \"eating disorder\" and the injuries industrial agriculture wreaks, yet this practical vision of how we might eat instead is as fresh as just-picked sweet corn. The narrative is peppered with useful sidebars on industrial agriculture and ecology (by husband Steven Hopp) and recipes (by daughter Camille), as if to show that local food&mdash;in the growing, buying, cooking, eating and the telling&mdash;demands teamwork.(May)Nina Planck is the author ofReal Food: What to Eat and Why(Bloomsbury USA, 2006).Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The second and more terrible is that his beloved Beatrice has been murdered, and her soul pulled down into hell by a dark force. Vowing not to accept the damnation of either souls, he gives chase, vows to get Beatrice back and descends into the infamous nine circles of hell.

She is on the swim team, wants to attend a summer writing program in New York, has applied to Brown, and is the last of her girlfriends to still have her virginity. When the rakish Sebastian Kydd returns to town, all the girls in the school become distracted, but he seems to have his eye on Carrie, at least until her best friend begins to take notice of him. The action is lightweight: senior pranks are played, dates are prevalent, friendships are tested, and Carrie keeps letting boys run rampant over her. It takes most of the book for her to stand up for herself. This protagonist is clearly written to resemble her older self as portrayed in the TV seriesSex and the City. She spends the novel questioning relationships; worrying about friendships; developing a funky, independent sense of fashion; flirting with boys while dating two at once; and having a gay male friend. The author is known for writing frivolous, adult chick-lit books and she does not stray from that style here. While toning down the antics that take place in her adult books, she still writes about partying, drinking, smoking (cigarettes and dope), sex, and shoplifting, making this book best suited to older teens looking for a diversion.&mdash;Geri Diorio, The Ridgefield Library, CTCopyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The makers have mined the same plot for four installments, based on the same few heroic tales of ancient China. The dialogue is as stilted as ever, and no real surprises unfold. But think of the zealotry people have for goofy, unrealistic kung fu flicks, and you'll start to see Dynasty Warriors' lasting appeal.If you've never touched an earlier version of the game, here's what to  know:Dynasty Warriorsis a fighting game series played from the third-person perspective, where you pick a military general as your avatar and fight through across sprawling battlefields. The generals all have distinct personalities, and there are a few women characters included, too. As you campaign, you collect special items--such as the Dragon Amulet, which increases your Musou gauge (Musou allows you to enact special, prolonged attacks on multiple enemies.) You have bodyguards, you kill enemy generals, and along the way your new skill points increase your weapon's power.WithDW4, there are many new additions, only some of which are  successful. Charge attacks and items are souped up and truly improved.  For example, equipping a magic orb can cause you to freeze enemies in a block of ice. You can edit characters, but with so many good preset ones to choose from, chances are you won't spend a lot of time working on your own. In addition to a better game engine, there's also the option of one-on-one-duels. The maps are immense compared to previous editions, with a lot more variance in what can happen by the end of your mission.Even with a significant number of new features, it's debatable whetherDynasty Warriors 4is a true overhaul, or just another release to cash in on the massive popularity of the franchise. Regardless, it's addictive for reasons that almost defy explanation. You just want to clear this act, to get to the next stage, and to reveal the goodies you've received from killing that big boss.

From painful admissions of infidelity to breathtaking revelations and endearing sentiments, Warren's latest collection will shock and move readers of every age, revealing secrets that have haunted their creators for a lifetime.Six PostSecrets fromA Lifetime of SecretsHere are six of the PostSecrets included inA Lifetime of Secrets, and never before seen online. Click on each image to see a larger version.Frank Warren's Introduction toA Lifetime of SecretsWhen I told my father I was collecting secrets from strangers for an art project, he didn&#x92;t know what to think. I tried to explain how the thousands of secrets that had been mailed to me were more than mere confessions. They could be beautiful, funny, sorrowful, inspiring.\"But, Frank,\" he asked, \"why are you soliciting secrets from strangers, and why would anyone tell you a real secret?\"I invited my father to fly out for a PostSecret art exhibit in Washington, D.C., where hundreds of the postcards were on display. More than 15,000 people came to see the secrets, and my father was there, day after day, to hear many of their transformative stories. Some people told me they recognized a hidden part of themselves on a stranger&#x92;s postcard. Others shared personal experiences of how talking about a painful secret had helped heal a lifelong relationship.The exhibit came to an end and I took my father back to the airport to catch a red-eye flight home. During our drive we passed through a long dark stretch of highway when my father broke the silence by asking me, \"Do you want to know my secret?\" He bravely recounted a traumatic childhood experience. When he finished, we had a true talk that gave me a richer understanding of my father and recast our relationship.&#x95; &#x95; &#x95;ForA Lifetime of Secrets, the fourth PostSecret book, I've selected postcards that show how secrets can reveal a momentary impulse or haunt us for decades and arranged them by age to follow the common journey we all take through childhood, adolescence, adulthood, maturity. Stretched over a full lifespan, the secrets expose the meaningful ways we change over time, and the surprising ways we don't.The postcards narrate childhood stories that have never been spoken; they voice the guarded confessions of our parents and grandparents. They confirm that our rich interior lives are not defined by how old we are, and that with aging comes not only loss but also the possibility of grace and wisdom.The following two secrets arrived in my mailbox the same week. The postmarks on each card were different, but when I posted them together on the PostSecret website (www.postsecret.com) they seemed as though they could have been written by the same person at two different points in her life.I am a junior in high school. I have good friends and a loving family. I am smart. I am a good athlete and musician. But I would trade all that in if it meant I would be beautiful.I spent my high school years believing I was UGLY. I just went through a photo album that had pictures of me over the last 20 years. Turns out I was/am kind of cute. No more wasting time on thinking otherwise.&#x95; &#x95; &#x95;When I give PostSecret presentations at college campuses, my hope is that people I have never met will be inspired to change their lives through the secrets and stories being shared. Not long ago, at one of my talks, it was my life that was changed, and the secret that inspired me came from a stranger in the front row.I began my presentation by handing out blank postcards to everyone in the auditorium. I invited each person to anonymously write down a secret on a card and then pass it on. For the next hour, the postcards circulated and were read silently multiple times. At the end of my talk, I asked if anyone would like to stand and read the secret they were holding at that moment. A man in the front row stood up and haltingly read:I wish I could apologize to my younger brother for the way I treated him growing up.He sat down and exchanged a long look with the young man next to him. After more volunteers read aloud some of the other secrets that had been passed around, I collected all the cards. The man in the front row handed me the postcard he had read from, and the two men walked out together.His postcard was blank.I have witnessed many times how the courage of sharing a secret can be contagious. When I realized that the man had been pretending to read someone else&#x92;s secret and that the person he had left with was likely his brother, I was inspired.Growing up, I was not an ideal older brother. As an adult, I have wished for an opportunity to apologize for some of my actions but did not want to open old wounds. I have not shared this secret with my brother . . . until now.--Frank Warren",

        "B00000DMAT": "GoldenEye 007has been a huge success for Rareware, and it's easy to see why. More than a simple movie translation, this has earned its top-seller status on its own. Fans ofDoomandQuakewill recognize the first-person shooter perspective, but there the similarity ends. James Bond 007 has too much style to simply blast everything in sight and move to the next level. No, as 007, the player has a variety of different missions to perform, each with its own specific objectives. Each mission follows thefilmclosely, and so James must use stealth and cunning as much as brute force. But if you see a Kalashnikov rifle lying around, by all means pick it up.Controls are easy to master, which is impressive considering the variety of actions the onscreen hero can perform. James can run and walk at variable speeds, duck, pivot, hide, attach mines to enemy helicopters, block doors from opening, and more. The optional auto-aim feature is especially nice. Of course, James Bond is proficient in a wide variety of weapons. You get to use them all, from the trusty Walther PPK (with silencer) to double sets of full-auto machine guns.The game's faithful tribute to the Bond legacy includes briefing dossiers on each mission, complete with wisecracks from Q and flirtatious comments from Moneypenny. And the 3-D representation of locations and characters from the movie is very impressive. The Rareware team spent time on the set with digital cameras, and it shows.One of the distinguishing features of the game is the outstanding artificial intelligence of the enemies. When attacked, squads will rush to hit the alarm. If they make it, reinforcements come running. Enemy soldiers respond to being shot or blown up with chilling realism. According to Rareware, there are over 30 different animation routines that come into play, depending on where the soldier is hit. For those who prefer the challenge of human opponents, there are six clever multiplayer modes where up to four players can shoot it out, as teams or solo agents.With excellent gameplay, intelligence, and style,GoldenEye 007is a first-person shooter that'll keep you coming back for more.--Jeanne UyPros:Built-in save capability for up to 4 playersAuto-aim feature helps novice players feel like a sharpshooterRich, complex game world filled with detail and varietyGreat bonus missionsCons:Sometimes cinematic scenes for fulfilling mission objectives are a bit anticlimactic",

        "0060731583": "As Commander in Chief of the United States Central Command from July 2000 through July 2003, Tommy Franks led the American and Coalition forces to victory in both Afghanistan and Iraq. Unsurprisingly, the portions ofAmerican Soldiercovering these wars are the most interesting because they combine military maneuvers, political wrangling, and lots of action and commentary. This does not mean, however, that the rest of his autobiography is dull. General Franks's writing is clear and engaging and his insider's perspective is informative and interesting, particularly when he explains how the military moved into the 21st century by emphasizing speed, agility, and better cooperation among the various branches--a significant shift from the first Persian Gulf war just a decade earlier.In addition to his years as a war general, his memoir also covers his childhood, his early years in the Army, his tours of Vietnam, and how he contemplated retirement before being called up as commander of Central Command, \"the most diverse, strategically vital&#x97;and unstable&#x97;region of the planet.\" Ever the diplomat, General Franks offers insights, but little criticism of individuals. Other than expressing admiration for his own staff and for President Bush and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld in particular, he is tight-lipped about any conflict within the administration that may have occurred regarding policy issues. (The one exception is counterterrorism specialist Richard Clarke. \"I never received a single operational recommendation, or a single page of actionable intelligence, from Richard Clarke,\" he writes). He also writes that he was surprised by the absence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and that no WMDs were used against American troops. Still, the invasion of Iraq was justified in his eyes: \"While we may not have found actual WMD stockpiles, what the Coalition discovered was the equivalent of a disassembled pistol, lying on a table beside neatly arranged trays of bullets.\"American Soldieris a compelling look at the war on terrorism from one who served on the frontlines as both a warrior and a diplomat. --Shawn Carkonen",

He has been nominated for both the Hugo and the Campbell Award and has won two Parsec Awards for his podcastWriting Excuses. Robison Wells, Dan&rsquo;s younger brother, is the author ofVariant, whichPublishers Weeklycalled &ldquo;a chilling, masterful debut&rdquo; in a starred review, and its sequel,Feedback(available Fall 2012). Here, Robison interviews his brother aboutPartials, Dan&rsquo;s pulse-pounding first book in his post-apocalyptic series that questions the very concept of what it means to be human.Robison:Dan is my brother, exactly 13 months older than me. He and I shared a room our entire childhood, took the same classes, even dated the same girls. Dan got me into writing about twelve years ago, and ever since we&rsquo;ve critiqued each other&rsquo;s work, brainstormed new ideas, and told each other how terrible he is. So, with such a long background together, I&rsquo;m particularly interested to see if I can learn anything new in this interview.I&rsquo;ve read so much of your writing over the years, from your poem about turkeys in the fifth grade to your first epic fantasy to your literary farce to your horror, and now your YA post-apocalyptic Partials. Is there anything you&rsquo;ve written that I&rsquo;d be surprised to hear about?Dan:I wrote someRiftsfan fiction in high school&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know if you knew about that. I actually reused a part of it forPartials.Robison:What part?Dan:I won&rsquo;t say, but it&rsquo;s in the first third.Robison:You&rsquo;ve written in all these different genres: Is it because you&rsquo;re still looking for the perfect fit? Or are you just interested in writing lots of different things?Dan:Almost every book I write is a new genre, or a weird combination of genres, because I like to branch out and try new things. I never would have imagined that I&rsquo;d write a horror series, but that was the first book I published. I never would have found that character, or the audience that loves him, if I&rsquo;d forced myself to stick to one thing.Robison:How was the transition from supernatural to sci-fi?Dan:Not too bad, since I see them as very connected&mdash;the only real difference between fantasy and SF is the explanation of where the weird stuff comes from. SF ended up being a lot harder, in some ways, because I had to make those explanations scientifically sound. In my horror series I could just say, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a monster!&rdquo; With SF I had to do a ton of research into genetics, biology, and the science of decay.Robison:How did you do your research?Dan:A lot of my research started online, including Wikipedia&mdash;people make fun of it as a research tool, and I admit that it&rsquo;s a terrible place to end your research, but it&rsquo;s a fantastic place to start. From there I found more detailed websites, and eventually some great connections to books. One of the most useful books I read wasThe World Without Usby Alan Weisman, about what would happen to the things we leave behind if we suddenly weren&rsquo;t there to take care of them. It&rsquo;s a very detailed combination of scientific research and thought experiment.InPartials, the apocalypse wasn&rsquo;t a bomb or a war or anything physically destructive, just a disease: We died, but all our stuff is still just sitting there. It was a fun situation to study, and a blast to depict in a book.Robison:So, having done all that research, what tips would you give for surviving an apocalyptic pandemic? Let&rsquo;s assume you&rsquo;re immune to the virus.Dan:I don&rsquo;t know how you&rsquo;re going to work that out, but there you go. Once you have that taken care of, you live in a combination of paradise and medieval squalor. You will have no electricity or running water, but almost everything else will be free. Canned food can last for a decade or more before going bad, so you can live at a subsistence level just by scavenging the local stores.Robison:Why do you think your society of survivors ended up being organized and civil and less Mad Max-ish?Dan:A big part of it is the scarcity issue. Mad Max and similar apocalyptic scenarios start with the premise that everything is destroyed. The survivors have to fight tooth and nail for what little resources are left. InPartials, everything you could ever want is just there for the taking.Robison:What books/movies/music/TV influencedPartials?Dan:Some of the influences are obvious, likeBattlestar GalacticaandChildren of Men. Others are harder to spot. I listened to a steady diet of protest songs and revolutionary music while writing, stuff like &ldquo;Uprising&rdquo; by Muse, because they got my blood going and helped me get into the main character&rsquo;s fiery personality. And some of my influences didn&rsquo;t really end up in the book, though I still count them&mdash;things likeMad MaxandA Canticle for Leibowitzthat inspired my love of post-apocalyptic stories, but which didn&rsquo;t really apply in this case.The biggest influence may have been our own history and current events.Partialsis, at times, a very angry book, and that&rsquo;s a reflection of my own feelings about a lot of the stuff I see going on in the world.Robison:Let&rsquo;s talk about that. You&rsquo;ve said before that you think one of the reasons dystopia is so popular right now is because our world is becoming more dystopian. What current events influenced you inPartials?Dan:For example, the story is set eleven years after a devastating catastrophe&mdash;and in 2012, my readers are also eleven years after their own devastating catastrophe. The events of 9/11 changed the way we do almost everything in this country, and to a lesser extent the rest of the world. One of the things I tried to do in the book was show that the adults, who remember what life was like before the end of the world, have a very different attitude about it than the kids who&rsquo;ve never really known any other life.I also tried to throw in a lot of the extreme measures our government and our culture in general have taken in response to terrorism&mdash;reduced privacy, indefinite detention, torture, and so on. I think there are arguments on both sides of all these issues, and I tried to give each side a fair shake. Kira, the main character, has very strong ideas about what&rsquo;s justifiable and what&rsquo;s not, and just because she&rsquo;s the main character doesn&rsquo;t mean she&rsquo;s always right. If anyone&rsquo;s actually &ldquo;right&rdquo; at all.Robison:So, on a happier note, why do you think I&rsquo;m so awesome?Dan:Because you take after your brother.",

        "0061727679": "Amazon Exclusive: Lee Child Interviews Jacqueline WinspearJacqueline Winspear, like her interviewer, the iconic, bestselling authorLee Child, originally hails from the United Kingdom.A Lesson in Secretsis her eighth novel featuring psychologist-investigator and former WW1 nurse, Maisie Dobbs.  Here she talks with Child about her work on the series, and her enduring interest in the aftermath of WW1.Lee Child:People are often surprised that I'm a huge Maisie Dobbs fan, because Jack Reacher is all about a kind of Spartan American masculinity, and Maisie Dobbs is all about a kind of feminine English refinement.  But they're both strong, unconventional people.  Perhaps that's the cross-genre appeal?  Do you find that Maisie attracts an unusual mix of readers?Jacqueline Winspear:I&rsquo;m thrilled you&rsquo;re such a Maisie Dobbs fan--and you can count me among those millions of Jack Reacher fans.  Maisie and Reacher are both unconventional, but I believe another factor in their cross-genre appeal is that both have endured life-changing challenges.  Maisie attracts diverse readers: men and women, all age groups, veterans, nurses, college students, people who have faced troubles, and people interested in the era.LC:And in fact your novels are driven by violence far worse than mine--off the page, granted, but there&rsquo;s no getting around the fact that at the heart of your books is the aftermath of a horrendous war, with its attendant violence and death.  How do you see the role of violence in your novels?JW:I think you hit the theme there with &ldquo;aftermath.&rdquo;  The violence in my books is that searing, painful residue left by the passing of a terrible time, when people were also crushed emotionally by the deep losses over a four-year period.  In addition, there&rsquo;s that element of violence that lingers--inAmong the Mad, for example--when war&rsquo;s tentacles will not let go.  We see that again today in the stories of veterans who are still fighting their wars, but the conflict is raging inside them.LC:As a kid in England I remember seeing hundreds of maimed old men, and hundreds of lonely old women.  My grandfather was an example of the first, and two great-aunts examples of the second - sad reminders of a terrible time.  Was it something similar that drew you to the First World War and the &ldquo;Between the Wars&rdquo; era that followed?JW:I have the same memories--my grandfather was wounded at the Battle of the Somme, and my grandmother was partially blinded at the Woolwich Arsenal, in an explosion that wounded her sister and killed several girls working alongside her. There were the elderly spinsters in my neighborhood, and for each there was that old sepia photograph on the mantelpiece, of a sweetheart or brother lost to war. Those childhood memories led me to think a lot about what happens after war is done.  As a character says inBirds of a Feather, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the trouble with war; it lives on inside the living.&rdquo;LC:I was introduced to Maisie Dobbs by my wife, who passed through an airport and picked up the first in the series.  She loved it, and urged me to read it, and I'm glad I did.  It's one of the very, very few series we both love equally--in fact, perhaps the only one.  Is this typical of your readers?JW:I receive so many emails from fans who tell me that the books are read by all members of the family. And many women tell me that it was their husband who first discovered Maisie.  The books are as accessible to readers aged about fourteen as they are to seniors. There are few things today that all age groups within a family can engage in, discuss and get excited about, so it&rsquo;s lovely when I hear that family members are awaiting the next book so they can all read it.LC:Maisie is definitively feminine, but she's running a business, and poking around in a \"man's world,\" which is true to the times, and indicative of the early stages of feminism in the West.  Was that something you wanted to explore?JW:It would have been difficult to introduce a character such as Maisie and not explore the fact that the Great War left so many women to forge a life alone.  If there was one thing I wanted to do, it was to bring the spirit of that generation to the character of Maisie Dobbs.  Of course, some women floundered and lived lonely lives, but there were a great many who blazed a trail.  I believe an archetype was born at that time--the stoic British woman who is independent and more than a little opinionated, with a heart of gold under a tough exterior, and who knows what it is to endure.  Dame Maggie Smith has played that character in several films.LC:Maisie understands human psychology in a way that seems to be an early and experimental pre-echo of what we'd now call criminal profiling.  It's a huge part of both her process and her appeal.  Where did that come from?JW:That developed in a very organic way.  Having established her as a &ldquo;sensitive,&rdquo; I wanted to give her real expertise--and there are historical underpinnings to this aspect of her character.  Maisie studied the Moral Sciences curriculum at Girton College when psychology was in its infancy.  I have the prospectus from 1913, and about one third of the course was the study of modern psychology. It was a time of great experimentation, so Maisie&rsquo;s processes have their roots in real practices considered innovative at the time.LC:One of your decisions I admire is the way you have moved the series forward in time so firmly. Most writers would have continued mining the same immediate post-war seam forever.  What was your thinking behind that?  And how do you keep the character fresh as the series itself develops?JW:I once heard you say at a conference, &ldquo;The reader comes back to a series, not to find out what the sleuth does with the case, but what the case does to the sleuth.&rdquo;  I agree.  We are all impacted not only by our past, but by our current circumstances and those around us.  You always put Reacher in a new area, be it small town or big city; and through his wandering we learn a lot about him. I work with the geography of time. Not everyone likes change and many readers would like Maisie Dobbs to stay as she is in a given book.  But life&rsquo;s not like that--the goalposts tend to move when we are at our most comfortable, and I want to keep the series fresh.LC:I&rsquo;m often asked if I have a favorite book within my series, so now I&rsquo;m turning the tables:  Do you have favorites among your novels?JW:That&rsquo;s such a difficult question, because each book not only represents a different place on my journey as a writer, but has been inspired by something that touched me.  I thinkMaisie Dobbswill always be very tightly held in my affections, because it was my first book and was written at a difficult time in my life, when I was recovering from a horrible accident.  The other choice would be TheMapping of Love and Death, because it was inspired by the true story of a soldier whose remains lay under Belgian soil for some 90 years until unearthed by a farmer. I learned more about him when I became involved in the quest to discover his origins.  When I look at that book, I think of a young man lost to war who was never identified and who was eventually laid to rest as &ldquo;A Soldier of The Great War, Known Unto God.&rdquo; I ache for the parents who never knew where their son died, for he had probably been listed as &ldquo;Missing, Presumed Dead.&rdquo;",

Their father is a charismatic detective for the San Francisco Police Department who has been chronically unfaithful to his wife, which has led to their divorce. Their emotionally fragile mother is severely depressed and spends a lot of time in her bedroom. The sisters amuse themselves by watching television through their neighbors&#x2019; picture windows (providing their own dialogue). But their suburban life is upended when a serial killer starts leaving the bodies of young girls all over the trails of their beloved mountain. Their father, who loved to make his own pasta and belt out Dean Martin songs, is greatly diminished over the many years he devotes to trying to find the vicious killer. The plot of Maynard&#x2019;s eighth novel, although based on the story of the real-life Trailside Killer, strains credulity at times; it is less a thriller than an affecting portrait of the relationship between a father and his daughters. --Joanne Wilkinson",
        "B00006HBTW": "It&#x92;s a pretty bold claim but for many,Mario Partyis the best multiplayer game series ever. No need for guns or complicated role-playing elements here--Mario Partyis fun because it&#x92;s simple. The original N64 game created an entirely new subgenre--an unlikely combination of traditional board games and lots of ultrasimple arcade titles. The idea is that you travel around the board trying to collect stars, which must be paid for with coins, and you get coins by competing in minigames, which occur at the end of every round. These minigames generally don&#x92;t last longer than a minute or two, and many are based on oldGame & Watchtitles. There are over 50 minigames inMario Party 4, and each involves either a free-for-all, two players against two, or one against three (depending where you land on the board at the end of your turn). These can involve anything from skydiving to basketball dunking, or car racing to hide-and-seek, to name a few.Admittedly, this basic description of the gameplay might not sound too exciting, and indeed if you&#x92;re playing with less than three human opponents it can be pretty tedious. But play it with the full complement of non-virtual rivals and the game&#x92;s infinite capacity for cheating, backstabbing, and ganging up allows it to completely transcend the humdrum sum of its parts. There&#x92;s nothing terribly new in this third sequel except that the graphics are much improved and the minigames are all new, but that really misses the point: get this game out at Christmas instead ofTrivial Pursuitand you&#x92;ll wonder how you ever got through the holiday without it.--David Jenkins, Amazon.co.uk",

In fact, the ability to focus, more than IQ or social background, is the key to performance and success. Neuroscience, case studies, and personal experience contribute to Goleman&#x2019;s exploration of focus, which includes concentration, selective attention, open awareness, self-awareness, empathy, and systems awareness. He breaks them down to inner, other, and outer focus. Among examples of the significance of focus: a doctor&#x2019;s ability to shut down emotions to focus on gory medical procedures; an epidemiologist&#x2019;s attention to patterns and systems to track the human connections that lead to global pandemics; and a gamer&#x2019;s focus on spatial perception, decision making, and ability to track objects. In commerce, education, sports, and personal life, Goleman offers concepts and techniques, including mindfulness and meditation, to train ourselves to be more focused, exercising those areas of the brain involved in focusing attention.

AsJingobegins, an island suddenly rises between Ankh-Morpork and Al-Khali, capital of Klatch. Both cities claim it. Lord Vetinari, the Patrician, has failed to convince the Ruling Council that force is a bad idea, despite reminding them that they have no army, and \"I believe one of those is generally considered vital to the successful prosecution of a war.\"  Samuel Vimes, Commander of the City Watch, has to find out who shot the Klatchian envoy, Prince Khufurah, and set fire to their embassy, before war breaks out.Pratchett's characters are both sympathetic and outrageously entertaining, from Captain Carrot, who always finds the best in people and puts it to work playing football, to Sergeant Colon and his sidekick, Corporal Nobbs, who have \"an ability to get out of their depth on a wet pavement.\" Then there is the mysterious D'reg, 71-hour Ahmed.

        "0060809779": "Bigger Thomas is doomed, trapped in a downward spiral that will lead to arrest, prison, or death, driven by despair, frustration, poverty, and incomprehension. As a young black man in the Chicago of the '30s, he has no way out of the walls of poverty and racism that surround him, and after he murders a young white woman in a moment of panic, these walls begin to close in. There is no help for him--not from his hapless family; not from liberal do-gooders or from his well-meaning yet naive friend Jan; certainly not from the police, prosecutors, or judges. Bigger is debased, aggressive, dangerous, and a violent criminal. As such, he has no claim upon our compassion or sympathy. And yet...A more compelling story thanNative Sonhas not been written in the 20th century by an American writer. That is not to say that Richard Wright created a novel free of flaws, but that he wrote the first novel that successfully told the most painful and unvarnished truth about American social and class relations. AsIrving Howeasserted in 1963, \"The dayNative Sonappeared, American culture was changed forever. It made impossible a repetition of the old lies [and] brought out into the open, as no one ever had before, the hatred, fear and violence that have crippled and may yet destroy our culture.\"Other books had focused on the experience of growing up black in America--including Wright's own highly successfulUncle Tom's Children, a collection of five stories that focused on the victimization of blacks who transgressed the code of racial segregation. But they suffered from what he saw as a kind of lyrical idealism, setting up sympathetic black characters in oppressive situations and evoking the reader's pity. InNative Son, Wright was aiming at something more. In Bigger, he created a character so damaged by racism and poverty, with dreams so perverted, and with human sensibilities so eroded, that he has no claim on the reader's compassion:\"I didn't want to kill,\" Bigger shouted. \"But what I killed for, I am! It must've been pretty deep in me to make me kill! I must have felt it awful hard to murder.... What I killed for must've been good!\" Bigger's voice was full of frenzied anguish. \"It must have been good! When a man kills, it's for something... I didn't know I was really alive in this world until I felt things hard enough to kill for 'em. It's the truth...\"Wright's genius was that, in preventing us from feeling pity for Bigger, he forced us to confront the hopelessness, misery, and injustice of the society that gave birth to him.--Andrew Himes",

But this one&#x2019;s a bit different: it stars former Army Ranger Tucker Wayne and his working dog, Kane (introduced in Bloodline, 2012), and it spends more time than usual exploring the relationships of its lead characters. Rollins, who was a practicing veterinarian before turning to full-time writing, makes Kane, a Belgian Malinois (they look a lot like German shepherds), a fully participating character in the story, similar to the way Jonathan Maberry makes Ghost a character in the Joe Ledger novels. Coauthor Blackwood is best known for the three Fargo novels he wrote with Clive Cussler, but his solo trilogy featuring covert op Briggs Tanner, published 2001&#x2013;03, gives him solid grounding for this novel.

        "0060392827": "Gregory Maguire's chilling, wonderful retelling ofCinderellais a study in contrasts. Love and hate, beauty and ugliness, cruelty and charity--each idea is stripped of its ethical trappings, smashed up against its opposite number, and laid bare for our examination.Confessions of an Ugly Stepsisterbegins in 17th-century Holland, where the two Fisher  sisters and their mother have fled to escape a hostile England. Maguire's characters are at once more human and more fanciful than their fairy-tale originals.  Plain but smart Iris and her sister, Ruth, a hulking simpleton, are dazed and terrified as their mother, Margarethe, urges them into the strange Dutch streets. Within days, purposeful Margarethe has secured the family a place in  the home of an aspiring painter, where for a short time, they find happiness.But this isCinderella, after all, and tragedy is inevitable. When a wealthy tulip speculator commissions the painter to capture his blindingly lovely daughter, Clara, on canvas, Margarethe jumps at the chance to better their lot. \"Give me room to cast my eel spear, and let follow what may,\" she crows, and the Fisher family abandons the artist  for the upper-crust Van den Meers.When Van den Meer's wife dies during childbirth, the stage is set for Margarethe to take over the household and for Clara to adopt the role  of \"Cinderling\" in order to survive. What follows is a changeling adventure, and of course a ball, a handsome prince, a  lost slipper, and what might even be a fairy godmother. In a single magic night, the exquisite and the ugly swirl around in a heated mix:Everything about this moment hovers, trembles, all their sweet, unreasonable hopes on view before anything has had the chance to go wrong. A stepsister spins on black and white tiles, in glass  slippers and a gold gown, and two stepsisters watch with unrelieved admiration. The light pours in, strengthening in its golden hue as the sun sinks  and the evening approaches. Clara is as otherworldly as the Donkeywoman,  the Girl-Boy. Extreme beauty is an affliction...But beyond these familiar elements, Maguire's second novel becomes something else altogether--a morality play, a psychological study, a feminist manifesto, or perhaps a plain explanation of what it is to be human. Villains turn out to be heroes, and heroes disappoint. The story's narrator wryly observes, \"In the lives of children, pumpkins can turn into coaches, mice and rats into human beings. When we grow up, we  learn that it's far more common for human beings to turn into rats.\"--Therese Littleton",
        "0061097101": "Unlike the Graces of Greek mythology, the ones in Patricia Gaffney's feel-good novel,The Saving Graces, are not in the business of dispensing charm and beauty. Though they possess some measure of good looks, Gaffney's Graces are more focused on the less ethereal problems of life: men, careers, babies, death. And there are four, rather than three, of them (Emma, Rudy, Lee, and Isabel), who have been getting together for regular dinners in their Washington, D.C., homes for 10 years.The narration ofThe Saving Gracesrotates among the four women and gets right to the heart of each Grace--the stories they tell stick close to the territory of their emotional lives. This intimate directness makes Gaffney's women seem, well, womanly. Serene Isabel, who has always been \"the best champion, the kindest friend\" to all the other Graces, is dying of breast cancer. Rudy needs to leave her ultra-controlling husband. Lee, usually the rational one, is possessed by her desire to have a baby. Ironic Emma wants to write a novel and has a hard crush on a married man. This group feels messy and real: they keep secrets from each other, grate on one another's nerves, and analyze each other. But ultimately, all four know that they've lucked into a very good thing. Not just because they share the sweetness and silliness that comes with friendship, but also because they are willing to act as soldiers for each other. When Rudy finally gets up the nerve to leave her husband, for example, she doesn't do it alone: \"Isabel stood on my right, Lee on my left. Emma had taken a seat on the bed--an escalation of the offense, usurping more enemy territory.\" In Gaffney's universe, women armed with grace, humor, and a couple of good girlfriends can transcend even the most painful events in their lives.--Katherine Anderson--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",
        "0060509422": "Jennifer Haigh's first novel,Mrs. Kimble, was an auspicious debut about three women who marry the same man--consecutively--and their ability to kid themselves about who he is, and, more to the point, who they are. It won the PEN/Hemingway Award, given annually for best first fiction.  Haigh has beaten the sophomore slump with another page-turner:Baker Towers. The action, such as it is, takes place in post-World War II Bakerton, a Pennsylvania mining town. \"...[T]he town's most famous landmark, known locally as the Towers, two looming piles of mine waste. They are forty feet high and growing... The mines were not named for Bakerton; Bakerton was named for the mines. This is an important distinction. It explains the order of things. Haigh lets us know this on page two, setting the backdrop for the family drama of the Novaks.The story begins with the death of Stanley Novak, wife of Rose and father of Georgie, Dorothy, Joyce, Lucy, and Sandy. This is an Italian-Polish marriage, tolerated, but a break with the town's tradition. The personality, temperament and needs of all five Novaks are made clear to us by their choices--although they are not always clear to the Novaks. Their interaction, with each other and their community, is the stuff of the novel. Life revolves around the mines, the Church, gossip, and sports.  Many times throughout the book it seems that Haigh is using a camera rather than a pen, so perfectly does she create a scene for the reader.Georgie struggles to get away from Bakerton after his military service by going to Philadelphia and marrying the boss's daughter, a decision he lives to regret. Dorothy gets a job in D.C., but never really fits into the scene. A breakdown brings her home for good. Joyce joins the military, is appalled by the way she is treated, and hastens home to care for her ailing mother. Lucy, overweight and unwelcome with the \"in\" crowd, longs to be Fire Queen, the pinnacle of acceptance in Bakerton. Sandy, handsome and unreliable, leaves for big city life, finds it, and comes home periodically to hide out.Haigh has captured these people's lives as they play out, more acted upon than acting.  None of the Novaks is self-reflective; the girls accept the status quo, the boys escape and find that they have taken themselves with them. A foreshadowing of the changes that will take place is symbolized by a horrific mine explosion at the end of the book.  This life that Haigh has so carefully described will soon disappear forever, for good or ill, but she has illuminated its current reality with a sure hand.--Valerie Ryan--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

When Link travels to the Twilight Realm, he transforms into a wolf and must scour the land with the help of a mysterious girl named Midna. Besides his trusty sword and shield, Link will use his bow and arrows by aiming with the Wii Remote controller, fight while on horseback and use a wealth of other items, both new and old.The most epic Zelda ever launches with the Wii.Link roams an entirely new land of Hyrule.View larger.Take control of your trusty horse as you travel from quest to quest.View larger.Link must solve a number of challenging puzzles to progress to boss battles.View larger.Fishing with the Wii Remote is a fun and worthwhile diversion.View larger.Link's journeys, reinventedHailed by many as the best Zelda game since 1998'sOcarina of Time,Twilight Princessthrusts players into a troubled world ravaged by a dangerous magic. Sporting a new, more realistic visual style than the previous Zelda title, Link looks much more like an adult than in previous installments and fits well into an environment that provides Zelda fans with a much more gritty and grim environment to explore. The entirety of the quest fits this darker mood, as both Link and NPC's alike share the same concern for the changes about in Hyrule.More than just a spiritual successor to previous Zelda installments,Twilight Princessoffers players a new way of controlling Link through dungeons, forests, towns, and the bizarre Twilight Realm: precise weapon controls with the Wii remote! Players can use the remote to control Links' weapons including the sword, arrows, and boomerang. This new control scheme allows for much faster and more accurate control than on previous Nintendo hardware. For example, waving the remote in the air will result in Link performing the same move with the sword. To fire off on arrow, players \"pull back\" on a virtual controller string as the Wii remote's speaker lets players know that the projectile is ready for release. It all works incredibly well and adds to the title's immersion and style- you feel more in the center of the action than in previous Zelda games.As impressive as the new control scheme is, the scope and size of the new land of the Hyrule is equally as impressive- truly the Wii's first epic adventure. Beautifully crafted and four years in the making, the land players travel through is vast and diverse as the dungeons and monsters that lie within. As players collect triforce pieces from the distant sections of the continent, they will get to know many different villages and foes. Thankfully, Link will be able to move over long stretches of land faster thanks to \"Epona,\" your faithful horse. Epona also helps Link become a more effective fighter, as a number of powerful and impressive sword strikes can be launched while galloping through fields of enemies.The Twilight Realm awaitsLike most games in the Zelda franchise, Link begins his adventure with little more than the clothes he has on an an inkling that something has gone awry. After an initial trip to the Twilight Realm, in which Link appears as a wolf, a friendly shadow dweller named Midna will meet up with players and give helpful advice on gameplay. Fortunately for players, this virtual assistant spells out ways to be a more effective adventurer in and out of the shadow world. Early stages of the game have Link spending a lot of time in the Twilight Realm, and outdoor areas of Hyrule, attempting to clear areas of the strange darkness that has seemingly fallen over every village, forest, and field. As the story progresses, players will learn the cause of the shadows, and what they must to do vanquish them for good.Puzzling puzzlesLink once again finds himself in a number of classic Zelda-esque puzzle scenarios in which he must light torches to unlock doors, raise and lower water levels, and fight enemies to collect keys and open chests for valuable rupees. A number of the dungeons present unique puzzle challenges that rely on the player's ability to hone their Wii remote's control, such as an air castle in the sky that can only be accessed by an extremely accurate grappling hook toss.In general,Twilight Princessis more challenging than the average Zelda game, with a number of boss battles having protracted hit sequences with little support potions about, and even less warning. Still, there's never been an adventure experience such as this, wherein players can literally charge at a dungeon boss with their fists and punch the air to defeat an enormous foe. As the finest Zelda experience in almost ten years and the game fans have been waiting for,Twilight Princesswill delight young and old gamers alike.",

Michael keeps Patrick from freaking out by keeping score after each attack and relating his instructions from the Game Master each morning. Maintaining this facade becomes more difficult, however, as they meet other survivors and become involved with the mercurial Captain Jopek. Though the story is told in the third person, Michael's thoughts are in a distinctive, stream-of-consciousness voice that takes some getting used to but effectively brings readers deep inside the character's head.

What we tend to forget, because the tale of Peter Pan and Neverland has been so relentlessly boiled down, hashed up, and coated in saccharine, is that J.M. Barrie's original version is also witty, sophisticated, and delightfully odd. The Darling children, Wendy, John, and Michael, live a very proper middle-class life in Edwardian London, but they also happen to have a Newfoundland for a nurse. The text is full of such throwaway gems as \"Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter Pan when she was tidying up her children's minds,\" and is peppered with deliberately obscure vocabulary including \"embonpoint,\" \"quietus,\" and \"pluperfect.\" Lest we forget, it was written in 1904, a relatively innocent age in which a plot about abducted children must have seemed more safely fanciful. Also, perhaps, it was an age that expected more of its children's books, forPeter Panhas a suppleness, lightness, and intelligence that are \"literary\" in the best sense. In a typical exchange with the dastardly Captain Hook, Peter Pan describes himself as \"youth... joy... a little bird that has broken out of the egg,\" and the author interjects: \"This, of course, was nonsense; but it was proof to the unhappy Hook that Peter did not know in the least who or what he was, which is the very pinnacle of good form.\" A book for adult readers-aloud to revel in--and it just might teach young listeners to fly.

The Drew children Simon, Jane, and Barney find an old map in a hidden room while summering at the Grey House in Cornwall. Along with their Great-Uncle Merry, they become embroiled in a web of intrigue that surrounds an Arthurian legend. True to the original story (Harcourt, 1965), this audio version adds a dynamic vocal element from narrator, Alex Jennings. In the beginning the story seems a bit slow and tedious as the plot and setting are given their due, and the voices may be difficult to distinguish. After the first side of tape 1, they become more well defined. Jennings gives each child a distinct voice, yet keeps each connected to one another. Barney has the youthful vulnerability of the youngest sibling, Jane, the sensible and soft-spoken middle child, and Simon speaks with the assurance and bravado of the \"older\" brother. The rising tension created between the fight of good and evil gives strength and vitality to each character's voice. Listeners understand Mr. Hasting's loathing and fear of Great-Uncle Merry when hearing the deep tone and resonance of every utterance. Jennings' ability is outstanding as he slips in and out of the numerous voices with the rapid dialogue as it approaches the climax. His training and experience as a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company and the Royal National Theatre give this story a vitality. This is an outstanding reading of a classic tale that all young listeners and adults will thoroughly enjoy.Tina Hudak, St. Bernard's School, Riverdale, MDCopyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",
        "0060959355": "It's a rare author who can combine a humdinger of a ghost tale with a haunting story of young love, and do so with literary grace and finesse. Gutcheon does just that and she acquits herself beautifully in this poignant novel. What's more, she adroitly manages alternating narratives, set a century apart, raising the level of suspense as the characters in each period approach the cusp on which a life turns, in parallel events that will irrevocably define the future for all of them. The novel is essentially two stories of doomed love and its consequences for future generations. Narrator Hannah Gray is an elderly widow when she relates the circumstances of the summer when she fell in love with Conary Crocker, a charming young man from a poor family in Dundee on the coast of Maine. Brought to Dundee from Boston during the Depression by her abusive stepmother, Hannah learns about the fate of distant ancestral relatives of hers and Conary's, who lived on now-deserted Beal Island in the mid 1800s. The reader learns the horrifying details in the same small increments that Hannah does, via the alternating point of view of Claris Osgood, who in 1858 defies her parents and marries taciturn Danial Haskell, moving with him to the island where, too late, she discovers her new husband's narrow-minded religious fundamentalism and corrosively mean personality. The union, which produces two children, becomes increasingly rancorous and will end in murder. Meanwhile, in her own time, Hannah is terrified by the appearances of a wildly sobbing ghost with \"gruesome burning eyes,\" who exudes almost palpable hatred. Tantalizing clues about the identity of the macabre specter, and the eventual tragedy it causes, hum through the narrative like a racing pulse. Gutcheon adds depth and texture through lovely descriptions of the Maine coast and the authentic vernacular of its residents, whom she depicts with real knowledge of life in a seacoast community. Her sophisticated prose and narrative skill mark this novel, her sixth (after Five Fortunes), as a breakthrough to a wide readership. Agent, Wendy Weil.

Called in to investigate the apparent suicide of a male Grant Tech student, Sara brings along her pregnant sister, Tessa, who wanders away from the scene and is brutally attacked. The distraught Sara must work side by side with her ex-husband, Det. Jeffrey Tolliver, whom she loves despite his past infidelity, but it's Lena Adams, formerly a cop and now a campus security guard, whose story the novel follows most closely. Still mourning the murder of her sister and recovering from her own torture and rape by the same man, Lena is looked on with suspicion by her ex-boss, Jeffrey. With reason: she's hiding a few key facts. The dead boy's mother is her therapist and Lena is involved with an abusive young man with a shady past. Campus gossip Richard Carter further confuses investigators; meanwhile, police discover the bodies of two more students, their deaths potentially suicides but more likely murder. Slaughter provides grisly variations on the themes of sibling rivalry, sexual abuse and campus politics in a story not for the faint of heart. Readers who can stomach gruesome details and like fitting together multiple stories of physical and psychological abuse will savor the way Slaughter can evoke sympathy for perverse, even criminal, behavior by tracing its origins, and those who make it through the complexities and the gore will be rewarded with a satisfyingly chilling ending.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

Lin Kong is a Chinese army doctor trapped in an arranged marriage that embarrasses and repels him. (Shuyu has country ways, a withered face, and most humiliating of all, bound feet.) Nevertheless, he's content with his tidy military life, at least until he falls in love with Manna, a nurse at his hospital.

So, year after year Lin asks his wife for his freedom, and year after year he returns from the provincial courthouse: still married, still unable to consummate his relationship with Manna. Nothing feeds love like obstacles placed in its way--right?

In the initial confusion of his chaste love affair, Lin longs for the peace and quiet of his \"old rut.\" Then killing time becomes its own kind of rut, and in the end, he is forced to conclude that he \"waited eighteen years just for the sake of waiting.\"There's a political allegory here, of course, but it grows naturally from these characters' hearts. Neither Lin nor Manna is especially ideological, and the tumultuous events occurring around them go mostly unnoticed. They meet during a forced military march, and have their first tender moment during an opera about a naval battle. (While the audience shouts, \"Down with Japanese Imperialism!\" the couple holds hands and gazes dreamily into each other's eyes.) When Lin is in Goose Village one summer, a mutual acquaintance rapes Manna; years later, the rapist appears on a TV report titled \"To Get Rich Is Glorious,\" after having made thousands in construction. Jin resists hammering ideological ironies like these home, but totalitarianism's effects on Lin are clear:Let me tell you what really happened, the voice said. All those years you waited torpidly, like a sleepwalker, pulled and pushed about by others' opinions, by external pressure, by your illusions, by the official rules you internalized. You were misled by your own frustration and passivity, believing that what you were not allowed to have was what your heart was destined to embrace.Ha Jin himself served in the People's Liberation Army, and in fact left his native country for the U.S. only in 1985. That a non-native speaker can produce English of such translucence and power is truly remarkable--but really, his prose is the least of the miracles here. Improbably, Jin makes an unconsummated 18-year love affair loom as urgent as political terror or war, while history-changing events gain the immediacy of a domestic dilemma. Gracefully phrased, impeccably paced,Waitingis the kind of realist novel you thought was no longer being written.--Mary Park--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",
        "0061558265": "Amazon Guest Review: Stephen King onThe Night EternalStephen Kingis the author of more than 50 books, all of them worldwide best-sellers. Among his most recent are theDark Towernovels,Cell,From a Buick 8,Everything's Eventual,Hearts in Atlantis,The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, andBag of Bones. He is the recipient of the 2003 National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters. He lives in Bangor, Maine, with his wife, novelist Tabitha King.The Straintrilogy opened with an authentic wow moment: a Boeing 777 arrives at JFK airport with all but four of the passengers dead in their seats. The flashlight beams of the first responders &ldquo;registered dully in the dead jewels of their open eyes.&rdquo; Not much later these corpses begin to rise from their morgue slabs, and a plague of blood-hungry predators overwhelms New York. The first hundred pages ofThe Strainis a sustained exercise in terror that held this reader in spellbound delight, because del Toro and Hogan write with crisp authenticity about both the fantastical (vampires) and the completely real (New York City, with all its odd nooks and crannies).What began inThe Straincomes to a sublimely satisfying conclusion inThe Night Eternal. Del Toro and Hogan have taken Dracula, the greatest vampire tale of them all, and deftly turned it inside out. In Stoker&rsquo;s novel, Bloodsucker Zero arrives in England on a sailing ship called the Demeter. As with the Regis Air 777, the Demeter is a ghost ship when it reaches port, the eponymous Count having snacked his way across the ocean. The difference is that Dracula is confronted by a heroic band of vampire-hunters who eventually drive him from England by using modern technology&mdash;everything from diaries kept on wax recording cylinders to blood transfusions. InThe StrainTrilogy, the body-hopping Master&mdash;who arrives at JFK in the person of Polish nobleman Jusef Sardu&mdash;uses the very technology that defeated his honorable forebear to destroy the civilized world. Big corporations are his tools; modern transportation serves to spread the vampire virus; nuclear weapons usher in a new era of pollution and atmospheric darkness.Only jolly old England escapes; the wily Brits have blown up the Chunnel early on, and remain relatively vampire-free. At moments like this, the reader senses del Toro and Hogan tucking their tongues in their cheeks and having a gleeful blast.When speaking of the New World Order in Henry the Sixth, Shakespeare has one of his characters say, &ldquo;The first thing we do, let&rsquo;s kill all the lawyers.&rdquo; As TheNight Eternalopens, the Master (currently having traded the body of Sardu for that of rock star Gabriel Bolivar) doubles down on that, ordering his minions to kill not just those in the legal profession but all the CEOs, tycoons, intellectuals, rebels, and artists.  &ldquo;Their execution was swift, public and brutal. Out they marched, the damned, out of the River House, the Dakota, the Beresford and their ilk&hellip;in a horrific pageant of carnage, they were disposed of.&rdquo;With the exception of heroic pawnbroker/scholar Abraham Setrakian (who almost destroyed the Master in Volume Two,The Fall), the winning cast of human characters from the previous novels are all present and accounted for: Nora Martinez, who has traded in her scientist&rsquo;s microscope for a silver sword; Vasily Fet, who now exterminates vampires instead of rats; Augustin &ldquo;Gus&rdquo; Elizade, once a gangbanger and now a hero of resistance. There&rsquo;s also the less-than-admirable but fascinating (in a repulsive way, it&rsquo;s true) Alfonso Creem, with his insatiable appetite and his vampire-repelling mouthful of silver teeth.And there&rsquo;s Eph Goodweather, the epidemiologist around whom all these others revolve. WhenThe Night Eternalbegins, two years after the Master has used nuclear weapons to create vampire-friendly darkness all over the planet, Eph has fallen on hard times. His undead ex-wife stalks him relentlessly (he is, after all, one of her &ldquo;Dear Ones&rdquo;), his son has become a rifle-toting, obsessive-compulsive acolyte of the Master, and Eph himself has started popping Vicodin and oxycodone. Nora has left him for Vasily Fet, and Eph is viewed with distrust by those who used to rally around him. Justifiable distrust; he keeps showing up late for meetings and vampire-killing gigs.Fet has managed to purchase a rogue nuke (it&rsquo;s wrapped in garbage bags and looks like a trashcan), and the resistance fighters have a sacred book that may&mdash;if deciphered&mdash;lead them to the Black Site where the Master&rsquo;s earthly life began. If they can destroy that holy soil, they believe the vampire plague will end.There&rsquo;s a certain amount of perhaps dispensable hugger-mugger about vampires in Rome and archangels in Sodom, but the main attractions here are the resistance fighters&rsquo; fierce dedication to their cause, and Eph Goodweather&rsquo;s slow and painful realization that if he destroys the Master, he may also destroy his son Zachary, the last person on earth he truly loves. Heroes of tragic dimension are rare in popular fiction, but Goodweather fills the bill nicely.After a small (and perhaps unavoidable&mdash;see Tolkein&rsquo;s The Two Towers) letdown inThe Fall,The StrainTrilogy comes to a rip-roaring conclusion inThe Night Eternal. The action is non-stop, and the fantasy element is anchored in enough satisfying detail to make it believable. All the New York landmarks, such as Central Park&rsquo;s Belvedere Castle and The Cloisters, are real. And while you&rsquo;re discovering such essential vampire facts as the undead&rsquo;s inability to cross running water without human help, you&rsquo;ll also find out that the stone lions outside the New York Public Library have names: Patience and Fortitude. Plus, come on, admit it&mdash;there&rsquo;s something about seeing vampires massing for an attack in a Wendy&rsquo;s parking lot that makes them more real. The devil&rsquo;s in the details, and this is one devilishly good read full of satisfying scares. --Stephen King",

Drew assures Alice that the owner will be hands off, allowing her to run the gallery on her own. Her friends think it sounds too good to be true, but Alice sees a perfect opportunity to make a name for herself beyond the shadow of her famous father, an award-winning and controversial film maker.Everything is perfect until the morning Alice arrives at work to find the gallery gone&mdash;the space stripped bare as if it had never existed&mdash;and Drew Campbell&rsquo;s dead body on the floor. Overnight, Alice&rsquo;s dream job has vanished, and she finds herself at the center of police attention with nothing to prove her innocence. The phone number Drew gave her links back to a disposable phone.The artist whose work she displayed doesn&rsquo;t seem to exist. And the dead man she claims is Drew has been identified as someone else.When police discover ties between the gallery and a missing girl, Alice knows she&rsquo;s been set up. Now she has to prove it&mdash;a dangerous search for answers that will entangle her in a dark, high-tech criminal conspiracy and force her to unearth long-hidden secrets involving her own family&hellip; secrets that could cost Alice her life.Amazon Exclusive: Michael Connelly ReviewsLong GoneMichael Connelly&rsquo;s Edgar Award-winning first novel,The Black Echo, was published in 1992 and based in part on a true crime that had occurred in Los Angeles. Since then he has written more than 18 novels, the most recent of which isThe Fifth Witness.You know how the song goes--&ldquo;If I can make it here, I&rsquo;ll make it anywhere.&rdquo; The anthem for a city and a state of mind, powered by the voice of its own son, Frank Sinatra, even if technically he came from across the river.New York, New York. It is truly the first song on the soundtrack of the city. And it points up the risk and reward of living in the greatest city in the world.Well, what about the risks and rewards in writing a novel about the greatest city in the world? To me the challenge would be intimidating, even daunting, before I got the first word down on the first page. But not to Alafair Burke. WithLong Goneshe makes the city her own. She takes New York with a knowing and confident hand, folding its teeming streets into character and plot in a story that is never less than gripping.At center you have Alice Humphrey. She is the daughter of privilege in a city that doesn&rsquo;t pay much mind to that privilege. She&rsquo;s on her own and that is the beating heart of this book. Alice on her own. Burke constructs this book with the precision of a watchmaker. It is a contraption piece that closes tightly around Alice and then we are with her as she investigates the set up and finds her way to safety.I am familiar with most of Burke&rsquo;s work and I think Alice is her best heroine yet. She connects with us on so many levels. She is an everywoman cornered by forces she doesn&rsquo;t recognize or understand in a city with too many back alleys and secrets to ever know.  She is from a family that holds secrets from her as well as the world. But no matter. She is relentless in her pursuit of the truth, whichever way it is finally told. And in that we connect to her, admire her, like her. We feel for Alice Humphrey and want to be there when she sees it all through.That is the writer&rsquo;s most difficult task, building the bridge of empathy between reader and protagonist. Burke does it here with a character who is persistent in simply refusing to be a victim. Don&rsquo;t we all wish we were the same.Though any writer will flat out tell you that the easier it looks the harder it is to get on the page, Alafair Burke makes this one look like a walk in the park. Frank Sinatra would certainly be proud. Start spreading the news.",

Juneau is training to be the next Sage and strengthening her mystical abilities. When her entire clan is kidnapped, she sets out to find them. She soon learns that men are searching for her, and she struggles to stay one step ahead of them while acclimating to modern civilization for the first time. In a parallel narrative, Miles, the son of one of Juneau's pursuers, decides to track her himself, hoping to impress his father. The fast-paced plot, rife with mystery, successfully moves the story forward. The initial setting of Juneau's camp is fully realized and portrayed in vivid detail. She is a tough, loyal, and smart protagonist and thoroughly developed while Miles is more two-dimensional. A romance develops between them, but some teens may question Juneau's interest in Miles, who is egocentric and has few redeeming qualities. Some plot devices feel contrived, straining readers' abilities to suspend disbelief, and the number of conveniently fortuitous coincidences may raise an eyebrow or two. Ultimately, however, the unique premise, strong protagonist, and action-packed story redeem the work. Fans of postapocalyptic fiction will enjoy this unusual not-quite-dystopian novel with a dose of corporate espionage.

        "0099450259": "Mark Haddon's bitterly funny debut novel,The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, is a murder mystery of sorts--one told by an autistic version of Adrian Mole. Fifteen-year-old Christopher John Francis Boone is mathematically gifted and socially hopeless, raised in a working-class home by parents who can barely cope with their child's quirks. He takes everything that he sees (or is told) at face value, and is unable to sort out the strange behavior of his elders and peers.Late one night, Christopher comes across his neighbor's poodle, Wellington, impaled on a garden fork. Wellington's owner finds him cradling her dead dog in his arms, and has him arrested. After spending a night in jail, Christopher resolves--against the objection of his father and neighbors--to discover just who has murdered Wellington. He is encouraged by Siobhan, a social worker at his school, to write a book about his investigations, and the result--quirkily illustrated, with each chapter given its own prime number--isThe Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time.Haddon's novel is a startling performance. This is the sort of book that could turn condescending, or exploitative, or overly sentimental, or grossly tasteless very easily, but Haddon navigates those dangers with a sureness of touch that is extremely rare among first-time novelists.The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Timeis original, clever, and genuinely moving: this one is a must-read.--Jack Illingworth, Amazon.ca--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

        "0062236679": "*Starred Review* This is the story of how best-selling novelist Patchett (State of Wonder, 2011) became a writer. As a young child in California and, after her parents&#x2019; divorce, Nashville, she knew she had to write, and she was fortunate, as she so warmly and vividly explains, in her writing teachers&#x2014;Allan Gurganus, Grace Paley, and Russell Banks&#x2014;and in her success supporting herself by writing nonfiction for magazines and newspapers, beginning with Seventeen and extending to the New York Times Magazine, GQ, Vogue, and Gourmet. Patchett now assembles a retrospective set of 22 sterling personal essays to form an episodic, piquant, instructive, and entertaining self-portrait. She reflects on her family, life on a Tennessee farm, literary discipline and inspiration, and her failed first marriage. Her second marriage is central to her hilarious account of an RV road trip, and the full measure of Patchett&#x2019;s toughness and daring surfaces in &#x201C;The Wall,&#x201D; a riveting account of her father, a captain when he retired after 30 years on the Los Angeles police force, coaching her as she takes the grueling admission test for the Los Angeles Police Academy. A self-described &#x201C;workhorse&#x201D; who has even opened an independent bookstore, Patchett is a commanding and incisive storyteller, whether her tales are true or imagined. --Donna Seaman",

        "0060755814": "Product DescriptionIt is the spring of 2002 and a perfect storm has hit Boston. Across the city's archdiocese, trusted priests have been accused of the worst possible betrayal of the souls in their care. InFaith, Jennifer Haigh explores the fallout for one devout family, the McGanns.Estranged for years from her difficult and demanding relatives, Sheila McGann has remained close to her older brother Art, the popular, dynamic pastor of a large suburban parish. When Art finds himself at the center of the maelstrom, Sheila returns to Boston, ready to fight for him and his reputation. What she discovers is more complicated than she imagined. Her strict, lace-curtain-Irish mother is living in a state of angry denial. Sheila's younger brother Mike, to her horror, has already convicted his brother in his heart. But most disturbing of all is Art himself, who persistently dodges Sheila's questions and refuses to defend himself.As the scandal forces long-buried secrets to surface,Faithexplores the corrosive consequences of one family's history of silence&mdash;and the resilience its members ultimately find in forgiveness. Throughout, Haigh demonstrates how the truth can shatter our deepest beliefs&mdash;and restore them. A gripping, suspenseful tale of one woman's quest for the truth,Faithis a haunting meditation on loyalty and family, doubt and belief. Elegantly crafted, sharply observed, this is Jennifer Haigh's most ambitious novel to date.A Q&amp;A with Author Jennifer HaighQ:What was your inspiration for writingFaith?Haigh:When I moved to Boston from Iowa in 2002, the city was reeling from revelations that Catholic priests had molested children, and that the Archdiocese had covered up the abuse. I was reeling too:  I was raised in a Catholic family, spent twelve years in parochial schools and had extremely fond memories of my interactions with Catholic clergy. It&rsquo;s no exaggeration to say that nuns and priests were the heroes of my childhood.  Like many people, I was horrified by what had happened in Boston--and, as later became clear, in Catholic dioceses across the country.Faithwas my attempt to explain the inexplicable, to understand what I couldn&rsquo;t make sense of in any other way.Q:Exploring the interplay between parents and children and among siblings is a delicate art that is not easily mastered, even for seasoned writers. How do you, as a storyteller, work to keep your story emotionally evocative&mdash;pulling the reader in with a depth of feeling&mdash;without falling into melodrama or treacle?Haigh:I don&rsquo;t try to make the reader feel any particular way. I just try to be accurate, to show people as they are.Q:Faithis told from the point of view of Art&rsquo;s sister, Sheila. It&rsquo;s a surprising choice, since she doesn&rsquo;t actually witness the events in question. Why did you approach the story in this way?Haigh:It took me a while to figure out how to tell this story.  When I read account of priests who&rsquo;d been accused of sexual abuse, I was struck by the difficulty of getting to the bottom of such cases. Often it comes down to one person&rsquo;s word against another:   only two people know for sure what happened, and sometimes the child is too traumatized to remember it clearly.  As Sheila tells the story, she&rsquo;s struggling to arrive at the truth, to find out whether her brother could possibly have done the things he&rsquo;s accused of, to imagine what he thought and felt, to get inside his head. In a sense, it mirrors the way all novels are written.  To me, writing is an exercise in empathy.Q:Over the course of four novels, you&rsquo;ve broadened your skills and honed your narrative dexterity, from the exquisite character sketches ofMrs. Kimble, to broader questions of family, religion, and society in the rich, multi-layered family drama that isFaith. What are you working on next?Haigh:My current project is a collection of short stories set in Bakerton, the Pennsylvania coal town where my second novel,Baker Towers, took place.Q:What inspires you as a writer&mdash;and as a reader?  Who has influenced your writing and who you are as a person?Haigh:Like all writers, I am a reader first. When my work is going well, I read. When it&rsquo;s going badly, I read more. Faulkner, William Styron, James Salter, Alice Munro, William Trevor, Richard Yates, JM Coetzee:  these are writers whose books remind me what&rsquo;s possible, why I wanted to write novels in the first place.--This text refers to theHardcoveredition.",

        "0061659223": "Gr 9 Up&ndash;This title, the penultimate installment of the series, focuses on Ani, daughter of Gabriel, the leader of the Dark Court's Wild Hunt; and Devlin, brother of Sorcha, the Queen of the High Court, as the faerie world tips closer to the brink of war. Bananach wants to kill Ani, and Devlin has been secretly protecting her since she was a child. When Ani's and Devlin's paths finally cross, they feel an instant attraction, which pits Bananach and Devlin against each other. Meanwhile Sorcha pines for Seth while he spends six months of the year in the mortal world as a faerie trying to rekindle his relationship with Aislinn. Since each book in the series focuses on a different main character, the cast has gotten somewhat large and confusing. Once readers have gotten reacclimatized to Marr's faerie world, though, they will find that the story moves at a rapid pace. Ani and Devlin are fully fleshed-out characters, and their attraction to one another is believable. While the author's world-building is fairly solid, the fact that time runs six times faster in faerie than it does in the mortal world (as established in Fragile Eternity) is never addressed in this book. However, this is a worthy addition to a fine series. Readers who have enjoyed the early books will find this a satisfying read, and will be eager for the series conclusion.Kristin Anderson, Columbus Metropolitan Library System, OH&copy; Copyright 2010.

For everyone else, it was perfect hell. InThe Perfect Storm, author  Sebastian Junger conjures for the reader the meteorological conditions that created the  &quot;storm of the century&quot; and the impact the storm had on many of the people  caught in it. Chief among these are the six crew members of the swordfish boat theAndrea Gail, all of whom were lost 500 miles from home beneath roiling seas  and high waves. Working from published material, radio dialogues, eyewitness accounts,  and the experiences of people who have survived similar events, Junger attempts to re-create the last moments of theAndrea Gailas well as the perilous high-seas  rescues of other victims of the storm.Like a Greek drama,The Perfect Stormbuilds slowly and inexorably to its tragic  climax. The book weaves the history of the fishing industry and the science of predicting  storms into the quotidian lives of those aboard theAndrea Gailand of others who  would soon find themselves in the fury of the storm.

But his girlfriend Caitlin deserved it--hadn't she defied him by singing in the school talent show when he had forbidden her to display herself like that? Even though he'd told her that everybody would laugh at her because she couldn't sing and was a fat slob? Both were lies. Because Caitlin was so beautiful, the only person who understood him. Out of his desperate need for her came all the mean words and the hitting. But now Caitlin's family has procured a restraining order to keep Nick away, and the judge has sentenced him to Mario Ortega's Family Violence class, to sit around every week with six other angry guys who hit their girlfriends. And to write a journal explaining how he got into this mess.Other teen novels--most strikinglyDreamlandby Sarah Dessen--have shown dating violence from the point of view of a young girl trapped in an abusive relationship, but inBreathing Underwater, first-time novelist Alex Flinn tackles the difficult task of making us understand, if not sympathize with, the motivation of a violent young man. The story, like Rob Thomas's stylistically similarRats Saw God, proceeds in two different time frames: the journal in which Nick relives the course of his tender but stormy love affair with Caitlin and the time after the restraining order, in which a desperate and friendless Nick struggles to understand and overcome his anger. This extraordinarily moving novel is highly relevant reading for all young men in our violence-prone society.

        "B0009VXAM0": "As DVD playback made the PlayStation 2 more than just a game machine, hefty multi-media features make the Sony PlayStation 3 an even more versatile home entertainment machine. Features such as video chat, Internet access, digital photo viewing, and digital audio and video will likely make it the central component of your media set-up. Still, it is first and foremost a game console--a powerful one at that.Under the HoodThe PS3 features IBM's \"Cell\" processor and a co-developed Nvidia graphics processor that makes the system able to perform two trillion calculations per second. That's approximately 320 times more calculations per second than the PS2. Along with the traditional AV and composite connections, it also boasts an HDMI port, which delivers uncompressed, unconverted digital picture and sound to compatible high-definition TV and projectors. The system is capable of 128-bit pixel precision and 1080p resolution for a full HD experience.PlayStation 3: Tower of powerA sleek new lookWith the wireless, motion-sensitive controllerBlu-Ray is the New WaySony's PlayStation 3 games are encoded onto the Blu-Ray disc media format, which can hold six times as much data as traditional DVDs. This increase in capacity--combined with the awesome power of its processor and graphics card--promises mind-blowing games once developers have learned how to fully harness the new console's power. The PS3 will also support CD-ROM, CD-RW, DVD, DVD-ROM, DVD-R, DVD+R formats.In addition, PlayStation 3 system software update version 2.20 and up includesBD Live support. With this you can now play discs that support Blu-ray Disc Profile 2.0 (BD-LIVE) and you can also connect to the Internet while playing discs that support this format so that you can obtain additional features. Features that are available vary depending on the software in use.Sensational ControllerNew gamers intuitively move the controller while playing, even though that movement has traditionally had no relation to what's going on in the game. Sony has picked up on this tendency and is using it to bring a new level of control into the PS3. Inside the controller is a high-precision six-axis sensing system that accurately detects fine movements in pitch, roll, and yaw, as well as three dimensions of movement, to control games. This means that future PS3 games will be controlled by the movements of your hands rather than just your thumbs. For example, you might be able to steer a car by holding the controller like a steering wheel.While the PS3 controller looks much like its Dual Shock predecessors, it will lack the force-feedback vibration since that would only interfere with the sensing system. It uses Bluetooth 2.0 wireless technology and can support up to seven wireless controllers at a time. It's a hot-swappable system, so if your controller is running low on power, just pause your game and connect a USB 2.0 cable. You can continue playing while your controller recharges automatically.Plays All PlayStation GamesThe PlayStation 3 will be backward compatible with PlayStation and PlayStation 2 games, which means you'll be able to play all your favorite games without keeping all the old systems. The console will have slots for Memory Stick Duo, an SD slot and a Compact Flash memory slot. It comes with a pre-installed hard disc drive, which allows you to save games as well as download content from the Internet.Gran Turismo HDResistance: Fall of ManA Slew of New GamesA whole host of game publishers are already backing the PS3 and several have even confirmed games for the console. At the 2006 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), more than 30 titles were displayed for the system, includingGran Turismo HD,Resistance: Fall of Man, andFinal Fantasy XIII. Previously announced titles includeMetal Gear Solid 4,Devil May Cry 4andTekken 6.OnlineSony has stated that the PS3 will have similar online connectivity and services as the next generation of Xbox Live. Calling it \"an always on, always connected device,\" SCEI's chief technical officer Masa Chatani said the PS3 would be constantly in touch with a \"PlayStation World\" network \"fundamentally based on community, communication commerce, and content.\" Technically, the infrastructure is there to make that connection. The PS3 supports 10BASE-T, 100BASE-TX, 1000BASE-T Ethernet, as well as IEEE 802.11 b/g wireless networking protocols.",

The novel alternates between Harry's sleuthing and a Croatian assassin's attempt to evade him long enough to escape the city. John Lee selects a properly surly and world-weary voice for Harry, and an accented, desperate one for the killer known as the little redeemer.

But her dark, clever, scheming sister, Anne, insinuates herself into Henry's graces, styling herself as his adviser and confidant. Soon she displaces Mary as his lover and begins her machinations to rid him of his wife, Katherine of Aragon. This is only the beginning of the intrigue that Gregory so handily chronicles, capturing beautifully the mingled hate and nearly incestuous love Anne, Mary and George (\"kin and enemies all at once\") feel for each other and the toll their family's ambition takes on them. Mary, the story's narrator, is the most sympathetic of the siblings, but even she is twisted by the demands of power and status; charming George, an able plotter, finally brings disaster on his own head by falling in love with a male courtier. Anne, most tormented of all, is ruthless in her drive to become queen, and then to give Henry a male heir. Rather than settling for a picturesque rendering of court life, Gregory conveys its claustrophobic, all-consuming nature with consummate skill. In the end, Anne's famous, tragic end is offset by Mary's happier fate, but the self-defeating folly of the quest for power lingers longest in the reader's mind.Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an alternatePaperbackedition.",
        "0060392991": "Frankly, this literary critic didn't expect Mick Foley's memoir of his life as Mankind (and his other wrestling personas, Cactus Jack and Dude Love) to hit No. 1 on Amazon.com's hardcover nonfiction bestseller list in its first literary bout. The cover is cluttered and confusing, and do we really need 500-plus pages of Foley's boasts? Yes. Foley gives his all for his calling, and he burns to tell his adventures. Take the famous tale of how he lost most of his ear (the bloody result is depicted in the 16-page color-photo section). It was in his 1994 bouts with Vader (Leon White): after getting a broken nose, a dislocated jaw, and 21 stitches in the first match, Foley did his \"hangman\" routine, wherein he catches his neck between the second and third ropes and spins them into a twist. \"The end result is the illusion of a man being hanged by his neck while his body kicks and writhes in an attempt to get out... the man actuallyishanging by his neck and the body reallydoeskick and writhe in an attempt to get out.\" Unfortunately, in the prior match, Too Cold Scorpio had had the officials tighten the ropes, so Foley tore off his ear to avoid death by strangulation, like \"a fox that chews off its paw to escape a trap.\" Foley also wrestles on 10,000-thumbtack mats with barbwire ropes and C-4 explosives, and earns the ultimate compliment: \"The fans really like the way you bleed.\" Many fans also like the way his gory story reads.--Tim Appelo",
        "0060280778": "\"Monster\" is what the prosecutor called 16-year-old Steve Harmon for his supposed role in the fatal shooting of a convenience-store owner. But was Steve really the lookout who gave the \"all clear\" to the murderer, or was he just in the wrong place at the wrong time? In this innovative novel by Walter Dean Myers, the reader becomes both juror and witness during the trial of Steve's life. To calm his nerves as he sits in the courtroom, aspiring filmmaker Steve chronicles the proceedings in movie script format.  Interspersed throughout his screenplay are journal writings that provide insight into Steve's life before the murder and his feelings about being held in prison during the trial. \"They take away your shoelaces and your belt so you can't kill yourself no matter how bad it is. I guess making you live is part of the punishment.\"Myers, known for the inner-city classicMotown and Didi(first  published in 1984), proves withMonsterthat he has kept up with both the struggles and the lingo of today's teens. Steve is an adolescent caught up in the violent circumstances of an adult world--a situation most teens can relate to on some level. Readers will no doubt  be attracted to the novel's handwriting-style typeface, emphasis on dialogue, and fast-paced courtroom action. By weaving together Steve's journal entries and his script, Myers has given the first-person voice a new twist and added yet another worthy volume to his already admirable body of work.

        "006000438X": "The title of Manil Suri's first novel gets right to the point. His protagonist, having purchased the right to sleep on the ground-floor landing of a Bombay apartment house, slips slowly from a coma into death. As this aging alcoholic takes leave of the earth, his neighbors surround him, arguing over who gave Vishnu a few dried chapatis, who called the doctor for him, and who will pay for the ambulance to cart him away. Meanwhile, the hero ofThe Death of Vishnuis lost in memories. Drifting through increasingly vivid scenes from his past, he recalls his relatively rare snatches of love and joy--and especially his romance with Padmini, a self-involved prostitute. On one particular day, it seems, he stole one of his employer's cars and drove his love interest to the honeymoon town of Lonavala, where he showered her with gifts and finally lifted her veil to kiss her like a bride:Then the absurdity of the situation strikes him. The preposterousness of his images, the foolishness of his feelings, the comicality of chasing currents that skim across Padmini's face. He thinks how absurd this whole trip has been, how absurd is the presence of the two of them in Lonavala, how absurd is the scenery itself that stretches before them. He thinks of poor, ridiculous Mr. Jalal, waiting back in Bombay for his Fiat, and of how Padmini will react when he asks her to buy them petrol so they can get back.Vishnu also recalls his secret passion for Kavita Asrani, the beautiful teenage daughter of one of the families for whom he works. Given the protagonist's focus on his hapless love life, the scope of Suri's dazzling debut may appear narrow. However, the apartment house upon whose floor Vishnu spends his final hours functions as a microcosm of Indian society. It helps to know even a smattering about Hindu mythology or India's religious conflicts. But even if you don't, there is plenty to relish inThe Death of Vishnu, with its comical, richly drawn characters, loving attention to the details of everyday life, and provocative exploration of destiny and free will.--Regina Marler--This text refers to theHardcoveredition.",

But  when Ray arrives the judge is already dead, and the one-page document dividing  his meager estate between the two sons seems crystal clear.

It's a slender plot to  hang a thriller on, and in truth it's not John Grisham's best in terms of  pacing, dramatic tension, and interesting characters (except for Harry Rex, a  country lawyer who was the judge's closest friend and in many ways is the father  Ray wishes he'd had.

        "0060838728": "In an unnamed South American country, a world-renowned soprano sings at a birthday party in honor of a visiting Japanese industrial titan. His hosts hope that Mr. Hosokawa can be persuaded to build a factory in their Third World backwater. Alas, in the opening sequence, just as the accompanist kisses the soprano, a ragtag band of 18 terrorists enters the vice-presidential mansion through the air conditioning ducts. Their quarry is the president, who has unfortunately stayed home to watch a favorite soap opera. And thus, from the beginning, things go awry.Among the hostages are not only Hosokawa and Roxane Coss, the American soprano, but an assortment of Russian, Italian, and French diplomatic types. Reuben Iglesias, the diminutive and gracious vice president, quickly gets sideways of the kidnappers, who have no interest in him whatsoever. Meanwhile, a Swiss Red Cross negotiator named Joachim Messner is roped into service while vacationing. He comes and goes, wrangling over terms and demands, and the days stretch into weeks, the weeks into months.With the omniscience of magic realism, Ann Patchett flits in and out of the hearts and psyches of hostage and terrorist alike, and in doing so reveals a profound, shared humanity. Her voice is suitably lyrical, melodic, full of warmth and compassion. Hearing opera sung live for the first time, a young priest reflects:Never had he thought, never once, that such a woman existed, one who stood so close to God that God's own voice poured from her. How far she must have gone inside herself to call up that voice. It was as if the voice came from the center part of the earth and by the sheer effort and diligence of her will she had pulled it up through the dirt and rock and through the floorboards of the house, up into her feet, where it pulled through her, reaching, lifting, warmed by her, and then out of the white lily of her throat and straight to God in heaven.Joined by no common language except music, the 58 international hostages and their captors forge unexpected bonds. Time stands still, priorities rearrange themselves. Ultimately, of course, something has to give, even in a novel so imbued with the rich imaginative potential of magic realism.

        "0060772913": "What's a homicide detective to do when tracking down a female serial killer who targets her victims via online dating sites? In Gibson's breezy, formulaic new romance set in Boise, Idaho, said detective&mdash;handsome Quinn McIntyre&mdash;logs online and goes out on numerous first dates until he pinpoints the woman wacko enough to have committed the crimes. So begins the relationship between Quinn and Lucy Rothschild, a well-educated, 30-something professional who fits the killer's profile. Quinn isn't the only one with an agenda, however. Lucy, a mystery writer, is doing research for her next novel, which coincidentally features a female serial killer and Internet dating. Mutual lust impedes both Quinn and Lucy's plans, and miscommunication and the real serial killer serve as speed bumps on their path to love. While Gibson's fast-paced romp is mildly entertaining, her flimsy plot doesn't hold up to scrutiny, and her protagonists&mdash;the capable detective who's married to his work and the smart female who's been burned by a parade of Mr. Wrongs&mdash;never grow beyond their prescribed roles.(Feb.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She \"rodated\" desperately, searching for someone to repair her wounded ego. She even found a reasonably suitable boyfriend-only she broke it off when he suggested living together. At one point she faced the truth she'd avoided from the beginning, that she had to learn to appreciate herself for her own accomplishments before she could have a healthy relationship with a man. While there's nothing new about that story line-indeed, it's curiously proto-feminist for a recent Barnard grad-Klein's sense of humor is downright wicked. Her ex-mother-in-law was a \"shrub of a woman\" who \"sounded like she'd swallowed a southerner\" and looked \"like a transvestite who had a one-night stand with a disco ball.\" Then there's \"Mr. Madras Pants,\" who \"carried a degree in poplin with a minor in seersucker... the type of man who was at complete ease when sending his order back to the kitchen.\" In the end, Klein's is a great, fun read.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0062009494": "*Starred Review* On a stormy night in early Victorian London, an able young man named Dodger rises from the sewers in response to a scream, fights off two thugs, and rescues a damsel in distress. Dodger continues to rise throughout the novel, as his love for the mysterious lady motivates this tosher (scavenger for lost coins and other treasures in London&#x2019;s sewers) to elevate himself and leads him to a closer acquaintance with a string of historical figures, including Dickens, Disraeli, and ultimately, the queen and her consort. While most writers would be well advised not to include such characters in their books, Pratchett manages to humanize them without diminishing them or throwing the story off-kilter. However lowly Dodger&#x2019;s origins, he remains the most memorable character in the book. Living by his wits and unencumbered by conventional morality, this trickster hero expertly navigates the underbelly of his city as he carries out a bizarre scheme resulting in justice and mercy. The temptation to quote sentences, whole paragraphs, and possibly entire chapters is almost irresistible, because the pleasure of reading the novel is in the language as much as in the characters and well-researched period setting. Often amusing, this Victorian romp of a novel is lovingly crafted and completely enjoyable. Grades 8-12. --Carolyn Phelan",

Those familiar with the earlier work of Ehrman, a distinguished professor of religious studies at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and author of more than 20 books including Misquoting Jesus, will not be surprised at the content of this one. Written in a manner accessible to nonspecialists, Ehrman argues that many books of the New Testament are not simply written by people other than the ones to whom they are attributed, but that they are deliberate forgeries. The word itself connotes scandal and crime, and&nbsp;it appears on nearly every page. Indeed, this book takes on an idea widely accepted by biblical scholars: that writing in someone else's name was common practice and perfectly okay in ancient times. Ehrman argues that it was not even then&nbsp;considered acceptable&mdash;hence, a forgery. While many readers may wish for more evidence of&nbsp;the charge, Ehrman's introduction to the arguments and debates among different religious communities during the first few centuries and among&nbsp;the early Christians themselves, though not the book's main point, is especially valuable.

        "0060883529": "Product DescriptionJane Leavy, the acclaimed author of theNew York TimesbestsellerSandy Koufax: A Lefty's Legacy, returns with a biography of an American original&mdash;number 7, Mickey Mantle. Drawing on more than 500 interviews with friends and family, teammates, and opponents, she delivers the definitive account of Mantle's life, mining the mythology of The Mick for the true story of a luminous and illustrious talent with an achingly damaged soul.Meticulously reported and elegantly written,The Last Boyis a baseball tapestry that weaves together episodes from the author's weekend with The Mick in Atlantic City, where she interviewed her hero in 1983, after he was banned from baseball, with reminiscences from friends and family of the boy from Commerce, Oklahoma, who would lead the Yankees to seven world championships, be voted the American League's Most Valuable Player three times, win the Triple Crown in 1956, and duel teammate Roger Maris for Babe Ruth's home run crown in the summer of 1961&mdash;the same boy who would never grow up.As she did so memorably in her biography of Sandy Koufax, Jane Leavy transcends the hyperbole of hero worship to reveal the man behind the coast-to-coast smile, who grappled with a wrenching childhood, crippling injuries, and a genetic predisposition to alcoholism. InThe Last Boyshe chronicles her search to find out more about the person he was and, given what she discovers, to explain his mystifying hold on a generation of baseball fans, who were seduced by that lopsided, gap-toothed grin. It is an uncommon biography, with literary overtones: not only a portrait of an icon, but an investigation of memory itself. How long was the Tape Measure Home Run? Did Mantle swing the same way right-handed and left-handed? What really happened to his knee in the 1951 World Series? What happened to the red-haired, freckle-faced boy known back home as Mickey Charles?\"I believe in memory, not memorabilia,\" Leavy writes in her preface. But inThe Last Boy, she discovers that what we remember of our heroes&mdash;and even what they remember of themselves&mdash;is only where the story begins.Amazon Q&amp;A: Bill Madden Interviews Jane LeavyFor more than 30 yearsBill Maddenhas covered the Yankees and Major League Baseball for theNew York Daily News. The author of several books about the Yankees, includingSteinbrenner: The Last Lion of Baseball, Madden is also the 2010 recipient of the Baseball Hall of Fame's J.G. Taylor Spink Award.Madden:Your best-selling biography of Sandy Koufax was a tour de force, partly because Koufax was a very private man whose life story had never really been told before. Mickey Mantle&rsquo;s life is quite the opposite, it&rsquo;s been in the subject of a spate of different &ldquo;autobiographies,&rdquo; some of which he even wrote. Under those circumstances, what made you want to take up another book about him?Leavy:Originally, I wanted to write about Willie, Mickey and The Duke in New York in the Fifties. The publisher said, &ldquo;Do The Mick. Everybody loves The Mick.&rdquo; I was wary because so much had been written about him&mdash;he left a paper trail as long as the drive from Commerce, Oklahoma to the Bronx, so I didn&rsquo;t expect to learn that he&rsquo;d been raised by a den of Alaskan she-wolves. My challenge was to strip away all the layers of myth that had accumulated and let Mickey breathe. And he, of all people, was my worst source. For example: the knee surgery he said he had after tripping over a drain in the 1951 World Series trying not to run into Joe DiMaggio in centerfield. In fact, he didn&rsquo;t have surgery until two years later. I only learned that because I went through every day of theNew York Timesfrom October 1951 to November 1953 looking for the date the knife fell! That&rsquo;s why this book took five years and nearly 600 interviews. I wanted to try to understand why after all these years, and all these revelations, Mickey Mantle still means so much to so many people&mdash;including me&mdash;and the first step was to get the basic facts straight.Madden:You make the point early on in the book that Mickey was a childhood hero, but you also have a recurring sequence in the book of your first interview with him in Atlantic City in 1983, where&mdash;at one point&mdash;he drunkenly makes a pass at you. What lingering effect did this have on how you ultimately approached your book?Leavy:I was plenty nervous when I met him. Mickey was my hero. But, he was also a very particular kind of role model. I was born two months prematurely (in a hospital a mile from Yankee Stadium) and came with some of the flaws that afflict those who don&rsquo;t incubate as long as we&rsquo;re supposed to. Mickey taught me how to function with pain and without complaint&mdash;his triumphs were mine. I was devastated with how he acted. After I&rsquo;d taken his hand from my knee, I called the only person I could think of still awake at that hour, a new mother, who basically told me to grow up.The next morning, over breakfast, I vented my anger and disappointment, railing at him for, among other things, greeting my youthful autograph request with flatulence. He was stunned and remorseful, albeit in a hilariously idiosyncratic manner. He gave me an 8 x 10 glossy that said, &ldquo;Sorry, I farted, your friend, Mick.&rdquo; For a moment, I felt I saw behind his crude fa&ccedil;ade. I decided the only way I could write this book was to acknowledge my lack of dispassion and scrutinize him completely. That&rsquo;s what happened that weekend in Atlantic City. It forced me to see the world as it was, not how I wanted it to be.Madden:One of the people I wish I'd been able to interview for my Steinbrenner book was Mantle, if only because I detected a very strained relationship between the two of them. Steinbrenner made a point to deify DiMaggio and had memorial services for Joe, Billy Martin, Roger Maris and Mel Allen, but did nothing for Mickey when he died. In your conversations with Mickey did he ever talk about Steinbrenner and anything that might have led to ill feelings toward each other?Leavy:When I told Mantle I&rsquo;d heard the Boss was thinking of turning Monument Park in centerfield into a water park for the disadvantaged youth of the South Bronx, Mantle was completely incredulous. He told me, &ldquo;It was 480 in centerfield when I played. It&rsquo;s 420 now and he&rsquo;s talking about bringing them in farther,&rdquo; and shook his head. &ldquo;I was at a banquet one time and I said to him, &lsquo;they ought to let those boys throw the ball up and hit it.&rsquo; That pissed him off.&rdquo;Mantle was interested in Yankee history&mdash;he grilled a friend who saw Babe Ruth lying in state in the rotunda at the Stadium about what it was like to be there that day. But I don&rsquo;t think he had a whole lot of patience with &ldquo;Yankeeography.&rdquo; It was a quick disillusionment. When he signed with the Yankees, reporters asked which Yankee had been his childhood hero. He said, &ldquo;Stan Musial.&rdquo; George Weiss, the general manager, immediately &ldquo;corrected&rdquo; his memory and from then on Joe D. was his hero. Furthermore, I think he was deeply disappointed with the baseball community&rsquo;s response&mdash;or lack of response&mdash;when commissioner Bowie Kuhn banned him in 1983 because of his affiliation with the Claridge Hotel and Casino, a job he had taken to pay for his son Billy&rsquo;s treatment for non-Hodgkin&rsquo;s Lymphoma. He told me, &ldquo;I feel really kind of bad no one took up for me.&rdquo; By &ldquo;no one&rdquo; I was pretty sure he meant Steinbrenner. The Yankees did little more than observe a moment of silence when Mantle died.Madden:It would seem that most everybody pertinent to the book cooperated with you, especially the Mantle family. I was grateful for the cooperation I had from George Steinbrenner&rsquo;s friends and associates when I wroteSteinbrenner, but I had an advantage that you didn&rsquo;t in that most of them knew me personally and, I suppose, trusted me. As a stranger, did you meet any significant resistance?Leavy:Danny and David Mantle&mdash;Mickey&rsquo;s sons&mdash;and their late mother, Merlyn&mdash;were extremely generous with their recollections and insights. Their openness about their lives and their relationship with their father was extraordinary. Like him, they are extremely honest. There&rsquo;s no put on, as folks in Commerce, Oklahoma like to say. I hope they&rsquo;ll come away from the book with a deeper understanding of the forces that formed him and contributed to his downfall, but I don&rsquo;t know how they&rsquo;ll react.Madden:This is the definitive &ldquo;warts and all&rdquo; biography of Mickey, with heavy emphasis on all of his demons. How do you think Mickey himself would feel about the book?Leavy:I think it&rsquo;s an honest book and Mantle was a very honest man. I don&rsquo;t see this is as a dark book. I hope it&rsquo;s enlightening in the most literal sense of the word and I hope that critics&mdash;and readers at large&mdash;will agree. I think the tragedy of Mantle is that he had so little time, at the beginning of his baseball career, and at the beginning of his sober life, to be his best self. He was a decent man who was genetically pre-disposed to alcoholism and enabled his whole life by the trappings of his celebrity. That&rsquo;s his story. As Billy Crystal told me about his movie,61*, Mickey wouldn&rsquo;t have wanted the sugar coat.His late wife, Merlyn, wrote about the sexual abuse he suffered as a young boy in the family memoir, &ldquo;A Hero All His Life&rdquo; and she elaborated on it when we spoke, as did several of his close friends. It turned out that his half sister wasn&rsquo;t his only abuser and experts tell me that many of the destructive behaviors he manifested are seen in victims of childhood sexual abuse. So, I came away with enormous compassion for him and, I hope, with an answer to the question posed by one of his minor league teammates: &ldquo;Mickey, what happened?&rdquo;",

In the late 19th century, Sir John Strachey, a senior British official, grandly opined that the territory's diverse states simply could not possess any sort of unity, physical, political, social or religious. Strachey, clearly, was wrong: India today is a unified entity and a rising global power. Even so, it continues to defy explanation. India's existence, says Guha, an internationally known scholar (Environmentalism: A Global History), has also been an anomaly for academic political science, according to whose axioms cultural heterogeneity and poverty do not make a nation, still less a democratic one. Yet India continues to exist. Guha's aim in this startlingly ambitious political, cultural and social survey is to explain why and how. He cheerfully concludes that India's continuing existence results from its unique diversity and its refusal to be pigeonholed into such conventional political models as Anglo-American liberalism, French republicanism, atheistic communism or Islamist theocracy. India is proudly sui generis, and with August 15, 2007, being the 60th anniversary of Indian independence, Guha's magisterial history of India since that day comes not a moment too soon. 32 pages of b&amp;w illus., 8 maps.(Aug.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

For his cousin, Roman, it is the vision that together they can find fortune in Liberty City, gateway to the land of opportunity. As they slip into debt and are dragged into a criminal underworld by a series of shysters, thieves and sociopaths, they discover that the reality is very different from the dream in a city that worships money and status, and is heaven for those who have them and a living nightmare for those who don&#146;t.Beginning with the 1997 release of the originalGrand Theft Auto, theGTAseries has been one of the most prolific, controversial and down right entertaining franchises in video games history. This pedigree of success guarantees that the highly anticipated eleventh game in the series,Grand Theft Auto IV, will garner at least as much attention if not more.Return to Liberty City.The dream as Niko expected it.View larger.There's always a catch.View larger.But some skills are international.View larger.The PlotGrand Theft Auto IVis a brand new adventure in theGTAuniverse following the experiences of Nikolai \"Niko\" Bellic, a new immigrant from an undisclosed eastern European country whose troubled pa  st and the persuasion of his cousin Roman have brought him to the fictional Liberty City. Unfortunately, Niko&#146;s search for the American Dream and a much needed fresh start, hits an immediate snag when the rags to riches story Roman spun to pique Niko's interest is exposed as not only a complete fabrication, but a ploy to enlist Niko&#146;s well-known skills as a tough guy against the ample list of enemies clamoring for Roman&#146;s debt-ridden blood.Because Roman is the only person Niko knows in Liberty City he begrudgingly accepts his role as Roman&#146;s protector despite the deception. But as time goes on Niko comes into his own, and his experience on the wrong side of the tracks proves more valuable than he could have ever imagined as he fights for survival and later supremacy on the crime ridden streets of Liberty City.Game EnvironmentsBased on several of the boroughs of New York City and parts of New Jersey, Liberty City, familiar to players of previous games in  the series, has been entirely redesigned forGTA IV. Players can expect visible detail down to the weeds growing in the cracks in the sidewalk, cars and buildings of visibly different ages and a much greater level if verticality in the buildings and bridges that they are able to explore as Niko moves through the city streets. In addition, pedestrians inGTA IVare much more realistic. No longer simply moving cardboard cutouts, these NPCs are intelligent, modern, human representations that laugh, cry, eat, drink, use cell phones and ATMs, and talking amongst themselves regardless of Niko&#146;s interaction with them.GameplayHistoricallyGTAgames have focused heavily on mission-based play, requiring successful completion of fixed tasks in order for players to progress through the game, but this has changed to a great extent inGTA IV. Players will experience an entirely new and exciting emphasis centered on the blending of on-mission and off-mission play, resulting not only in an increased sense of realism, but more interesting and unrestricted gameplay.FeaturesAside from the car jacking and a detailed city environment here are the new features forGTA IV:Improved combat system - Now you can use cover and also a target lock system, which allows you to take out targets with greater ease and accuracy. Plus, you can engage in some hand-to-hand combat if you can't get your hands on a piece quick enough.Cell phone - Not just for basic phone calls anymore.  Use your in-game cell phone to receive missions via SMS, snap photos, and ZiT (tag) songs that can be downloaded exclusively on Amazon.com/mp3.Free time - In between missions you can take advantage of \"me\" time.  There are gentleman's clubs, comedy clubs, bowling alleys, and bars, which all house unique activities.Take a break from the storyline - A variety of side missions allow you to help run a car service, \"borrow\" cop cars, assassinate targets, help solve problems for those on the street, or take to the air with stunt jumps that are scattered all over the city.Control your own fate - Throughout the game choice moments will arrive causing you to make a decision that will affect relationships and money.MultiplayerGive Niko a rest and create your own multiplayer \"hero.\"GTAhas added multiplayer modes allowing you to take your creation out to play online in competitive, co-op, and free form modes. Competitive mode has you fighting against the cops, jacking cars, or racing to finish odd jobs.  Co-op challenges you and your friends with various tasks including Hangman's NOOSE where you are responsible for escorting a wanted kingpin to a safe extraction point.  Freeform lets you and 15 others lose on Liberty City.  Use this mode to hit up the bar and play virtual darts versus each other or head out to the streets and set up your own drag races.

        "0099526832": "David Lurie is hardly the hero of his own life, or anyone else's. At 52, the protagonist ofDisgraceis at the end of his professional and romantic game, and seems to be deliberately courting disaster. Long a professor of modern languages at Cape Town University College, he has recently been relegated to adjunct professor of communications at the same institution, now pointedly renamed Cape Technical University:Although he devotes hours of each day to his new discipline, he finds its first premise, as enunciated in the Communications 101 handbook, preposterous: \"Human society has created language in order that we may communicate our thoughts, feelings and intentions to each other.\" His own opinion, which he does not air, is that the origins of speech lie in song, and the origins of song in the need to fill out with sound the overlarge and rather empty human soul.Twice married and twice divorced, his magnetic looks on the wane, David rather cruelly seduces one of his students, and his conduct unbecoming is soon uncovered. In his eighth novel, J.M. Coetzee might have been content to write a searching academic satire. But inDisgracehe is intent on much more, and his art is as uncompromising as his main character, though infinitely more complex. Refusing to play the public-repentance game, David gets himself fired--a final gesture of contempt. Now, he thinks, he will write something on Byron's last years. Not empty, unread criticism, \"prose measured by the yard,\" but a libretto. To do so, he heads for the Eastern Cape and his daughter's farm. In her mid-20s, Lucy has turned her back on city sophistications: with five hectares, she makes her living by growing flowers and produce and boarding dogs. \"Nothing,\" David thinks, \"could be more simple.\" But nothing, in fact, is more complicated--or, in the new South Africa, more dangerous. Far from being the refuge he has sought, little is safe in Salem. Just as David has settled into his temporary role as farmworker and unenthusiastic animal-shelter volunteer, he and Lucy are attacked by three black men. Unable to protect his daughter, David's disgrace is complete. Hers, however, is far worse.There is much more to be explored in Coetzee's painful novel, and few consolations. It would be easy to pick up on his title and viewDisgraceas a complicated working-out of personal and political shame and responsibility. But the author is concerned with his country's history, brutalities, and betrayals. Coetzee is also intent on what measure of soul and rights we allow animals. After the attack, David takes his role at the shelter more seriously, at last achieving an unlikely home and some measure of love. In Coetzee's recent Princeton lectures,The Lives of Animals, an aging novelist tells her audience that the question that occupies all lab and zoo creatures is, \"Where is home, and how do I get there?\" David, though still all-powerful compared to those he helps dispose of, is equally trapped, equally lost.Disgraceis almost willfully plain. Yet it possesses its own lean, heartbreaking lyricism, most of all in its descriptions of unwanted animals. At the start of the novel, David tells his student that poetry either speaks instantly to the reader--\"a flash of revelation and a flash of response\"--or not at all. Coetzee's book speaks differently, its layers and sadnesses endlessly unfolding.--Kerry Fried--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

When a group of renegade Union militiamen attacks the Colley home, stealing family possessions, burning everything down, and taking away her father--an apolitical judge--Adair  gathers the remnants of her clothes and mounts a rescue effort.

Thus begins Keyes's enormously entertaining fifth novel. She resurrects the \"maintenance-level dysfunctional\" Walsh family: sisters Claire (Watermelon), Rachel (Rachel's Holiday), Helen and Anna, plus a befuddled dad and hyper-as-a-hummingbird mum. Maggie, however, is the \"good\" sister, so it is especially shameful when she must slink back home. She tends to the \"mourning sickness\" over her failed marriage, which Keyes describes with surprising depth and verisimilitude, and begins fantasizing about what might have been with her first love, Shay Delaney. Accepting an invitation from her best friend, Emily, a struggling screenwriter, Maggie visits L.A., the mecca of reinvention. She decides to trade in her \"plain yogurt\" persona for that of bad girl and takes an oft-bumpy walk on the wild side, with results that are riotously and embarrassingly silly. Amid her drunken nights and poor flirting choices, she throws herself into the glittering cesspool of La-la-land: acting as Emily's assistant, she witnesses the superficial frivolity and vicious fickleness of the entertainment business. Keyes's observations may be familiar (on aura reading, fake boobs, sadistic eyebrow groomers, the dependence of social status on cars), but her cleverly hilarious approach, especially as a foreigner, keep them fresh. Although this is unquestionably a fun read, Keyes refrains from turning it into fluff and delivers a well-rounded story. Her themes of love and redemption coupled with her familiar, best-friend tone have made her wildly popular in the U.K. and, like her latest novel, should ensure her a Hollywood ending in the U.S. as well.Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

Harvey undertakes the tast because \"Women are clueless about men,\" because \"Men get away with a whole lot of stuff\" and because he has \"some valuable information to change all of that.\" Harvey makes a game effort, taking a bold but familiar men-are-dogs approach: if you're \"cutting back\" on sex, \"he will have another woman lined up and waiting to give him what he needs and wants--the cookie.\" Several chapters later, however, he introduces the \"ninety-day rule,\" asserting that, actually, he won't always have another woman lined up--and the only way to makes sure is a three-month vetting period. Harvey also tackles mama's boys, \"independent--and lonely--women,\" and the matter of children in the dating world (\"If he's meeting the kids after you decide he's the one, it's too late\").

Kingsolver's ambitious new novel, her first in nine years (after theThe Poisonwood Bible), focuses on Harrison William Shepherd, the product of a divorced American father and a Mexican mother. After getting kicked out of his American military academy, Harrison spends his formative years in Mexico in the 1930s in the household of Diego Rivera; his wife, Frida Kahlo; and their houseguest, Leon Trotsky, who is hiding from Soviet assassins. After Trotsky is assassinated, Harrison returns to the U.S., settling down in Asheville, N.C., where he becomes an author of historical potboilers (e.g.,Vassals of Majesty) and is later investigated as a possible subversive. Narrated in the form of letters, diary entries and newspaper clippings, the novel takes a while to get going, but once it does, it achieves a rare dramatic power that reaches its emotional peak when Harrison wittily and eloquently defends himself before the House Un-American Activities Committee (on the panel is a young Dick Nixon). Employed by the American imagination, is how one character describes Harrison, a term that could apply equally to Kingsolver as she masterfully resurrects a dark period in American history with the assured hand of a true literary artist.(Nov.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Although living in occupied WWII Paris, Sean is initially concerned only with the racing lifestyle and his friends within it. That all changes though when the Nazis kill his friends, and change his life forever. Seeking personal retribution on a Nazi officer and others involved, Sean's life soon becomes dominated by a need for payback, which is exacted with the help of the French Resistance, British intelligence, an arsenal of weaponry, and your own street smarts and brawn. Motivated by retribution and armed with tactics of sabotage you are a one man wrecking crew, blowing up zeppelins, derailing trains, imploding bridges, destroying armored tanks, and leveling enemy facilities in the name of vengeance.Open-world GameplayThe Saboteurin the first open-world, action game set in Nazi-occupied Europe, and combines a variety of different kinds of gameplay, including third-person shooter, stealth and racing. As in other open-world games, this means that although players will be tasked with completing an extensive list of set missions against Nazi units and individuals, they will also have the freedom to explore and fight throughout the game world as they choose. This world although set in Paris also encompasses the French countryside, as well as parts of Germany. Within it players will be able to use representations of actual landmarks &#151; for example, the Eiffel Tower &#151; for navigation, and a variety of vehicles for transportation and combat. In mission play, with each success players move closer to tracking down the particular Nazis responsible for the death of Sean's friends by putting the rewards that they receive for success to work on the black-market. They can trade for all sorts of items to help their progress, from weapons, to cars, maps and more. These all can also either be found throughout the game, or taken from defeated opponents, although the more commotion that is created and the higher the skills of the player, the greater the enemy response will be.The \"Will to Fight\" SystemAlthough built around Sean's desire for personal revenge,The Saboteuralso contains a play mechanism through which the lives of the non-player characters (NPCs) are improved, and can even be manipulated. This is the \"Will to Fight\" system. Long known as the \"City of Light,\" Paris as depicted in the game under Nazi occupation is a place dominated by stark black and white colors. These colors reflect the hopelessness of the people. But as the player collects victories against the invaders, a change will begin to be seen in the physical environments of the game, again reflecting the mood of the people. Where once there were only stark black and white colors and few civilians on the street, now players will see increasingly bright colors, reflecting the hope of the civilians and eventually incite an underground resistance among the Parisians to take up arms on their own, and even come to your aid when the odds are stacked against you.Key FeaturesExplore Open-World Paris- Climb the Eiffel Tour, snipe from Notre Dame Cathedral, and brawl on the Champs d&rsquo;Elysee as you sabotage your enemies.

        "0060094893": "Such superlatives as \"riveting\" and \"powerful\" can only hint at the craftsmanship on display in this transcendent story of love, loyalty and courage. While probing such issues as friendship, free speech and moral values, Crutcher ( Chinese Handcuffs ; Stotan! ) tells a tale whose mordant humor, poignancy and suspense pack a breathtaking wallop. A social outcast in junior high due to his excessive weight, narrator Eric Calhoune found a kindred spirit in Sarah Byrnes, whose face and hands were hideously disfigured in a childhood accident. Now a senior and considerably slimmed down through competitive swimming (though still aptly called \"Moby\"), Eric remains fiercely devoted to his friend, whose caustic tongue is her only protection from life's inequities. When Sarah abruptly stops talking and is committed to a mental ward, Eric is compelled to take action to help her, but quickly finds that he is in over his head. He risks their friendship by breaking his vow of secrecy and enlisting others' aid--help that comes from such unlikely quarters as a former bully, Eric's swim coach and, most surprisingly, his mother's seemingly wimpy boyfriend. A subplot centering on a self-righteous teammate drives home the point that nothing is as it appears on the surface, and leads to Eric being caught between his menacing vice-principal and the even more malevolent Mr. Byrnes--with spine-tingling results. Superb plotting, extraordinary characters and crackling narrative make this novel one to be devoured in a single unforgettable sitting.

Clarissa Bourne agrees to attend a book reading by her academic colleague Rafe Solmes but wakes up the next morning entirely unsure of what happened. Did he rape her? Did he drug her wine? She is soon on the receiving end of a barrage of text messages and unwanted gifts and is relieved when she is summoned to jury duty, hoping it will give her some respite from his unwanted attentions. The trial only serves to heighten her anxiety when the defendant, a rape victim, is degraded and humiliated by the prosecution. The defendant&#x2019;s treatment inspires Clarissa to meticulously record Rafe&#x2019;s overtures, which become increasingly threatening, especially after Clarissa grows closer to a fellow juror. Kendal expertly heightens the suspense while offering a disturbing portrait of a clever stalker who believes himself to be in love even as he engages in malevolent acts that undermine Clarissa&#x2019;s sense of identity and control. --Joanne Wilkinson",

As one of five distinct character types, players explore the world ofDiablo II, journey across distant lands, fight new villains, discover new treasures, and uncover ancient mysteries. Since the beginning of time, the forces of order and chaos have been engaged in an eternal struggle to decide the fate of all creation. That struggle has now come to the mortal realm, and neither man, demon, nor angel will be left unscathed. Diablo, lord of terror and youngest of the three prime evils, awakes from his long sleep beneath the dark earth. Setting in motion a grand scheme to free his exiled brothers, Mephisto and Baal, Diablo takes control of the small western kingdom of Khanduras. Working from deep within the ancient catacombs beneath the town of Tristram, Diablo grips the entire populace in a blanket of fear and paranoia. Ultimately, as even Khanduras's good King Leoric falls under Diablo's wicked power, a lone hero arises to challenge the darkness that engulfs the land. After plumbing the hellish depths of the labyrinth under Tristram, the nameless hero finally confronts the lord of terror himself. Knowing full well that Diablo's spirit can never be truly destroyed, the hero makes the noblest sacrifice of all--casting his soul and his very sanity aside, he takes the spirit of Diablo into himself, hoping that his own strength of will can contain the demon within. The hero doesn't realize that his selfless act will not only ensure Diablo's victory, but will also irrevocably damn his soul for all time.",

        "006087290X": "In her assured but overstuffed horror debut, Langan lovingly crafts the struggling town of Bedford, Maine, its unlucky inhabitants and the troubling history of the town's shuttered paper mill, before tearing it all to bloody pieces. Bedford is haunted by the beautiful Susan Marley, a damaged young woman who wanders the streets and never speaks a word, stirring \"feeling[s] of something undone, something quite wrong, at the sight of her.\" Those feelings are strongest in Susan's maladjusted little sister, Liz, wracked with guilt over Susan's fate; their mother, who refuses to acknowledge her wayward daughter's existence; and alcoholic high school teacher Paul Martin, who once had an affair with Susan. Susan's fall to her death in the final, rain-soaked days of winter triggers a series of events that bring the buried secrets of the town to terrifying reality&mdash;people and animals rise from the dead, and a spirit of homicidal rage grips the living. Fighting to survive, Langan's characters come brilliantly to life, their inner conflicts rendered in sharp but exhausting detail at once expansive and constricting, slowing the narrative to a crawl just before it whips into frenzied, graphic violence. This is horror on a big scale, akin to the more ambitious work of Stephen King, and though Langan's enormous imagination can slow her narrative, this effective debut promises great things to come.(Oct.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Like his last novel, The New Confessions , this highly readable tale is primarily a first-person narrative. Here Boyd's storyteller is Hope Clearwater, who has fled marital difficulties back in England to study chimpanzees in Africa. Through her eyes the reader is introduced to a bevy of English and American eccentrics, some benign, others malevolent in their effects on one another and on the chimpanzees. As a nonexpert, Hope observes the chimpanzees from an unusual perspective (which mirrors her refreshing and deeply felt attempts to understand her idiosyncratic estranged husband, a mathematician), and her discovery of warring factions among the supposedly peace-loving chimps roils academic and emotional waters for everyone. The novel, contradictorily, is both rambling and tightly woven, with Boyd inserting insightful, third-person commentary on the characters' inner lives. As befits a protagonist telling her own story, Hope often doesn't know where she's going until she gets there, but Boyd's skill in developing her character overrides some slight confusion about the more picaresque aspects of her adventure. Boyd should widen his audience with this adroitly written, accessible tale.Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

The annual Nobel Prize winner in that field never receives as much publicity as his or her compatriots in peace, literature, or physics. But if such slights are based on the notion that economics is dull, or that economists are concerned only with finance itself, Steven D. Levitt will change some minds. InFreakonomics(written with Stephen J. Dubner), Levitt argues that many apparent mysteries of everyday life don't need to be so mysterious: they could be illuminated and made even more fascinating by asking the right questions and drawing connections. For example, Levitt traces the drop in violent crime rates to a drop in violent criminals and, digging further, to the Roe v. Wade decision that preempted the existence of some people who would be born to poverty and hardship. Elsewhere, by analyzing data gathered from inner-city Chicago drug-dealing gangs, Levitt outlines a corporate structure much like McDonald's, where the top bosses make great money while scores of underlings make something below minimum wage. And in a section that may alarm or relieve worried parents, Levitt argues that parenting methods don't really matter much and that a backyard swimming pool is much more dangerous than a gun. These enlightening chapters are separated by effusive passages from Dubner's 2003 profile of Levitt inThe New York Times Magazine, which led to the book being written. In a book filled with bold logic, such back-patting veersFreakonomics, however briefly, away from what Levitt actually has to say.

        "0060763280": "Eker's claim to fame is that he took a $2,000 credit card loan, opened \"one of the first fitness stores in North America,\" turned it into a chain of 10 within two and a half years and sold it in 1987 for a cool (but somewhat modest-seeming) $1.6 million. Now the Vancouver-based entrepreneur traverses the continent with his \"Millionaire Mind Intensive Seminar,\" on which this debut motivational business manual is based. What sets it apart is Eker's focus on the way people think and feel about money and his canny, class-based analyses of broad differences among groups. In rat-a-tat, \"Let me explain\" seminar-speak, Eker asks readers to think back to their childhoods and pick apart the lessons they passively absorbed from parents and others about money. With such psychological nuggets as \"Rich people focus on opportunities/ Poor people focus on obstacles,\" Eker puts a positive spin on stereotypes, arguing that poverty begins, or rather, is allowed to continue, in one's imagination first, with actual material life becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. To that end, Eker counsels for admiration and against resentment, for positivity, self-promotion and thinking big and against wallowing, self-abnegation and small-mindedness. While much of the advice is self-evident, Eker's contribution is permission to think of one's financial foibles as a kind of mental illness&mdash;one, he says, that has a ready set of cures.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

John Irving's novel, which inspired the 1998 Jim Carrey movieSimon Birch, is his most popular book in Britain, and perhaps the oddest Christian mystic novel sinceFlannery O'Connor's work. Irving fans will find much that is familiar: the New England prep-school-town setting, symbolic amputations of man and beast, theGarp-like unknown father of the narrator (Owen's orphaned best friend), the rough comedy. The scene of doltish the doltish headmaster driving a trashed VW down the school's marble staircase is a marvelous set piece. So are the Christmas pageants Owen stars in. But it's all, asHighlightsmagazine used to put it, \"fun with a purpose.\"  When Owen plays baby Jesus in the pageants, and glimpses a tombstone with his death date while enactingA Christmas Carol, the slapstick doesn't cancel the fact that hewasborn to be martyred. The book's countless subplots add up to a moral argument, specifically an indictment of American foreign policy--from Vietnam to the Contras.The book's mystic religiosity is steeped in Robertson Davies'sDeptford trilogy, and the fatal baseball relates to the fatefully misdirected snowball in the first Deptford novel,Fifth Business. Tiny, symbolic Owen echoes the hero of Irving's teacher G&uuml;nter Grass'sThe Tin Drum--the two characters share the same initials.

And with the addition of activities like Skateboarding and Rhythm Kung Fu, players will be using the Wii Balance Board accessory in a variety of new and fun ways.GameplayAs with the originalWii Fitrelease,Wii Fit Plusis designed, as its name implies, to improve the user's fitness. The game contains a large number of activities that fall into a variety of categories, including: yoga, aerobics, strength training and balance games. With all but a few exceptions, which utilize variations on a standard Wii Remote configuration, all activities utilize the Wii Balance Board (not included, but available with theWii Fit PlusBalance Board Bundle), either alone or configured with either a Wii Remote alone or the Wii Remote and nunchuck. The Balance Board, like any other Wii controller acts as a motion/pressure sensing device wirelessly synched to your Wii and replicating your body's movements. Each controller employed occupies one of the Wii's four wireless inputs, together mapping the reference points needed to recreate most full body motions on screen. Although this limits the majority of the activities to a single player orientation, various activities throughout the game support up to eight players in alternating play.To useWii Fit Plusplayers import their Miis from their Wii system, set up profiles, establish a current physical baseline, set fitness goals, and embark on a routine to reach them.Wii Fit Plustracks your usage, weight and progress towards your goal over time, giving you a status report as you start each session. At any time players can choose whatever activity they want, whether exercise or balance game, and as they progress in these they will level up in each, gaining points, setting high scores and unlocking more activities.Personalization Option Via 'The Locker Room'The originalWii Fitwas designed to have something for everyone. NowWii Fit Plusraises the bar by providing users with personalization options that allow them to find/create a specific workout routine that is exactly right for them, their family and their lifestyle. One example of this is \"The Locker Room.\" Easily accessible throughout the game, here players can choose from a number customizable options that allow them to maximize their time withWii Fit Pluswithout having to navigate through the game menu while in the middle of a workout. In essence this allows players to become their own personal trainer. Customization options available within The Locker Room include: preprogrammed and timedWii Fit PlusRoutines; My Routine, where you choose your own set of activities, optimizing their length and area of the body to be focused on; and Favorites, a notation of activities you frequent, which provides fast access to exercises you enjoy doing the most.Addition Yoga and Strength ExercisesDesigned as an addition to the already substantial list of focused, physical exercises available inWii Fit,Wii Fit Pluscontains six new and challenging strength and yoga activities. But continuing with the game's commitment to personalization, the key to these additions is not in their volume, but in how the player chooses to mix and match them. Do them in the order they are presented, or combine them in whatever order you want. The choice is yours. The player even has the ability to repeat the ones that he/she prefers, maximizing attention and effort where it is needed most. In addition, for those to whom time is a commodity, you can now omit unnecessary interludes between exercises, making for a continuous, timesaving routine.A Wealth of New Balance GamesRegardless of the considerable fitness factor packed intoWii Fit Plus, the Nintendo brand is and will always be all about having fun. With that in mindWii Fit Plusalso comes packed with 15 new, entertaining balance games suitable for every member of the family. Just a few of those that players can expect to see are: Juggling; Skateboarding; Snowball Fight; Obstacle Course, a log-leaping, cannonball-evading event reminiscent of what Nintendo icon Mario must go through; and Perfect 10, a balance game designed to promote a combination of physical and mental health. In this final example the player's Mii is situated between multiple color-coated balls, each showing specific numbers, with the goal to swing your hips, hula style, in different directions to tap out a total of ten as many times as possible before time runs out.Key Game FeaturesUsers can input the amount of time they want to spend on their workouts or select an area for personal improvement, andWii Fit Pluswill suggest a number of diverse activities for them.For the first time, users can mix and match which strength and yoga activities they prefer on a given day. The seamless exercise flows make it easier than ever for users to maintain their daily workout routines.Users might be asked to run an obstacle course across a series of platforms, zoom across a beach on a Segway x2 Personal Transporter or flap their arms to help their hilarious chicken-suited characters aim for targets.The range of games and customization options will make players want to play every day.

Thus, their parleys tend to center on expressions of and responses to feelings, or what the author labels \"rapport-talk\" (private conversation). Men, on the other hand, use conversation to achieve or maintain social status; they set out to impart knowledge (termed \"report-talk,\" or public speaking). Calling on her research into the workings of dialogue, Tannen examines the functioning of argument and interruption, and convincingly supports her case for the existence of \"genderlect,\" contending that the better we understand it, the better our chances of bridging the communications gap integral to the battle of the sexes.Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

Despite the fact that the academy is known as &#x201C;the great leveler,&#x201D; there are students who have reason to hate Han, specifically the Bayar twins, Micah and Fiona, because he stole the Demon King's amulet from their father, the High Wizard. To gain the upper hand on them, Han joins forces with a mysterious wizard he met in the dream world, but what this wizard asks in return may be more than the teen wishes to give. Meanwhile, Princess Raisa has fled from an arranged marriage with Micah Bayar. She and her loyal&#x2013;and beloved&#x2013;soldier, Amon, are also making their way to Oden's Ford so that Raisa might receive a military education in order to become a stronger ruler. Raisa's and Han's paths have crossed in the past, but when they meet again their connection is more powerful than before.

        "0062079603": "*Starred Review* The ratification of the U.S. Constitution in 1788 provided a common legal and political framework to bind 13 supposedly sovereign states to a stronger federal government. But the U.S. was still more of a theoretical nation than an actual one. The War of 1812 and the Mexican War engendered surges of nationalism, but it required a Civil War to administer the death blow to the most extreme forms of sectionalism. Winchester, the widely acclaimed author, is a native of Great Britain who recently became an American citizen. His focus here is on the more subtle aspects of nation building. He examines the accomplishments of a variety of characters, some famous and some obscure, whose visions and mastery of emerging technologies drew Americans closer together as our geographic size expanded. Thomas Jefferson&#x2019;s vision of an &#x201C;empire of liberty&#x201D; led to the acquisition of the Louisiana Territory and the Lewis and Clark expedition. William Maclure, a hyperactive Scottish immigrant, provided a geological survey of vast areas of the eastern U.S. and then promoted the value of a practical education for ordinary citizens. Winchester provides a fascinating portrayal of Samuel Morse, the &#x201C;man who tamed the lightning,&#x201D; and the vital role of the telegraph in bridging distances. This is a finely crafted and valuable reminder that the evolution of our united nation was a process often accelerated by unlikely, sometimes eccentric men who operated outside the political sphere.

        "0099524252": "The long life and powerful personality of England's beloved Virgin Queen have eternal appeal, and popular historian Alison Weir depicts both with panache. She's especially good at evoking the physical texture of Tudor England: the elaborate royal gowns (actually an intricate assembly of separate fabric panels buttoned together over linen shifts), the luxurious but unhygienic palaces (Elizabeth got the only \"close stool\"; most members of her retinue relieved themselves in the courtyards), the huge meals heavily seasoned to disguise the taste of spoiled meat. Against this earthy backdrop, Elizabeth's intelligence and formidable political skills stand in vivid relief. She may have been autocratic, devious, even deceptive, but these traits were required to perform a 45-year tightrope walk between the two great powers of Europe, France and Spain. Both countries were eager to bring small, weak England under their sway and to safely marry off its inconveniently independent queen. Weir emphasizes Elizabeth's precarious position as a ruling woman in a man's world, suggesting plausibly that the single life was personally appealing as well as politically expedient for someone who had seen many ambitious ladies--including her own mother--ruined and even executed for just the appearance of sexual indiscretions. The author's evaluations of such key figures in Elizabeth's reign as the Earl of Leicester (arguably the only man she ever loved) and William Cecil (her most trusted adviser) are equally cogent and respectful of psychological complexity. Weir does a fine job of retelling this always-popular story for a new generation.--Wendy Smith--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

When the destructive behavior (including self-mutilation) accelerates, Claire and Paul send Mia to the unlikely Morava Academy, in the Czech Republic, a kind of Spartan military institution where 50 teens are rigorously monitored and reprogrammed. Meanwhile, back in L.A., the parents undergo an intensive group therapy called Discovery to learn to shed guilt for their daughter's behavior, and also forgive her. Oddly, Morava is soon shut down after allegations of staff abuse, but Mia goes through a brilliant turnaround at Spring Creek Lodge in Montana. Mia's desperate diary entries appear between Claire's lively, angry, sarcastic narrative, allowing mother and daughter to maintain a heart-wrenching, honest dialogue.(Mar.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Alas, the Royal Privilege is more  like a Predicament. Not only does she have to endure daily princess lessons from  her critical Grandm&egrave;re (\"It isn't as if I'm going to show up at the  castle and start hurling olives at the ladies-in-waiting\"), but her new  stepfather is also her algebra teacher, her mother is pregnant and vomiting, she  doesn't like her boyfriend very much, and she's convinced the real love of her  life--her best friend's older brother--thinks of her as a kid.Written in diary form like Louise Rennison's award-winningAngus, Thongs, and Full-Frontal  Snogging, Meg Cabot's endearing and often hilarious novelPrincess in  Love--third in the series afterThe Princess DiariesandPrincess in the Spotlight--is  sure to appeal to teen readers who will be able to relate to Mia--a young woman  who would like people to know that \"behind this mutant facade beats the heart of  a person who is striving, just like everybody else in this world, to find  self-actualization.\" (Ages 12 and older)--Karin Snelson",

Taylor Markham, a 17-year-old who was abandoned years ago by her mother, takes on leadership of the boarding school's six Houses. Plagued with doubts about being boss, she's not sure she can handle her Cadet counterpart, Jonah Griggs, whom she met several years before while running away to find her mother. When Hannah, a sort of house mother who has taken Taylor under her wing, disappears, Taylor puzzles over the book manuscript the woman left behind. Hannah's tale involves a tragic car accident on the Jellicoe Road more than 20 years earlier. Only three children survived, and Taylor discovers that this trio, plus a Cadet and a Townie, developed an epic friendship that was the foundation of the many mysteries in her life and identity, as well as of the war games. While the novel might put off casual readers, patient, thoughtful teens will remain to extract clues from the interwoven scraps of Hannah's narrative, just as Taylor does, all the while seeing the collapse of the barriers erected among the three groups over the years. Elegiac passages and a complex structure create a somewhat dense, melancholic narrative with elements of romance, mystery, and realistic fiction.&mdash;Suzanne Gordon, Peachtree Ridge High School, Suwanee, GACopyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I was in the military from age seventeen as an ROTC cadet until I was a retired GI at age fifty-six. Others came from my service as Secretary of State and as National Security Advisor. Yet others came to me as I wandered through life. In this book I want to share with you a selection of these stories as well as experiences that have stayed with me over the years. Each one of them taught me something important about life and leadership. Some of the stories deal with serious aspects of my life, including some of the controversial issues I was involved in during my tenure as Secretary of State. There are also humorous stories from my life as well.  I offer them to you for whatever use you may wish to make of them.The first part ofIt Worked for Meexplains my Thirteen Rules, which have been bouncing around since they were first published inMagazineover twenty years ago. These are rules that I have gathered over the years and to which I&#x2019;ve adhered in my career.CLP's Thirteen Rules:It ain't as bad as you think.

You may get it.Don't let adverse facts stand in the way of a good decision.You can't make someone else's choices. You shouldn't let someone else make yours.Check small things.Share credit.Remain calm. Be kind.Have a vision. Be demanding.Don't take counsel of your fears or naysayers.Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier.The rest of the book focuses on everything from the importance of really knowing who you are and how to always be yourself to why I put an emphasis on knowing and taking care of others, especially those who are your followers.

        "009950569X": "Starred Review.Unabashedly inspired by Malcolm Gladwell's bestsellingThe Tipping Point,the brothers Heath&mdash;Chip a professor at Stanford's business school, Dan a teacher and textbook publisher&mdash;offer an entertaining, practical guide to effective communication. Drawing extensively on psychosocial studies on memory, emotion and motivation, their study is couched in terms of \"stickiness\"&mdash;that is, the art of making ideas unforgettable. They start by relating the gruesome urban legend about a man who succumbs to a barroom flirtation only to wake up in a tub of ice, victim of an organ-harvesting ring. What makes such stories memorable and ensures their spread around the globe? The authors credit six key principles: simplicity, unexpectedness, concreteness, credibility, emotions and stories. (The initial letters spell out \"success\"&mdash;well, almost.) They illustrate these principles with a host of stories, some familiar (Kennedy's stirring call to \"land a man on the moon and return him safely to the earth\" within a decade) and others very funny (Nora Ephron's anecdote of how her high school journalism teacher used a simple, embarrassing trick to teach her how not to \"bury the lead\"). Throughout the book, sidebars show how bland messages can be made intriguing. Fun to read and solidly researched, this book deserves a wide readership.(Jan. 16)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "B0007CGBDG": "If you're not familiar with Snowblind Studios' delightful game engine (first seen in Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance), you are missing out. It has received much critical acclaim, and for good reason&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;this core technology has made some of the best action/RPGs of the last several years. While other developers have licensed this engine for use in their own games, Snowblind has taken them all to school on how to squeeze the most juice out of it. Return to Arms is a visually stunning game in every way, and a lot of my issues with the first Champions of Norrath have been addressed. It's a pity that there isn't really anything in RtA that moves the genre forward or breaks from convention in any way.All of the standard action/RPG elements are present and accounted for, and for the most part are done with a level of polish and flair rarely seen. Leveling up each character can be done in a nigh-infinite number of ways, since each one has a multitude of skills to develop or ignore at your choice. Bosses drop fatty loot to collect and power up your avatar with, and completing challenges (which become unlocked after finishing a stage) unlocks new online maps as well as hooking you up with bonus stat and skill points. These challenge rounds are easily the most interesting new element of RtA, with nonstandard objectives or restrictions that make you use your gaming skills or solve puzzles to emerge triumphant.Every single change from the original Champions of Norrath is a positive one, as far as I can tell. The removal of random maps sounds like a bummer, but the result is that each level is designed much more tightly and flows better than before. Skills have been rebalanced and seem to be a bit more even, and the two new classes offer unique and fun styles of play. And, as has been mentioned, the latest revision of the Snowblind engine is amazing. Textures give a startling illusion of depth to surfaces, lighting changes give each area a different feel, and the excellent particle effects really bring the flashy spell animations to life. Plus, even though I've been seeing it for the last few years, I still have to stop and marvel at the water this engine can render out.The icing on this cake of fantasy hack n' slash goodness is the amount of content available. Between the four difficulty modes (which are designed like Diablo II's, where you can start the next mode with your powered-up hero after clearing the one before), co-op and competitive online multiplayer, and the seven playable classes, there is an awful lot of game here to adventure through. Whether or not you'll be sick of cleaving orc heads before you finish it is another matter entirely, but rest assured that this is no weaksauce 10-hour quest with little replay value.All of this high-heaped praise begs the question of why isn't RtA the must-have fantasy epic of 2005. The answer to that is simple: Though everything is very well-done, it's difficult to shake the feeling that I've been playing this same game since Diablo came out on PC in 1997. The core concept of bashing skulls and gaining levels and loot is still strong as can be, and I had a lot of fun with RtA, but the foreshadowings of a Dynasty Warriors-like rut are clearly visible. It's rare to see a sequel that does this little to shake up the gameplay formula of the original, but with that being said, anyone who enjoyed the first Champions title or either of the Dark Alliance games will find a lot to love here.Concept:Tighten up, refine, and expand everything that you know about console dungeon crawlersGraphics:Nobody can rock the Snowblind engine like Snowblind &#8211; gorgeous visuals aboundSound:Easily the low point. The only thing worth noting is the delightful thumping noise maces make as they bash headsPlayability:The new evade move makes all the difference in nasty boss fightsEntertainment:What's not to like about crushing waves of enemies and leveling up to godlike status?Replay:Moderately HighRated:8 out of 10Editor:Adam BiessenerIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:I can't help it. I just love experience grinders. Throw in co-op play, some solid graphics, online play for extra value, and, quite frankly, I'm sold. I loved every moment I put into this game. That's not to say it doesn't have its share of problems. First of all, the story is pretty much non-existent. Be good or be evil, fight through some planes of power&#8230;blah, blah, blah&#8230;get me to my next cool weapon or skill. That's about all I care about. And to this end, Return to Arms delivers. The boss battles are epic, the game is longer than most, and it's certainly worth multiple play-throughs just to try out the other classes. It's not gnome rocket science, but it sure is fun.Rated:8 out of 10Editor:Andy McNamaraSubscribe to Game Informer--Amazon.com",
        "0060509406": "Sometimes a book can be utterly full of holes and you still can't put it down. InMrs. Kimble, first-time novelist Jennifer Haigh follows the marital career of Ken Kimble, opportunist, serial husband, and all around schmuck. The first section, set in Virginia in the 1960s, revolves around alcoholic first wife Birdie. As we enter the story, Kimble has already left her alone with two small children she is ill equipped to raise on her own. Kimble's absence in this section sets the tone for the book, which is not so much about Kimble himself as it is about the women he dupes over the years. Next up is Joan, aNewsweekreporter recovering from a mastectomy at her late father's home in Florida. A wealthy, confident woman left unsteady by breast cancer, she falls for Kimble, who now turns up in a hippie-ish incarnation. In the final section, Kimble weds Dinah, who had been his children's babysitter back in Virginia. Their marriage unravels as, at the end of the book, Kimble's secrets are revealed one by one. Unfortunately, the central secret of the book is never laid bare: how did the man get to be such a jerk? Other problems are never dealt with, either: we never believe a whip-smart woman like Joan could be so transparently snow-jobbed. We never understand why Dinah stays with an aging crook. Nevertheless,Mrs.  Kimbleis still engrossing. Haigh is so gifted at creating vivid scenes and strong characters, we find ourselves surrendering our disbelief despite our better judgment.

        "0060514957": "Scottoline's previous thrillers (Dead Ringer;Courting Trouble; etc.) have featured the women of the all-female Philadelphia law firm Rosato and Associates, and have concerned the usual elements of murder, stalking, bribery and corruption. This novel by the former trial lawyer and Edgar Award winner, while embracing the requisite ingredients, is especially engaging because of its personal angle: growing out of Scottoline's discovery of her own grandparents' alien registration cards, the book involves the case of an Italian-American who was interned during WWII. Amadeo Brandolini emigrated from Italy to Philadelphia, where he started a family and worked as a fisherman. When the war broke out, the FBI arrested and imprisoned him (along with 10,000 other Italian-Americans). He lost everything and wound up committing suicide in the camp. Rosato and Associates' young star, Mary DiNunzio, steps up to represent Brandolini's estate as it sues for reparations. Mary \"grew up in South Philly, where she'd learned to pop her gum, wear high heels, and work overtime\" and silently prays to saints when she can't find things. This case, a pro bono one, means a lot to her; the local small business owners and family friends she grew up with want retribution for Brandolini as much as she does. Mary puts all of her energy into the job, and when clues suggest Brandolini's death may have been a homicide, she becomes even more enthralled. As Mary learns more, the enemy camp (another Italian-American family, the Saracones) turns its murderous eye on her. Scottoline skillfully weaves a complicated, gripping and fast-paced tale, at turns comical, nerve-wracking and enlightening.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have. In addition to adding multi-player action via xBox live, or via networked consoles, the Xbox version of Doom 3 also adds a great two-player cooperative mode.Hell on MarsYour character is a low ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the United Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars Research Facility. That's pretty much all the back-story you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the story-line department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of theDoomfranchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?) it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well crafted sound effects were successful at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly-lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth, ethereal Revenant fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy, a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking.

In this honest, disturbing memoir, O'Neal, now 41, reveals the behind-the-scenes story of her lonely, chaotic life&mdash;one dominated by struggles with drugs and damaging relationships. O'Neal portrays her divorced parents (actors Joanna Moore and Ryan O'Neal) as neglectful and abusive, with drug problems of their own. Though O'Neal appeared in such kid-fodder movies asThe Bad News BearsandLittle Darlings, she says that during the '70s and early '80s she battled depression and attempted suicide. \"I found that coke made me feel so much better,\" she recounts in the straightforward though unoriginal language that characterizes the narrative. Much of the book's second half covers her fraught marriage to volatile tennis champ John McEnroe; these passages alternate between recollections of the pleasure of being in love and having children and the pain of living with McEnroe, whom she depicts as controlling and demeaning. Ten years and three children later, O'Neal and McEnroe divorced. She resumed using drugs, fought child custody battles and watched her mother die of cancer. Although O'Neal speeds through the details, she addresses her addictions: \"I wanted to take my own life but... instead... I started doing drugs 24/7. I couldn't stop.\" She also zips through her recovery, abruptly claiming \"rebirth\" in the final chapter. Writing this memoir seems to have been cathartic for O'Neal.

In this fable-like novel, Coelho makes good on his promise, with the creation of a fictional character named Veronika who decides to kill herself when faced with all that is wrong with the world and how powerless she feels to change anything. Although she survives her initial suicide attempt, she is committed to a mental hospital where she begins to wrestle with the meaning of mental illness and whether forced drugging should be inflicted on patients who don't fit into the narrow definition of \"normal.\" The strength and tragedy of Veronika's fictional story was instrumental in passing new government regulations in Brazil that have made it more difficult to have a person involuntarily committed. Like any great storyteller, Coelho has used the realm of fiction to magically infiltrate and alter the realm of reality.--Gail Hudson--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

Well, if you're going to go around giving an exuberantly bossy rodent a cookie, you'd best be prepared to do one or two more favors for it before your day is through. For example, he'll certainly need a glass of milk to wash down that cookie, won't he? And you can't expect him to drink the milk without a straw, can you? By the time our hero is finished granting all the mouse's very urgent requests--and cleaning up after him--it's no wonder his head is becoming a bit heavy. Laura Joffe Numeroff's tale of warped logic is a sure-fire winner in the giggle-generator category. But concerned parents can rest assured, there's even a little education thrown in for good measure: underneath the folly rest valuable lessons about cause and effect.

        "006174266X": "Gr 5-8-Donovan Curtis is an impulse-driven prankster who, at the start of Ungifted, manages to alienate both the students and faculty of his middle school. First he mocks the basketball team over the school PA system with a derisive cheer and then he whacks the school's statue of Atlas with a stick, knocking the huge globe off and sending it rolling down the hill where it smashes into the gymnasium and stops the big game. When Donovan ends up on the carpet, the district superintendent accidentally adds his name to the roll of gifted students at the Academy for Scholastic Distinction. Although he flounders at his new school, Donovan ends up humanizing a program that focuses on academic achievement and ignores the social aspects of students' success. From his first day when he startles the robotics team by naming their robot, to his saving the class from summer school by drafting his pregnant sister as the answer to a missed credit in Human Development, Donovan finds that his gift lies in helping the smart kids by teaching them how to be \"normal.\" Using an ancestor who survived the Titanic as inspiration, Donovan has a goofy kindness that charms characters and readers alike. Reminiscent of Stanley Yelnats and Joey Pigza, he careens through life much like the out-of-control globe from Atlas's statue. The story is told from the points of view of various characters (each chapter titled with an Un-word), and readers hear from teachers and administrators, students-both gifted and not-and family members. The message is tolerance, and Korman expertly and humorously delivers it in an unpretentious and universally appealing tale.-Jane Barrer, Steinway Intermediate School, New York City&#x3B1;(c) Copyright 2011.

Such a synopsis, however, does not do justice to Taylor's literary style in this rich evocation of her lifelong love affair with God. \"When I think of my first cathedral,\" she writes, \"I am back in a field behind my parents' house in Kansas, with every stalk of prairie grass lit up from within.\" Drawn to the church, she compulsively overworks: \"I had such a strong instinct for rescue that my breasts fairly leaked when I came across those in need of rescuing.\" Though she has found new employment, she realizes she is still a priest: \"I miss being a lightning rod, conducting all that heat and light not only from heaven to earth but also from person to person.\" Current and former clergy will relate to her comical and sometimes touching descriptions of parish life, while memoir buffs will savor her journey as she identifies her core beliefs, sets boundaries and learns to relish her \"blessed swath\" of the world.(May)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0061438596": "While the Bible may be the word of God, transcribed by divinely inspired men, it does not provide a full (or even partial) account of the life of Jesus Christ. Lucky for us that Christopher Moore presents a funny, lighthearted satire of the life of Christ--from his childhood days up to his crucifixion--inLamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal. This clever novel is surely blasphemy to some, but to others it's a coming-of-age story of the highest order.Joshua (a.k.a. Jesus) knows he is unique and quite alone in his calling, but what exactly does his Father want of him? Taking liberties with ancient history, Moore works up an adventure tale as Biff and Joshua seek out the three wise men so that Joshua can better understand what he is supposed to do as Messiah. Biff, a capable sinner, tags along and gives Joshua ample opportunities to know the failings and weaknesses of being truly human. With a wit similar to Douglas Adams, Moore pulls no punches: a young Biff has the hots for Joshua's mom, Mary, which doesn't amuse Josh much: \"Don't let anyone ever tell you that the Prince of Peace never struck anyone.\" And the origin of the Easter Bunny is explained as a drunken Jesus gushes his affection for bunnies, declaring, \"Henceforth and from now on, I decree that whenever something bad happens to me, there shall be bunnies around.\"One small problem with the narrative is that Biff and Joshua often do not have distinct voices. A larger difficulty is that as the tone becomes more somber with Joshua's life drawing to its inevitable close, the one-liners, though not as numerous, seem forced. True to form,Lambkeeps the story of Joshua light, even after its darkest moments.--Michael Ferch--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",
        "006230755X": "Blum specializes in nonfiction narrative showcasing explosive periods in U.S. history, as in the Edgar Award&#x2013;winning American Lightning (2011). His latest focuses on the period before WWI, when German saboteurs in the U.S. attempted to use bombs and even biological weapons, hoping to weaken the country enough to keep it from entering the war on the side of the Allies. The hero of the piece is New York Police Inspector Tom Tunney, who thwarted many of the plots and captured numerous enemy agents in New York. One problem common to books of this kind is that the author tries to make everything relate to the plot, sometimes pulling the rug out from under the reader in the process. For example, the opening describes a bomb plot aimed at St. Patrick&#x2019;s Cathedral in New York City, prompting the reader to think, &#x201C;Wow! I didn&#x2019;t know the Germans did that.&#x201D; We learn later that Blum is only setting the scene of an unstable era, and that the plot was actually the work of anarchists, not Germans.

This slim volume finds protagonist Joanna and husband Walter and kids leaving the wicked city for the bucolic town of Stepford. Despite its ideal facade, the sleepy little storybook town actually is more wicked. Joanna soon notices that her female neighbors are all body and no brains and seemingly exist only to do housework while their husbands gather nightly at a mysterious men's club. Even worse, it appears that the women who moved there just before her suddenly begin morphing into hausfraus built like swimsuit models-and she's next! It's hard to tell if this is a stab at the feminist movement or simply a male fantasy, but it's a fun read and will keep you turning the pages.

        "0060191988": "Jewel Kilcher was the first to admit that this book of 100 or so of her poems would not have been published if her dazzling debut album,Pieces of You, hadn't sold 10 million copies. And granted, Jewel is not going to replace Deborah Garrison'sA Working Girl Can't Winon anybody's hit parade of serious poets who write for regular people.But--shockingly!--Jewel's book of poetry is solid by celeb-poet standards, and a fair bit of it is actually sort of readable in its own right. Maybe it's not a bad idea to raise your kids on an 80-acre Alaskan farm with plenty of chores and no TV, as Mr. Kilcher did. Unlike most young people, let alone overnight stars, Jewel has led a life of some intrinsic interest. While they're often prosaically straightforward, her poems about rescuing a newborn calf in the midnight snow, listening to wolves howl in a canyon storm, and racing naked out of a sauna of a winter evening bring us more useful experience than kid poets usually have to share. Some of Jewel's homesteading verse is no worse than some of Gary Snyder's late nature poems; though she'll never write nature poems remotely as good as his early workRiprap, neither will he, probably. Preachiness is the enemy of both poets' deep religious impulses.Jewel's poems about dumping a lover or thrilling to parking-lot sex &quot;between the moon and a Chevrolet&quot; are perceptive, at points even evocative. Her ode to her own breasts as a nest for her beloved is no good, but it's an honest failure. Her dress at the Oscars was more embarrassing.The music critics contend that Jewel's music is influenced by Joni Mitchell, though Jewel claims she didn't listen to her until lately. In comparingJoni Mitchell: The Complete Poems and Lyricswith Jewel's book, we find that both use the image of the cactus for a heart that resists a restricting embrace, but that Mitchell is cleverer with language. When Joni's lover is away, &quot;Me and them lonesome blues collide / The bed's too big, / The frying pan's too wide.&quot; Meanwhile, Jewel baldly observes, &quot;I miss you miserably, dear / and I can't quite manage / to face this unbearably / large bed / alone.&quot;On the other hand, Jewel does conclude with a nice image for toughing it out with a sentimental gesture--she shaves her armpits with his razor and cheap hotel soap. Ow! We feel her pain. Also, Jewel's &quot;Underage&quot; holds its own against Mitchell's &quot;Raised on Robbery,&quot; while demonstrating the influence that probably outweighed Mitchell in Jewel's artistic development: her dad, with whom she played gigs as a child in Alaska.I hung out once in the bathroom of Trade Winds Harley bar in AnchorageWith several biker chicks for company until the cops had left.They had pale skin and thick black eye makeupAnd they asked me to sing at their weddings.I said I'd ask my dad.We all sat on the counter and waited for the pigs to leave.Some guy OD'd and was outside foaming at the mouth.I remember looking in the mirrorAnd seeing this white face,My shirt all buttoned up.The women were nice to meAnd looked like dark angelsBeside me. I liked them,And together we waitedPatiently for the cops to leaveSo I could go back outAnd join my dad upOn stage.The great peril for Jewel, as for most poets when very young, is artless sincerity. Her poem about her dad's Vietnam War trauma is dead sentiment, but she does far better in &quot;Grimshaw,&quot; about a Vietvet who came to watch the Kilchers play, perpetually requesting &quot;Ain't Goin' to Study War No More&quot; and drinking four quarts of beer a night until the day he shot his face off. Which made little Jewel vow to deal with her own emotions sooner rather than too late.Careless editing permitted Jewel to misspell the names of Tom Waits and Charles Bukowski and the word &quot;peek.&quot; Most young fans won't notice, and the very poems about love troubles that older readers will find gratingly obvious will strike them as headline news to be taken to heart.--Tim Appelo",
        "0062197258": "Amazon Best Books of the Month, June 2012: Many times as I was readingInto the Darkest Corner, the refrain from that old R&B; song kept replaying in my head: \"It's a thin line between love and hate...\" Apologies, as it'll now be stuck in yours for the next couple of days, but Elizabeth Haynes' highly suspenseful and cleverly crafted psychological thriller will haunt you for much longer. In it we find our obsessive-compulsive heroine, Catherine Bailey, checking and rechecking her door locks six times, eschewing red clothing, shopping only on certain days--clearly something horrible has happened, and Haynes masterfully teases out the disturbing details, which involve a Jekyll and Hyde boyfriend. As the story unfolds, it provides subtle insight into why, despite red flags and bruises, someone would stay in an abusive relationship, and it makes you root for Catherine all the more to overcome the psychological fallout. If you're a fan of cinematic showdowns, you won't be disappointed. But the quietly powerful moments in Haynes' narrative resonate even more, as she illustrates that one of the bravest things someone can do is lock the door behind her, maybe five or six times, and step out into an uncertain world again.--Erin Kodicek",
        "006087600X": "The diaries our 40th president kept while in office&mdash;edited and abridged by historian Brinkley (The Great Deluge)&mdash;are largely a straightforward political chronicle. Reagan describes meetings with heads of state and antiabortion leaders, reflects on legislative strategy and worries about leaks to the press. He often used his diary to vigorously defend his polices: for example, after a 1984 visit with South African archbishop Desmond Tutu (whom Reagan calls \"na&iuml;ve\"), the president explained why his approach to apartheid&mdash;\"quiet diplomacy\"&mdash;was preferable to sanctions. Reagan sometimes seems uncomfortable with dissent, as when he is irked by a high school student who presents a petition advocating a nuclear freeze. And he often sees the media as a \"lynch mob,\" trying to drum up scandal where there is none. Reagan's geniality shines through in his more quotidian comments: he muses regularly about how much he appreciates Nancy, and his complaints about hating Monday mornings make him seem quite like everyone else. Brinkley doesn't weigh down the text with extensive annotation; this makes for smooth reading, but those who don't remember the major political events of the 1980s will want to refer to the glossary of names. Reagan's diaries are revealing, and Brinkley has done historians and the broad public a great service by editing them for publication.(May 22)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0060799250": "Any memoir based on the scandal of the moment must begin with a bang, and Frey's account of her relationship with Scott Peterson certainly does. The first seven pages race breathlessly through that first evening in November 2002 when she met Peterson on a blind date: flirting with him over dinner, splurging on gin & tonics, singing some tipsy karaoke duets and returning to Peterson's hotel for what she acknowledged the next day \"felt like a one-night stand.\" Frey then proceeds to tell the story that is doubtless familiar to throngs of gossip hounds. She describes how Peterson seduced her with his charm, charisma and apparently paternal feelings towards her young daughter. Frey also details her growing suspicions about her mysterious new boyfriend, fears that were realized when a friend finally connected the dots for her and Frey learned that Peterson was in fact married, that his pregnant wife was missing and that he was the prime suspect in the case. From there, it was just a short step to becoming a police informant and, ultimately, the key witness against Peterson at his double murder trial. Frey includes all the sordid highlights: secret tape recordings, TV makeovers, nude photographs, personal betrayals, and, always, the merciless hounding of the press. Frey portrays herself as an honest, decent young woman (the book is liberally sprinkled with Bible quotations) caught up in the whirlwind of a real-life melodrama. As forgettable as it was inevitable, mercifully short on biographical background, Frey's memoir delivers all the behind-the-scenes details that readers will want as the players in the Peterson saga quit the public stage.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "000712774X": "ThatThe Illustrated Manhas remained in print since being  published in 1951 is fair testimony to the universal appeal of Ray Bradbury's work. Only his second collection (the first wasDark Carnival, later reworked intoThe October Country), it is a marvelous, if mostly dark, quilt of science fiction, fantasy, and horror. In an ingenious framework to open and close the book, Bradbury presents himself as a nameless narrator who meets the Illustrated Man--a wanderer whose entire body is a living canvas of exotic tattoos. What's even more remarkable, and increasingly disturbing, is that the illustrations are themselves magically alive, and each proceeds to unfold its own story, such as \"The Veldt,\" wherein rowdy children take a game of virtual reality way over the edge. Or \"Kaleidoscope,\" a heartbreaking portrait of stranded astronauts about to reenter our atmosphere--without the benefit of a spaceship. Or \"Zero Hour,\" in which invading aliens have discovered a most logical ally--our own children.

The first half of the book concerns his naval forbears: his grandfather commanded an aircraft carrier in the Second World War, while his father presided over all naval forces in the Pacific during the Vietnam War. They were the first father-son admirals in American history. Young John McCain knew he had enormous shoes to fill and rebelled against many of the expectations set for him. At the Naval Academy, he was nearly expelled, graduating fifth from the bottom of his class. He never became an admiral, but achieved fame another way: as a naval aviator in 1967, he was shot down over North Vietnam and spent several years in POW camps, where he was beaten, tortured, and nearly allowed to die. McCain describes the awful details of his imprisonment and tells how he stayed mentally strong during seemingly endless months of solitary confinement and how he communicated in code with fellow captives.Faith of My Fathersconcludes with McCain's release and contains no information about his subsequent political career.

The entirety of the quest fits this darker mood, as both Link and NPC's alike share the same concern for the changes about in Hyrule.More than just a spiritual successor to previous Zelda installments,Twilight Princessoffers players a new way of controlling Link through dungeons, forests, towns, and the bizarre Twilight Realm: precise weapon controls with the Wii remote! Players can use the remote to control Links' weapons including the sword, arrows, and boomerang. This new control scheme allows for much faster and more accurate control than on previous Nintendo hardware. For example, waving the remote in the air will result in Link performing the same move with the sword. To fire off on arrow, players \"pull back\" on a virtual controller string as the Wii remote's speaker lets players know that the projectile is ready for release. It all works incredibly well and adds to the title's immersion and style- you feel more in the center of the action than in previous Zelda games.As impressive as the new control scheme is, the scope and size of the new land of the Hyrule is equally as impressive- truly the Wii's first epic adventure. Beautifully crafted and four years in the making, the land players travel through is vast and diverse as the dungeons and monsters that lie within. As players collect triforce pieces from the distant sections of the continent, they will get to know many different villages and foes. Thankfully, Link will be able to move over long stretches of land faster thanks to \"Epona,\" your faithful horse. Epona also helps Link become a more effective fighter, as a number of powerful and impressive sword strikes can be launched while galloping through fields of enemies.The Twilight Realm awaitsLike most games in the Zelda franchise, Link begins his adventure with little more than the clothes he has on an an inkling that something has gone awry. After an initial trip to the Twilight Realm, in which Link appears as a wolf, a friendly shadow dweller named Midna will meet up with players and give helpful advice on gameplay. Fortunately for players, this virtual assistant spells out ways to be a more effective adventurer in and out of the shadow world. Early stages of the game have Link spending a lot of time in the Twilight Realm, and outdoor areas of Hyrule, attempting to clear areas of the strange darkness that has seemingly fallen over every village, forest, and field. As the story progresses, players will learn the cause of the shadows, and what they must to do vanquish them for good.Puzzling puzzlesLink once again finds himself in a number of classic Zelda-esque puzzle scenarios in which he must light torches to unlock doors, raise and lower water levels, and fight enemies to collect keys and open chests for valuable rupees. A number of the dungeons present unique puzzle challenges that rely on the player's ability to hone their Wii remote's control, such as an air castle in the sky that can only be accessed by an extremely accurate grappling hook toss.In general,Twilight Princessis more challenging than the average Zelda game, with a number of boss battles having protracted hit sequences with little support potions about, and even less warning. Still, there's never been an adventure experience such as this, wherein players can literally charge at a dungeon boss with their fists and punch the air to defeat an enormous foe. As the finest Zelda experience in almost ten years and the game fans have been waiting for,Twilight Princesswill delight young and old gamers alike.",

Eventually, they come to a crossroad. Standing in the crossroads, Sora gazes up at the night sky and thinks of his lost friends.From the distance, a mysterious man approaches from one of the roads. \"Ahead lies something you need,\" he says, \"but to claim it you must lose something dear.\" The man vanishes, revealing a single path that leads to the eery Castle Oblivion, which resembles a girl's drawing.The StoryAfter this encounter, Sora, Donald, and Goofy go their separate ways. Soon, on a night when his island home is besieged by a mysterious storm, Sora is whisked away to an unfamiliar burg known as Traverse Town. There he meets Donald and Goofy, and learns that there are strange things happening in the world.Donald and Goofy set off to look for their missing king, and Sora joins them to search for his lost friend, Riku. After a long journey that takes them across numerous worlds, Sora and friends finally find Riku and the lost king. But to save all the worlds, Sora must use his Keyblade to close the door to darkness, even though Riku and the king are on the other side. Believing the king's parting words --there will always be a door to the light-- Sora locks the door, and the trio sets out on yet another journey.The CharactersThe cast of Chain of Memories combines Kingdom Hearts characters with familiar Disney faces. Sora, is a 14-year-old boy and the hero of this tale. Although a little naive, Sora has an uncommon sense of justice. On his journey, Sora is accompanied by Donald, a court wizard who shares a striking resemblance to Donald the Duck of Disney fame, and the clumsy, easy-going captain of the Disney Castle Royal Knights, Goofy.Other characters include the mysterious, shrouded man from the crossroads; Sora's lost friend, Riku, a 15-year-old boy who is cool and collected; the lost King, who bares a striking resemblance to Mickey Mouse; and Kairi, a 14-year-old girl who's friends with Sora and Riku. Almost more strange than the man at the crossroads, a mysterious girl, Namine, draws pictures inside Castle Oblivion under close surveillance of an evil organization.

Humanity's collective intelligence will save the day, just as it has over the centuries. Ridley puts current perceptions about violence, wealth, and the environment into historical perspective, reaching back thousands of years to advocate global free trade, smaller government, and the use of fossil fuels. He confidently takes on the experts, from modern sociologists who fret over the current level of violence in the world to environmentalists who disdain genetically modified crops.

        "0061977969": "Amazon Best Books of the Month, September 2011: Neal Stephenson is quite rightly known as a writer of ideas, but don't put it past him to pen a straightforward thriller. True, the plot of said thriller hinges on a massively multiplayer online game that's a step beyond what's actually available on the Internet circa 2011, but that's as far as the sci-fi goes. Enter \"REAMDE,\" an online virus that brings together a super-rich CEO, a Chinese hacker, a rogue Russian mafioso, an assimilated East African beauty, an itinerant Hungarian software programmer, two insanely prolific fantasy writers, and guns, guns, guns. (The book features so much firepower that Stephenson enlisted what he calls a \"ballistics copy editor.\") It takes a veritable master of pacing to make a thousand pages feel like barely a third of that, but Stephenson is that master; his breakneck narrative starts fast and never, ever lets up. As such,Reamdeis as likely to turn off fans of his more cerebral fiction as it is to gain him scads of new devotees.

After 10 Stephanie Plum novels, each more successful than the last, Evanovich introduces Alexandra Barnaby, aka Barney. Barney hails from Baltimore rather than New Jersey, but she's from the same slice of working-class life as Stephanie; she donned mechanic's overalls in her father's garage during summer breaks from college. Her younger brother, Wild Bill, shares her passion for cars, and now he's disappeared from Miami, along with NASCAR star Sam Hooker's boat, theHappy Hooker. Evanovich doesn't mind showing her romance roots, as Barney and Sam start off snarling at each other; as any reader can tell, they have to team up (a) to save Bill and (b) to enjoy delicious sex. As in the Plum books, plot takes a back seat to riffs, roughups and dialogue&mdash;and in the last lies the book's most notable distinction. If Stephanie bids fair to be New Jersey's Dorothy Parker, Barney is Baltimore's echo of Robert Parker. Conversation is terse and coded, full of sexual innuendo, with a high premium on toss-away lines uttered under duress. Despite the amazing quantity of physical jeopardy, there's little tension; it's all about hanging out with Metro Girl and NASCAR Guy&mdash;which may be just what millions of Evanovich fans will want.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Well, you get this rollickin&#x2019; adventure in which Pocket, the royal fool introduced in Moore&#x2019;s Fool (2009), is lured to Venice, where he thinks he&#x2019;ll be having a fun time with the beautiful Portia, but where three men (including a fella named Iago) are actually planning to murder him. To some, the idea of combining two Shakespeare plays and an Edgar Allan Poe short story might be vaguely chilling. To begin with, Moore, author of such delights as Sacre Blue (2012) and The Stupidest Angel (2004), has to move the events of the plays from the late sixteenth century to the thirteenth to keep the chronology in line with the events recounted in Fool, which means &#x201C;Amontillado&#x201D; is moved roughly 500 years back in time. And let&#x2019;s not forget that the plays are tragedies, whereas this book, which also interpolates elements of King Lear, from which Fool was derived, is a farce. The upshot is, if you&#x2019;re the kind of reader who insists Shakespeare is untouchable, then this novel will probably annoy you on general principles. On the other hand, if you&#x2019;re a fan of Moore&#x2019;s brand of history-mangling humor, you&#x2019;ll dive right in with a big grin on your face. The grins win in the end. --David Pitt",

Brutally trained from birth to be a cold-hearted assassin whose services are available to the highest bidder, yet troubled by a past he can&#146;t entirely remember, Geralt is a classic anti-hero. To this most renowned of witchers, a society of mutants born with superhuman strength and reflexes and trained at a high level in magic and alchemy, killing has been and seemingly should remain a strictly commercial affair, but as questions about his past come to the fore, so do doubts surrounding the morality of his trade. And these doubts only grow when bits of his past are revealed as he and you grow in power and acclaim through the progression of the game.The Thin Line Between Good and EvilFar from a common black and white treatment of good and evil, the moral attitudes defining the world ofThe Witcherare as close to that of our own prevalent real world view as you are likely to see in a modern RPG. Set in a time dominated by vanity, greed and prejudice, there is no lack of work for Geralt as the kingdoms of the North forsake old alliances and give in to endless intrigue and purges instead of facing a growing tide of evil. But as despicable as the monsters, non-human enemies and pure human trash you are hired to eliminate may seem and may very well be, pity, mercy and good faith are nearly always a possible option to deadly force and one that can change Geralt&#146;s overall destiny. It&#146;s this kernel of reality in a universe peopled with fantastic and sometimes frightening beings and creatures against a backdrop of morally challenging scenarios that will keep players coming back for more as they explore the varying consequences of Geralt&#146;s choices and the choices forced upon him.Character DevelopmentA witcher's destiny is preordained at birth, but your goal is to determine Geralt's specific path. Hidden withinThe Witcherare a startling 250 in-game skills and abilities that allow you to define and in many cases plan the evolution of Geralt&#146;s character. Will he rely mainly on his skill with a blade? Develop into an arcane battle mage? Transform into a potent alchemist? Or meld all these skills into a more complicated, but potentially unbeatable combo of all three? Give some thought to your path, but know it will not always be an easy or thoughtful one. Filled with non-linear decision-making opportunities and consequences, expect to be forced into quick decisions, choices between the lesser of two evils and to invariably be stuck with the consequences of your employer&#146;s short-sighted plans for your services. It&#146;s these consequences that will determine your progression through the game&#146;s storyline and lead to the availability of different skills and abilities.Stunning Real-time CombatPossessing superior strength, speed and agility makes Geralt quick to draw his blade when conflict arises, but this birthright is not always the right skill to rely on and depending on the enemy, can prove disastrous. To survive in this world of varied threats you will need to put aside the button mashing common to other RPGs and utilizeThe Witcher&#146;s complex yet intuitive combat- based fighting system. You will learn quickly to switch seamlessly between the game&#146;s six combat styles, dozens of potions, complex alchemy and magic systems and weapons modification mode, using your mouse alone or mouse with keyboard, to add tactical depth to your combat experience. Once you have mastered these, you will also have time to appreciate the ground-breaking fluidity of the game&#146;s 600 in-game combat animations, based on actual medieval sword-fighting techniques and performed by experts at Frankfurt&#146;s renowned Metric Minds Studio.It&#146;s only through a combined focus on Geralt&#146;s physical and mental capabilities that you can hope to survive the viciously violent world he inhabits and unlock both his true potential as a warrior as well as the secrets hidden in his past.Complete Game Features:Geralt of Rivia: a one-of-a-kind protagonistA charismatic and unique character, Geralt is a mutant swordmaster and professional monster slayer.Choose from over 250 special abilities correlated to attributes, combat skills and magical powers to build the character in a way best suited to tactical needs and style of play.Original fantasy world drawn from literatureInspired by the writings of renowned Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski.Featuring adult themes, less fairy-tale than typical fantasy, with mature social issues like racism, political intrigue and genocide.It is a harsh world where nothing is black or white, right or wrong, often forcing players to choose between the lesser of two evils to advance.Non-linear and captivating storylineFull of turns, twists and ambiguous moral decisions which have real impact on the storyline.All quests can be accomplished in several ways and the game has three different endings depending on the player&#146;s actions and choices throughout the adventure.Visually stunning tactical actionEngage in complex yet intuitive real-time combat based on real medieval sword-fighting techniques.Motion capture performed by medieval fighting experts at Frankfurt&#146;s renowned Metric Minds studio, resulting in 600 spectacular and authentic in-game combat animations.Six combat styles, dozens of potions, complex alchemy system, modifiable weapons and powerful magic add tactical depth to the fluid real-time experience.",

        "0060005696": "Like Thoreau and the band Devo, psychology professor Schwartz provides ample evidence that we are faced with far too many choices on a daily basis, providing an illusion of a multitude of options when few honestly different ones actually exist. The conclusions Schwartz draws will be familiar to anyone who has flipped through 900 eerily similar channels of cable television only to find that nothing good is on. Whether choosing a health-care plan, choosing a college class or even buying a pair of jeans, Schwartz, drawing extensively on his own work in the social sciences, shows that a bewildering array of choices floods our exhausted brains, ultimately restricting instead of freeing us. We normally assume in America that more options (\"easy fit\" or \"relaxed fit\"?) will make us happier, but Schwartz shows the opposite is true, arguing that having all these choices actually goes so far as to erode our psychological well-being. Part research summary, part introductory social sciences tutorial, part self-help guide, this book offers concrete steps on how to reduce stress in decision making. Some will find Schwartz's conclusions too obvious, and others may disagree with his points or find them too repetitive, but to the average lay reader, Schwartz's accessible style and helpful tone is likely to aid the quietly desperate.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A driver who flees a car accident on a Maryland highway breathes new life into a 30-year-old mystery&mdash;the disappearance of the young Bethany sisters at a shopping mall&mdash;after she later tells the police she's one of the missing girls. As soon as the mystery woman drops that bombshell, she clams up, placing the new lead detective, Kevin Infante, in a bind, as he struggles to gain her trust while exploring the odd holes in her story. Deftly moving between past and present, Lippman presents the last day both sisters, Sunny and Heather, were seen alive from a variety of perspectives. Subtle clues point to the surprising but plausible solution of the crime and the identity of the mystery woman.

Such inspiration lends a tough, uncompromising realism to this stand-alone legal thriller. Scottoline (Killer Smile;Dead Ringer; etc.) sets the book in Philly, of course, and her lead this time is assistant U.S. Attorney Vicki Alegretti, whose petite frame belies her gutsy, unbridled determination on the job. While conducting a routine interview with a confidential informant on a straightforward matter, things go awry, and Vicki's partner&mdash;along with the informant&mdash;is shot. Resolved to find the killer, Vicki takes on the case (unbeknownst to her boss), and that's when the twists begin. In short chapters with cliffhanger endings, Scottoline spins a tale that finds Vicki joining forces with Reheema, a gorgeous black woman from the drug-ridden West Philly neighborhood of Devil's Corner. Reheema wants to find the person responsible for murdering her crack-addicted mother, and as she and Vicki play detective, they realize the murders may be connected and that they're getting increasingly closer to bringing down a sizable drug ring. Scottoline's ability to mix humor with serious subject matter, combined with her intense research of inner city drug trafficking and a side plot involving Vicki's love life, make for compelling entertainment.Agent, Molly Friedrich.

Sonic is joined by five of his friends in a massive quest that spans over 50 game levels filled with remarkable visuals and a pulsating soundtrack. Taking full advantage of the unprecedented processing power of the Dreamcast, Sega's development crew, Sonic Team, has designed several gravity-defying game levels that will keep gamers hooked.Our favorite level is Windy Valley, which requires you to survive the stormy perils of a tremendous tornado. This tyrant of nature chases you relentlessly before ultimately sucking you into the air and up through its eye. During the chase, the tornado manages to tear up just about everything on the screen. This dizzying visual spectacle moves so fast that you will literally hold on to the game controller for dear life.Assuming you survive the tornado, there are several more challenging areas to conquer, including a level that requires you to snowboard directly in the path of a fast-approaching avalanche. During the Emerald Coast level, you will race across a precarious dock as a killer whale attacks from below, destroying the wood planks underneath your feet while you attempt to outrun the crazed creature.We also liked the numerous mini-games scattered throughout this title. When you least expect it,Sonic Adventuretosses in some old-fashioned arcade action, such as pinball or bumper car racing. In between, you can raise virtual pets, known in the game as \"Chao.\" These characters, which are saved using the optional Visual Memory Unit (VMU), can be combined with other Chao characters exchanged between friends or downloaded via the Internet.Gamers looking to show off the strong processing power of the 128-bit Dreamcast will definitely want to pick up this title. Simply put,Sonic Adventure's graphics surpass those of any other game currently available on any home video game system. Let the Sonic assault begin.--Brett AtwoodPros:Strong replay valueStunning graphicsBonus virtual pet gameSix different game charactersCons:May be too fast-moving for some playersAwkward camera angles can inhibit gameplay in some areas",
        "0061931411": "*Starred Review* The second volume of the Rain Wilds Chronicles shows Hobb again working at the highest level of contemporary fantasy, to which her creativity with dragons adds additional&#x2014;there's no other word for it&#x2014;majesty. Battered, bruised, and lamed sea serpents have returned to the Rain Wild River to lay eggs that will hatch into dragons. But the dragon hatchlings are feeble, misshapen, unable to fly. They can't even survive without the assistance of human Dragon Keepers. Keepers and dragons make a perilous foray up the river in search of the long lost Elderling city of Kelsingra, which possibly holds the key to the dragons' survival. Tight bonds unite the humans to their ancient liveship Tarma, but as they voyage upriver they find the landscape hideously altered by earthquakes and storms. Starvation stalks them, and the bonds among humans, at least, fray even without any open treachery gnawing at them. The Rain Wilds is one of the most gripping settings in modern fantasy, highly to Hobb's credit, and an entire novel amid its lowering trees and rock formations would be impossible to put down even without Hobb's superior skills at characterization. Let us applaud, and shelve this with the rest of Hobb's magisterial fantasy fiction, though it won't stay on the shelf long. --Roland Green",

Beaumont (Birds of Prey, etc.) and Cochise County, Ariz., Sheriff Joanna Brady (Paradise Lost, etc.). When artist Rochelle Baxter is murdered in Bisbee, Ariz., Brady's department is stunned that Baxter's next of kin is not a person but the Washington State Attorney General's Office. Baxter was Latisha Wall, an industrial whistle-blower in a Washington witness protection program pending her testimony at an important trial. Beaumont, now an investigator for the AG, is sent to Arizona to determine if Wall's cover was blown. The enraged Brady interprets his arrival as personal criticism; Beaumont feels uncomfortable with her resentment and with being in the hometown of his second wife, the serial killer Anne Rowland Corley. After a second murder, the two investigators develop mutual respect and even a physical attraction. The convoluted plot builds to a surprising solution, though the floundering romance ultimately comes off as forced. The most frightening feature is the cause of death--sodium azide, an odorless, tasteless, unregulated chemical used in automobile air bags. Jance highlights the differences between her two protagonists by alternating Beaumont's first-person narration (despite her Seattle sleuth's dislike of Arizona's desolate scenery, the author describes it beautifully) with Brady's third-person chapters, which show how Brady, her staff and family handle pressure.Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

Cole has successfully captured the youngsters' voices, making it easy for readers to identify with them, whether the books are being read aloud or alone. Familiar situations, as well as positive reinforcement of individuality and importance as part of the family, are good reasons to put this book into the hands of children who will soon be older siblings. A concluding \"Note to Parents\" in each book offers suggestions on how to communicate with older children about the changes that are coming. Like the texts, the engaging illustrations are the same in both books. Aside from the obvious difference of a boy in one and a girl in the other, the scenes are set up the same?the family at the park, looking at pictures, the father and older sibling giving the baby a bottle, etc. Unfortunately, the artist differentiates between a big brother and a big sister by showing the boy playing with trucks and building blocks, while the girl entertains dolls at a tea party. Sadly, due to these pictures, boys are unlikely to read about the big sister, which makes a case for a library to purchase both titles.

        "0061097314": "Feisty Marietta Greer changes her name to \"Taylor\" when her car runs out of gas in Taylorville, Ill. By the time she reaches Oklahoma, this strong-willed young Kentucky native with a quick tongue and an open mind is catapulted into a surprising new life. Taylor leaves home in a beat-up '55 Volkswagen bug, on her way to nowhere in particular, savoring her freedom. But when a forlorn Cherokee woman drops a baby in Taylor's passenger seat and asks her to take it, she does. A first novel, The Bean Trees is an overwhelming delight, as random and unexpected as real life. The unmistakable voice of its irresistible heroine is whimsical, yet deeply insightful. Taylor playfully names her little foundling \"Turtle,\" because she clings with an unrelenting, reptilian grip; at the same time, Taylor aches at the thought of the silent, staring child's past suffering. With Turtle in tow, Taylor lands in Tucson, Ariz., with two flat tires and decides to stay. The desert climate, landscape and vegetation are completely foreign to Taylor, and in learning to love Arizona, she also comes face to face with its rattlesnakes and tarantulas. Similarly, Taylor finds that motherhood, responsibility and independence are thorny, if welcome, gifts. This funny, inspiring book is a marvelous affirmation of risk-taking, commitment and everyday miracles.Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

After all, when Ellen Grier and  her family return to the rural hamlet of Holly's Field, Wisconsin, it's not exactly a happy homecoming. Her husband, James, has been laid off from  his job in Illinois. And for the moment, the family has moved in with  Ellen's in-laws, Fritz and Mary-Margaret, an unhappy pair who dislike their daughter-in-law almost as much as they despise each other:The first time Ellen sat at this table she was twenty years old, bright-cheeked after a spring afternoon spent walking along the  lakefront with James, planning their upcoming wedding. It was 1959 and she was  eager to make a good impression. She didn't know then that Mary-Margaret  disliked her, that she was consideredJimmy's mistake.Thirteen years later, in 1972, Ellen is back at the table with no  escape in sight. Both she and her husband do find work. Yet James seems to  settle a tad too easily into his old life, and shows no interest in finding a place of their own. Even worse, his job takes him away from home for  weeks at a time, leaving Ellen to cope with her abusive in-laws.InVinegar HillAnsay paints a searing portrait of the Midwest's dark side, of a rural culture infected with despair and ruled over by  an unforgiving God. Yet she does hold out a grain of hope, too. Just as  Ellen seems permanently entangled in familial desperation, she makes a  surprising discovery about James's long-dead grandmother--a woman whose rebellious spirit inspires Ellen to rescue herself and her loved ones from the impinging darkness. This late-breaking redemption doesn't cancel out  the preceding unhappiness:Vinegar Hillremains a tough,  uncompromising tale, one that requires some fortitude to read.

His brutal observations on waiting tables at an upscale restaurant he called The Bistro (outed as Lanterna Tuscan Bistro in Nyack, N.Y.) are expanded in this entertaining audio.

Miller's vocal interpretation dovetails seamlessly with the material. He shines when the Waiter is dishing it out, but even more so when he's taking it.

        "0060755350": "Raised by her wise and loving immigrant mom and uncle, Lauren Bacall (b. 1924) knew, even in high school, that she wanted to be an actress. She took acting classes, modeled clothes, sold industry papers in the theater district, ushered at shows, danced at the USO&mdash;anything to get a break. Barely 18 when director Howard Hawks brought her to Hollywood for a screen test, she soon fell in love with Bogart, married and started a family. After Bogart's death a decade later, she rebounded with Sinatra, but tied the knot with Jason Robards before finding her way as a single woman, with friends and work as her passion. Bacall's intimates&mdash;from Katharine Hepburn to Adlai Stevenson&mdash;weren't the standard air-kissing, gossip-column regulars, but people who loved and respected each other for their work and their values. Sadly, like Bogart, they're also of a generation older than Bacall, so there's a lot of dying in these pages. Indeed, this sequel to 1978'sBy Myselfis mostly a discussion of the deaths of some great friends: Roddy McDowall, John Gielgud, Gregory Peck and many more. Bacall does discuss the roles she's played as an older actress, but this work's real theme is the experience of surviving the death of so many wonderful friends. Readers looking for basic Hollywood romance and drama can stick to the first 400 pages; those seeking a more mature portrait can brave the final 100. Either way, Bacall's a class act.

The late Philip, Viscount Ashton, had a passion for classical antiquity, and Emily, in an attempt to get to know her husband postmortem, uses her newfound independence in London to study it. In the process, she forms a friendship with Cecile du Lac, a Parisian of a certain age, and realizes that there was more to Philip than she realized&mdash;including his genuine passion and love for her. The charming Colin Hargreaves may have been involved with Philip in art forgeries, and Andrew Palmer proposes to Emily and then offers evidence that Philip is still alive. By this time, Emily and Cecile are a well-practiced team of amateur sleuths: Phillip's secrets begin to emerge, and travel to Greece provides the possibilities of a new life. Alexander makes Emily light but sympathetic, and conveys period flavor without being ponderous. Her knowledge of the ethical dilemmas posed by Victorian etiquette is considerable; sexual chemistry in particular is handled with exquisite delicacy.

        "0099448572": "InSouth of the Border, West of the Sun, the arc of an average man's life from childhood to middle age, with its attendant rhythms of success and disappointment, becomes the kind of exquisite literary conundrum that is Haruki Murakami's trademark. The plot is simple: Hajime meets and falls in love with a girl in elementary school, but he loses touch with her when his family moves to another town. He drifts through high school, college, and his 20s, before marrying and settling into a career as a successful bar owner. Then his childhood sweetheart returns, weighed down with secrets:When I went back into the bar, a glass and ashtray remained where she had been. A couple of lightly crushed cigarette butts were lined up in the ashtray, a faint trace of lipstick on each. I sat down and closed my eyes. Echoes of music faded away, leaving me alone. In that gentle darkness, the rain continued to fall without a sound.Murakami eschews the fantastic elements that appear in many of his other novels and stories, and readers hoping for a glimpse of the Sheep Man will be disappointed. YetSouth of the Border, West of the Sunis as rich and mysterious as anything he has written.  It is above all a complex, moving, and honest meditation on the nature of love, distilled into a work with the crystal clarity of a short story. A Nat \"King\" Cole song, a figure on a crowded street, a face pressed against a car window, a handful of ashes drifting down a river to the sea are woven together into a story that refuses to arrive at a simple conclusion.  The classic love triangle may seem like a hackneyed theme for a writer as talented as Murakami, but in his quietly dazzling way, he bends us to his own unique geometry.--Simon Leake--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

Having lived in China for a decade now, fluent in Mandarin and working as a correspondent in Beijing, Hessler displays impressive knowledge, research and personal encounters as he brings the country's peoples, foibles and history into sharp focus. He frames his narrative with short chapters about Chinese artifacts: the underground city being excavated at Anyang; the oracle bones of the title (\"inscriptions on shell and bone\" considered the earliest known writing in East Asia); and he pays particular attention to how language affects culture, often using Chinese characters and symbols to make a point.A talented writer and journalist, Hessler has courage&mdash;he's undercover at the Falun Gong demonstrations in Tiananmen Square and in the middle of anti-American protests in Nanjing after the Chinese embassy bombings in Belgrade&mdash;and a sense of humor (the Nanjing rioters attack a statue of Ronald McDonald since Nanjing has no embassies). The tales of his Fuling students' adventures in the new China's boom towns; the Uighur trader, an ethnic minority from China's western border, who gets asylum after entering the U.S. withjiade(false) documents; the oracle bones scholar Chen Mengjia, who committed suicide during the Cultural Revolution&mdash;all add a seductive element of human interest.There's little information available in China, we learn, but Hessler gets the stories that no one talks about and delivers them in a personal study that informs, entertains and mesmerizes.

What she never counted on was discovering her fianc&eacute;, A.J. Jernigan, cavorting with her maid of honor in the middle of her rehearsal dinner. She pitches a hissy fit that reverberates through her tiny hometown of Madison, Ga., and captures the attention of Will Mahoney, a newcomer who recently purchased an antebellum plantation house. Headstrong, freckled Will pressures Keeley to restore the rundown mansion within six months. His plan: to woo a woman whom he has seen only on television by designing the house of her dreams by Christmas. Keeley knows it's an insane plan, but the Jernigans are now trying to put her out of business, so she begrudgingly accepts. As the house comes together, Keeley discovers links between the Jernigan legacy of infidelity and her mother's disappearance many years ago. Darker than the book's fluffy title suggests, this black comedy is riven with shocking secrets. And Keeley's vast knowledge of all things antique offers a fascinating peek into the luscious world of designer home furnishing, sure to make readers drool with envy over sideboards and sofas.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Before she's captured, Campbell uses her cellphone to get off a call for help to Bethany Stewart, her colleague in the shadowy outfit known as Tangent. Stewart, in turn, recruits Travis Chase, who was once briefly involved in a Tangent operation, and reveals to him the existence of an \"entity\" resembling a dark metal cylinder that opens a hole in time. Since the entity has shown a horrific future for humanity, Chase and Stewart, who suspects the president was behind the motorcade attack, must scramble to save their friend and forestall devastation in the years to come. Lee imaginatively blends a Baldacci-like political tale of betrayals and assassination with time travel in a thoughtful science-fictional thriller. (Jan.)(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

        "0060572140": "This memoir of Patchett's friendship withAutobiography of a Faceauthor Lucy Grealy shares many insights into the nature of devotion. One of the best instances of this concerns a fable of ants and grasshoppers. When winter came, the hard-working ant took the fun-loving grasshopper in, each understanding their roles were immutable. It was a symbiotic relationship. Like the grasshopper, Grealy, who died of cancer at age 39 in 2002, was an untethered creature, who liked nothing more than to dance, drink and fling herself into Patchett's arms like a kitten. Patchett (The Patron Saint of Liars;Bel Canto) tells this story chronologically, in bursts of dialogue, memory and snippets of Grealy's letters, moving from the unfolding of their deep connection in graduate school and into the more turbulent waters beyond. Patchett describes her attempts to be a writer, while Grealy endured a continuous round of operations as a result of her cancer. Later, when adulthood brought success, but also heartbreak and drug addiction, the duo continued to be intertwined, even though their link sometimes seemed to fray. This gorgeously written chronicle unfolds as an example of how friendships can contain more passion and affection than any in the romantic realm. And although Patchett unflinchingly describes the difficulties she and Grealy faced in the years after grad school, she never loses the feeling she had the first time Grealy sprang into her arms: \"[She] came through the door and it was there, huge and permanent and first.\"Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0062114875": "Gr 8 Up-Everyone is born with a twin: two souls-one body. Only, in America, it's illegal to remain that way-to be a hybrid. The dominant soul is supposed to take over, and the recessive, or weaker one is supposed to disappear, usually by the time the child is six. But even though Addie was the stronger soul, Eva held on. Despite the fact that she could no longer move or speak to anyone but Addie, she didn't go away. Now that they are teens, Addie and Eva have adopted rules of behavior in order to survive: don't stand out, don't be exceptional, blend in at all costs. But then the girls become friends with Hally and her brother, Devon, and the siblings show the sisters that there's another way to live-Eva can reemerge. But Eva's freedom comes at high price: imprisonment in a hospital that wants to \"cure\" kids of being hybrids and where patients who \"go home\" are never heard from again. This uniquely imagined novel doesn't fall short in the execution. Zhang's prose is lovely, and the plot is compelling to the last page. If there's one complaint to be made it's that the differences in characterization of the hybrid siblings are very subtle, and it's occasionally difficult to immediately see the change when different personalities take over. It will be easy to categorize this book as yet another dystopian novel, but it is remarkable and will stand out from the rest.-Heather M. Campbell, formerly at Philip S.

If you are about to crack open Joe Hill's chilling thrillerHeart-Shaped Box, you might want to rethink your nighttime habits--Hill's story about an aging rock star (with a penchant for macabre artifacts) who buys a haunted suit online will scare you silly. But don't take our word for it. We asked bestselling authors (and masters of dark terror tales themselves)Scott Smith, andHarlan Cobento readHeart-Shaped Boxand give us their take. Check out their reviews below, and you might want to pick up anightlightwhile you're at it.--Daphne DurhamGuest Reviewer: Scott SmithIn 1993, Scott Smith wowed readers with his stunning debut thriller,A Simple Plan.  Thirteen years later, he spooked us again withThe Ruins, a horror-thriller about four Americans traveling in Mexico who stumble across a nightmare in the jungle.The set-up for Joe Hill's novel,Heart-Shaped Box, is appealingly simple. Jude Coyne, an aging rock star, buys himself a dead man's suit. He acquires it online, lured by the promise that the dead man's ghost will be included in his purchase. Jude thinks this is a joke, of course. He also assumes the seller is a stranger. We soon discover that he's wrong on both counts, however, and from this point on the story moves with an exhilarating urgency. Jude wants the ghost gone; the ghost wants Jude dead. We watch, chapter-by-chapter, as they battle for survival. \"Watch\" is the appropriate word, too, because this is an extremely visual book. Hill's prose is lean and precise, and he renders Jude's world with impressive confidence. It feels solid, every detail both correct and fresh. And this physicality provides a firm platform for the book's otherworldly happenings, which seem all the more frightening for being so securely grounded.Hill has a flawless sense of pacing. His narrative never flags, nor does it ever move so quickly as to outrun itself. And one can sense his literary ambition pushing at the margins of the genre. There are times when his writing, for all its spare efficiency, seems to jump away from him, stopping one small step short of poetry. An e-mail to Jude from the ghost (trust me, it's not as absurd as it sounds) could even pass for something ee cummings might've written, in an especially morbid mood. And toward the end of the book, when Hill describes a trip down death's \"night road\" in a '65 Mustang, the passage has a startlingly lyrical beauty.The story's horror ultimately has as much to do with Jude Coyne's past--his mistakes, abandonments and betrayals--as with anything supernatural. Jude has caused a lot of pain over the years, moving through life with a carelessness that verges on the callous. His battle with the ghost brings this behavior into sharp relief, forcing him to reflect upon his own capacity for cruelty. This dawning self-awareness leavens the book's bleakness and gore (and it is delightfully gory in places) with an unexpected sweetness. Despite our initial impression, Jude is gradually revealed--both to himself and the reader--as an essentially decent, even kind man. It's this kindness, this fledgling ability to love and be loved, that will ultimately be of crucial consequence in his death struggle with the ghost. And it's what makes Hill's debut not only well-written and terrifying, but also--as it draws to its close--surprisingly moving. So go ahead, take a chance, and open hisHeart-Shaped Box. I think you&#x92;ll be happy you did.--Scott SmithGuest Reviewer: Harlan CobenHarlan Cobenis the author of the belovedMyron Bolitarseries about a wisecracking sports agent, as well as stunning stand-alone novels likeThe Innocentand his breakout thrillerTell No One.

He demands revenge for his step-daughter&#x92;s death, which he blames on Judas&#x92;s shabby treatment of her.Or is he after something else?There are Amazon readers who will give you a better plot summary. Don't read them too closely because Joe Hill provides plenty of fun surprises.Heart-Shaped Boxis a true spine-tingler.  I don&#x92;t use that hyphenated word much anymore. We have seen and read it all, haven't we?  But right away, in the first chapter, there was a subtle line that made the hairs on the back of my neck go up in a way I haven't experienced since I first discovered great horror as a teenager.Hill writes with a sure hand. The prose is compelling. Like most memorable tales of horror, this book is more about redemption than scary moments--thoughHeart-Shaped Boxhas plenty of scares. They are visceral, shocking and very well done. The characters are flawed and real. The father-son relationship adds texture and surprising poignancy.So here's the thing. My guess is, you won&#x92;t find a ghost to buy online, but if you read theHeart-Shaped Box, you will be getting something that will haunt you and startle you and stay with you and yes, visit you in your dreams.Sleep well, dear reader.--Harlan Coben",

Noted medievalist Norman Cantor tells the story of the pandemic and its widespread effects inIn the Wake of the Plague.After giving an overview, Cantor describes various theories about the medical crisis, from contemporary fears of a Jewish conspiracy to poison the water (and the resulting atrocities against European Jews) to a growing belief among modern historians that both bubonic plague and anthrax caused the spiraling death rates. Cantor also details ways in which the Black Death changed history, at both the personal level (family lines dying out) and the political (the Plantagenet kings may well have been able to hold onto France had their resources not been so diminished).Cantor veers from topic to topic, from dynastic worries to the Dance of Death, and from peasants' rights to Perpendicular Gothic. This makes for amusing reading, though those seeking an orderly narrative may be frustrated. He also seems overly concerned with rumors of homosexual behavior, and his attempt to link the savage method of Edward II's murder to a cooling in global weather is a bit farfetched.Cantor wears his considerable scholarship lightly, but includes a very useful critical biography for further reading. While not an entry-level text on the Black Death,In the Wake of the Plaguewill interest readers looking for a broader interpretation of its consequences.--Sunny Delaney--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

She grows up with a sweet, tragic father, a severely realistic mother, and an aunt who gives her love too freely--to men, and to a brother who will always be the favored child. Francie learns early the meaning of hunger and the value of a penny. She is her father's child--romantic and hungry for beauty. But she is her mother's child, too--deeply practical and in constant need of truth. Like the Tree of Heaven that grows out of cement or through cellar gratings, resourceful Francie struggles against all odds to survive and thrive. Betty Smith's poignant, honest novel created a big stir when it was first published over 50 years ago. Her frank writing about life's squalor was alarming to some of the more genteel society, but the book's humor and pathos ensured its place in the realm of classics--and in the hearts of readers, young and old.

In the spirit ofBlinkandPredictably Irrational(but with a large helping of erudition), journalist Schulz casts a fresh and irreverent eye upon the profound meanings behind our most ordinary behaviors&mdash;in this instance, how we make mistakes, how we behave when we find we have been wrong, and how our errors change us. [I]t is ultimately wrongness, not rightness, that can teach us who we are, she asserts. Schulz writes with such lucidity and wit that her philosophical enquiry becomes a page-turner. She deftly incorporates Wittgenstein, Descartes, and Freud, along with an array of contemporary social scientists and even a spin with Shakespeare and Keats. There's heavy stuff here, but no heavy-handedness. Being wrong encompasses the cataclysmic (economic collapse) and the commonplace (leaving a laptop in front of the window before the storm). Being wrong may lead to fun (playing with and understanding optical illusions) or futility (the Millerite expectation of the Rapture in 1844). Being wrong can be transformative, and Schultz writes, I encourage us to see error as a gift in itself, a rich and irreplaceable source of humor, art, illumination, individuality, and change&mdash;an apt description of her engrossing study.(June)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Flash forward eight years: his career has cratered, and her biggest accomplishment has been briefly marrying hunky star Lance Marks, who abandons her for sex-goddess-turned-international-do-gooder Jade Gentry. So when Bram and Georgie wake up from a Vegas bender and find themselves married to each other, they make the most of it: Georgie aims to undo the damage Lance has done to her heart and her public image, while Bram is gunning for a second chance at life, love and stardom. It's a blast to watch the hate-each-other-yet-made-for-each-other couple as they duck paparazzi or spar before falling into bed.

But this tough gal from  New Jersey, an unemployed discount lingerie buyer, has a much more  interesting story to tell: She has to say that her Miata has been repossessed and  that she's so poor at the moment that she just drank her last bottle of beer  for breakfast. She has to say that her only chance out of her present rut  is her repugnant cousin Vinnie and his bail-bond business. She has to say  that she blackmailed Vinnie into giving her a bail-bond recovery job worth  $10,000 (for a murder suspect), even though she doesn't own a gun and has never apprehended a person in her life. And she has to say that the guy she  has to get, Joe Morelli, is the same creep who charmed away her teenage virginity behind the pastry case in the Trenton bakery where she worked after school.If that hard-luck story doesn't sound compelling enough, Stephanie's several unsuccessful attempts at pulling in Joe make a downright  hilarious and suspenseful tale of murder and deceit. Along the way, several more outlandish (but unrelentingly real) characters join the story,  including Benito Ramirez, a champion boxer who seems to be following Stephanie  Plum wherever she goes.Janet Evanovich shares an authentic feel for the streets of Trenton in  her debut mystery (she developed her talents in a string of romance novels before creating Ms. Plum), and her tough, frank, and funny first-person narrator offers a winning mix of vulgarity and sensitivity.

It's as fulminating and crammed with infuriating facts as any right-wing bestseller, as irreverent asThe Onion, and as noisily entertaining as a wrestling smackdown. Moore offers a more interesting critique of the 2000 election than Ralph Nader'sCrashing the Party(he argued with Nader, his old boss, who sacked him), and he's serious when he advocates ousting Bush. But Moore's rage is outrageous, couched in shameless gags and madcap comedy: \"Old white men wielding martinis and wearing dickies have occupied our nation's capital.... Launch the SCUD missiles! Bring us the head of Antonin Scalia!... We are no longer [able] to hold free and fair elections. We need U.N. observers, U.N. troops.\" Moore's ideas range from on-the-money (Arafat should beat Sharon with Gandhi's nonviolent shame tactics) to over-the-top: blacks should put inflatable white dolls in their cars so racist cops will think they're chauffeurs; the ever-more-Republicanesque Democratic Party should be sued for fraud; \"no contributions toward advancing our civilization ever came out of the South [except Faulkner, Hellman, and R.J.

        "B0002TB4CW": "Early Adopters Pick: March 2003. As the  world's smallest video-game platform, the Game Boy Advance SP is also the first to use a built-in rechargeable battery.Many decried the original Game Boy Advance's reflective LCD screen and its reliance on external light sources. The Game Boy Advance SP's main feature--optional backlighting--fixes this complaint nicely, but it's the wealth of other features that makes this system so surprisingly good.At first look, you might think the SP is a sleek travel alarm clock. When closed, it's just as tall and deep as the original GBA, but only half as wide. Due to its clamshell design, the screen is always protected from everyday scratches. A small button in the center of the console turns on the backlighting element for use in low-light situations, like in a moving car.The SP comes with a well-designed power adapter that recharges a built-in battery; its prongs fold in for easier storage. Our informal tests found that it takes about four hours to fully charge (you can even play it while it's plugged in and charging), and the battery lasts about 11 hours with the backlighting constantly on--your results may vary. Using the backlighting less often will conserve battery power.With  separately sold  cables, you can connect the Game Boy Advance SP to other GBAs  for multiplayer gaming (above) or to the  Nintendo GameCube  (below) to access secret levels, exchange data, or use other special  features that vary from game to game.The quality of the backlighting is very good. It's bright and clear when looking directly at it, but degraded from other angles. This is only a problem for friends who are watching the screen from over your shoulder.But size, power, and affordability do not come without trade offs. There's no headphone jack here, though Nintendo promises an adapter. The system isn't very loud at its highest volume, and the sound can be turned down to socially acceptable levels. The L and R shoulder buttons are a fraction of the size they were on the GBA, and thus are harder to hit. Also, the reduced size of the SP is slightly less comfortable for adult hands than the GBA, but perhaps more comfortable for smaller hands. The cartridge port placement on the lower part of the console is fine for GBA games, since they are flush with the console body, but older Game Boy Color carts will stick out in a way that takes some getting used to.Open it up and the hinge will seek out a preferred, pre-set angle (about 150 degrees), though you can open it a bit wider or narrower for your own comfort. The hinge stands up well to lateral pressure, and over all, the SP seems just as rugged as its predecessor--which has proven to be very rugged, indeed.--Porter B.

        "0060838574": "As true crime books go, this addition to the Scott and Laci Peterson library isn't particularly riveting, salacious or revealing, which is strange considering Bird's unique perspective. Adopted as a child, Bird reunited with her birth mother, Jackie Peterson, Scott's mother, in late 1997. Bird takes every opportunity to stress that she grew very close to the Peterson family, but there's very little evidence of this apart from Bird's own assertions. The reader learns tidbits about Scott and Laci: i.e., Laci loved flowers, and Scott \"was a real charmer, the kind of guy who lights up a room.\" But such details hover on the surface. In fact, this book reveals more about the author's self-delusional behavior than the crime itself. Laci's abduction occurs early on, and for the rest of the book, Bird relates how, despite all evidence to the contrary, she refused to believe her brother could be guilty. Her denial is such that, after Scott's arrest, Bird writes letters to him in which she replaces the word \"jail\" with \"camp.\" Despite Bird's frequent protestations, one wonders if she isn't disingenuous at times. She professes her love for her birth mother, for example, yet paints her in an unflattering light (\"I was beginning to understand why Jackie was so critical of Laci. No one was good enough for her golden boy\"). With the help of a therapist, Bird finally accepts the evidence and devises her list of 33 reasons why her brother is guilty. This list-which takes up a mere five pages and offers such banal reasons as Scott \"flirted with our babysitter\"-is just as superficial as the rest of the book.

        "0061725471": "Brown tells the story of her family&#x2019;s battle with anorexia, the &#x201C;demon&#x201D; that suddenly possesses her bright, pretty daughter, Kitty. Brown is alternately an introspective and anguished parent and a fierce advocate for the Maudsley approach, a family-based therapy that focuses on restoring the patient to physical health before fully dealing with the psychological challenges he or she faces. Brown carefully amasses facts about anorexia and the effects of starvation in between bouts at the dinner table as Kitty refuses to eat and, occasionally, hides her food. The standoffs are emotionally draining for the entire family, including Kitty&#x2019;s younger sister, Emma, whom Brown worries is also at risk for the disease. At the crux of Brown&#x2019;s affecting and informative memoir is the idea that anorexia can happen to any family and that it can be defeated through determination and love, even though Brown recognizes that permanent success can be elusive. In the end, she knows that all any family can do is try, and that her eldest daughter will not be left to fight her demon alone. --Katherine Boyle",
        "0060738170": "Starred Review.In the absence of any original manuscripts of the books of the New Testament, how can we be sure that we're getting the intended words and meaning? Ehrman, professor of religion at UNC&ndash;Chapel Hill, has devoted his life to the study of such questions and here offers an engaging and fascinating look at the way scholars try to answer them. Part memoir, part history and part critical study, he traces the development of the academic discipline called textual criticism, which uses external and internal evidence to evaluate and compare ancient manuscripts in order to find the best readings. Ehrman points out that scribes altered almost all of the manuscripts we now have. In the early days of the Christian movement, scribal error often arose simply from unintentional omissions of words or lines. As Christianity evolved into an official religion under Constantine, however, scribes often added material to existing manuscripts or altered them to provide scriptural support for Christian doctrine or to enforce specific views about women, Jews or pagans. Ehrman's absorbing story, fresh and lively prose and seasoned insights into the challenges of recreating the texts of the New Testament ensure that readers might never read the Gospels or Paul's letters the same way again.(Nov.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It would be easy to stay on the dirt path that defines the race track, but if you plan on truly winning inExcite Truck, you have to go off road and in the air. Your true success in each race is based on a star system. The more stars you get by performing stunts, drifts and more, the better your rank.Netting lots of stars is not for the feint of heart. You'll need to cruise through fields of trees, launch yourself high in the air, hang on around curves for dear life and smash the daylights out of other trucks.

Instead of its traditional vertical configuration, you hold it in a horizontal fashion, like the center bar of a steering wheel. You move the remote in the same fashion that you would a car steering wheel, tilting your right hand up if you want to turn left and your left hand up if you want to go right. When your truck goes airborne, its front end will lean toward the ground if you tilt the Remote away from you, and if you tilt the Remote toward to, your truck's front end will point up, allowing you to catch a little more air. If you catch enough air, you can try to pull off a 720 and, if you're daring enough, a 1080. The more midair spins you can perform, the more stars you earn. Plus, remember tilting your arms while playingExcitebiketo try to make your character land a huge jump?

Who can she count on as she confronts these angry and suspicious townspeople?A thoroughly exciting and rewarding Newbery Medal winner and ALA Notable Children's Book, Elizabeth George Speare'sThe Witch of Blackbird Pondbrings this frightening period of witch hysteria to life. Readers will wonder at the power of the mob mentality, and the need for communities in desperate times--even current times--to find a scapegoat.

Like all beloved historians, Armstrong entertains us with deft storytelling, astounding research, and makes us feel a greater appreciation for the present because we better understand our past. Be warned:A History of Godis not a tidy linear history. Rather, we learn that the definition of God is constantly being repeated, altered, discarded, and resurrected through the ages, responding to its followers' practical concerns rather than to mystical mandates. Armstrong also shows us how Judaism, Christianity, and Islam have overlapped and influenced one another, gently challenging the secularist history of each of these religions.--Gail Hudson--This text refers to thePaperbackedition.",

        "0060959037": "There is no one in contemporary literature quite like Barbara  Kingsolver. Her dialogue sparkles with sassy wit and earthy poetry; her  descriptions are rooted in daily life but are also on familiar terms with the  eternal. WithProdigal Summer, she returns fromthe Congoto a \"wrinkle on the map  that lies between farms and wildness.\" And there, in an isolated pocket of  southern Appalachia, she recounts not one but three intricate stories.Exuberant, lush, riotous--the summer of the novel is \"the season of extravagant  procreation\" in which bullfrogs carelessly lay their jellied masses of eggs in  the grass, \"apparently confident that their tadpoles would be able to swim  through the lawn like little sperms,\" and in which a woman may learn to \"tell  time with her skin.\" It is also the summer in which a family of coyotes moves  into the mountains above Zebulon Valley:The ghost of a creature long extinct was coming in on silent footprints,  returning to the place it had once held in the complex anatomy of this forest  like a beating heart returned to its body. This is what she believed she would  see, if she watched, at this magical juncture: a restoration.The \"she\" is Deanna Wolfe, a wildlife biologist observing the coyotes from her  isolated aerie--isolated, that is, until the arrival of a young hunter who makes  her even more aware of the truth that humans are only an infinitesimal portion  in the ecological balance. This truth forms the axis around which the other two  narratives revolve: the story of a city girl, entomologist, and new widow and  her efforts to find a place for herself; and the story of Garnett Walker and  Nannie Rawley, who seem bent on thrashing out the countless intimate lessons of  biology as only an irascible traditional farmer and a devotee of organic  agriculture can. As Nannie lectures Garnett, \"Everything alive is connected to  every other by fine, invisible threads. Things you don't see can help you  plenty, and things you try to control will often rear back and bite you, and  that's the moral of the story.\"Structurally, that gossamer webisthe story: images, phrases, and events  link the narratives, and these echoes are rarely obvious, always serendipitous.  Kingsolver is one of those authors for whom the terrifying elegance of nature is  both aesthetic wonder and source of a fierce and abiding moral vision. She may  have inherited Thoreau's mantle, but she piles up riches of her own making,  blending her extravagant narrative gift with benevolent concise humor. She  treads the line between the sentimental and the glorious like nobody else in  American literature.--Kelly Flynn--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

        "0099472287": "Four women who work the night shift in a Tokyo factory that produces boxed lunches find their lives twisted beyond repair in this grimly compelling crime novel, which won Japan's top mystery award, the Grand Prix, for its already heralded author, now making her first appearance in English. Despite the female bonding, this dark, violent novel is more evocative of Gogol or Dostoyevsky than Thelma and Louise. When Yayoi, the youngest and prettiest of the women, strangles her philandering gambler husband with his own belt in an explosion of rage, she turns instinctively for help to her co-worker Masako, an older and wiser woman whose own family life has fallen apart in less dramatic fashion. To help her cut up and get rid of the dead body, Masako recruits Yoshie and Kuniko, two fellow factory workers caught up in other kinds of domestic traps. In Snyder's smoothly unobtrusive translation, all of Kirino's characters are touching and believable. And even when the action stretches to include a slick loan shark from Masako's previous life and a pathetically lost and lonely man of mixed Japanese and Brazilian parentage, the gritty realism of everyday existence in the underbelly of Japan's consumer society comes across with pungent force.

James Stark spent 11 years killing monsters in Lucifer's arena for the entertainment of fallen angels, but now he's back in seedy, magic-riddled L.A., trying to avenge his girlfriend's murder and hunt down Mason Faim, the black magician responsible for getting him sent downtown. He meets with some initial success, beheading second-rate magician Kasabian (whose head becomes Stark's smart-mouthed sidekick), but he can't find Faim. Instead he encounters Homeland Security agents, a near-psychotic angel and some odd nonhuman, nonangelic beings called the kissi.

Readers will giggle as she tries to lick the faraway moon and gets a bug on her tongue, or leaps to catch it and falls down the stairs. In an effective refrain, the narrator repeats, \"Still, there was the little bowl of milk, just waiting.\" The winning combination here is the simplicity and humor of the story, paired with gorgeous black-and-white illustrations with thick black lines (mirrored by the thick bold sans-serif font) and shades of grey that are as luminous as a moonlit night should be. Full-moon circles and ovals appear throughout the design: white circle full moons on the endpapers, elliptical flowers by the porch, white circles of firefly light, oval pads on Kitten's paws, and her big round eyes (especially when surprised and soaking wet).

Her mother's remarried, her boyfriend Austin's in college and dating her best friend, and her fastidious father has become a drunken conspiracy theorist who believes she was abducted by aliens. The only comfort and support she gets is from Austin's little brother, Tyler, an extremely grown-up and very cute 17-year-old.

Against Fletcher&#x2019;s wishes, Pandora sends Edison a plane ticket to Iowa; when he arrives, she almost doesn&#x2019;t recognize him owing to the &#x201C;hundreds more pounds&#x201D; he carries than when she last saw him.

In the hands of writers such asDavid James DuncanandNorman Maclean, the simple, repetitive motions of baseball, fly-fishing, and golf have acquired almost numinous significance. InThe Tennis Partner, Dr. Abraham Verghese takes on his own fascination with tennis and comes up with as good an explanation as any: \"In the way we controlled the movement of a yellow ball in space, we were imposingorderon a world that was fickle and capricious. Each ball that we put into play, for as long as it went back and forth between us, felt like a charm to be added to a necklace full of spells, talismans, and fetishes, which one day add up to an Aaron's rod, an Aladdin's lamp, a magic carpet. Each time we played, this feeling of restoring order, of mastery, was awakened.\"For both Verghese and his tennis partner, a fourth-year medical student named David Smith, the game is a much-needed island of order in the midst of personal chaos. Both men are struggling to rebuild their lives, Verghese undergoing a painful divorce, Smith struggling with an intravenous cocaine addiction. For a brief, idyllic period, their friendship flourishes; Verghese mentors Smith in the examining room, while Smith, an Australian who competed briefly on the pro circuit, ends up Verghese's teacher on the court. But there are dark corners to David's personality, and under the mounting pressures of medical school and his increasingly complicated love life, these come to the fore. Even as he learns how to inhabit his new life, Verghese watches with horror as his friend relapses, dries out, then relapses again. The author of the powerfulMy Own Country, a chronicle of caring for AIDS patients in rural Tennessee, Verghese once again proves that the skills of a good doctor are strikingly similar to those of a good writer. Careful observation, compassion, restraint: these are the instruments Verghese uses to stunning effect inThe Tennis Partner. A paean to the healing powers of tennis, this book is also a moving meditation on friendship, fatherhood, love, addiction, and the particular loneliness of physicians.--Mary Park",

There may be catharsis in those kinds of stories, but there's often little joy, which is what makes this quiet and tender debut so disarmingly good.Stiltsvilleis a story of a marriage that begins with serendipity--that holiest of relationship grails--one warm summer day in Miami. It's 1969 when girl (Frances, the novel's clear-eyed, guileless narrator) meets boy (Dennis, who in Frances's estimation is \"careless but lucky\") at one of a copse of houses built on stilts in Miami's Biscayne Bay. That such a place existed is incredible now, and in the scenes that reconstruct its peculiar beauty, Susanna Daniel ushers you into an exotic and unpredictable corner of the country. It's a perfect place to fall in love, and Frances and Dennis do, without fanfare or pretense. Theirs is a love that almost instantly becomes constant and real, full of simple happiness that makes it possible to weather the storms that come. --Anne BartholomewCurtis Sittenfeld Interviews Susanna DanielCurtis Sittenfeld, author ofPrep,The Man of My Dreams, andAmerican Wife, andSusanna Daniel, author of the debut novelStiltsville, met at the Iowa Writers&rsquo; Workshop. Here they talk about friendship and its role in&mdash;and beyond&mdash;novels.Curtis Sittenfeld: One of the many things I love aboutStiltsvilleis that it starts with the main character, Frances, making a new friend, Marse, and then pretty much immediately falling for the guy Marse likes. Yet these two women become very close, even though only one of them can get the guy. Were you consciously defying stereotypes about female friendship, or did this just feel like the organic way to depict these characters?Susanna Daniel: There's a lot of bad press out there regarding female friendships, which are so much more nuanced than stereotypes would have us believe. When Frances meets Dennis, her friendship with Marse is just beginning, but already they both know there's potential. Neither woman wants to throw that away. There's a moment when Frances tells Marse that it's not like her to flirt with -- not to mention steal -- another woman's guy, and their future pretty much hinges on Marse believing her. Which she does. To grant your friend permission to pursue what might turn out to be the love of her life -- that's a sign of trust and humility, which Marse is strong enough to give.CS: So much ofStiltsvilleis about Frances' marriage to Dennis. I'm wondering how you think getting married and having children -- or not getting married and not having children when the people around you are -- changes the nature of women's friendships.SD: I think there's a lot of truth to the idiom that it takes a village --not only to raise a child, but to support a marriage. Because their lives take such different paths, Frances and Marse must make exceptions for each other that they might not make for other friends. Their differences might have divided them, but instead, Marse becomes a member of Frances' family in a way that a married friend could never be. Late in the book, Frances says that Marse had been almost like a second wife to Dennis in some ways, over the years. But she loves and trusts Marse like a sister, and when Marse's life changes unexpectedly, Frances must look outside her own troubles to support her friend the way she's been supported for so long.CS: Two of Frances' best friends are her daughter, Margo, and her sister-in-law, Bette. What are the particular pleasures and complications of friendships with family members?SD: Bette, Dennis's sister, is one of the most complicated characters of the book. In order to forge a friendship early on, Frances must become a confidante of Bette's, which isn't an easy thing to do. Unlike Marse, who remains in Frances' daily life until the end, Bette has to choose between family and love partway through the book -- and the choice she makes breaks Frances' heart. But later, Frances has to make a similar choice with regards to Margo. Moving away from family, inStiltsville, is not a choice made lightly or without a lot of heartache, but sometimes it's the only way for a character to grow.CS: You and I met in 1999, on our first day as graduate students at the Iowa Writers' Workshop, when we were the only two women in a class of eight. One of the most frequent questions I get about having attended the Workshop is whether it's competitive and back-stabbing. How do you answer this question?SD: The program is definitely competitive in nature, though not back-stabbing. Writing isn't a team sport -- ultimately it's all about you and what you produce. No one can undermine you if you're focused and ambitious. That said, workshopping material is not for the faint of heart -- not because people are back-stabbing but because they are bright, experienced readers, and devastatingly honest. At the same time, I'm grateful for the Workshop for many reasons, not the least of which is that it's where I met the woman who continues to be my great reader, advocate, and friend: you.CS: You're the friend I've learned the most from because you're so smart and opinionated, and you also see the world in a really different way than I do. But now that we're publicly exposing our friendship, do you think it will go the way of Gwyneth and Winona's? Also, in this scenario, which of us will end up shoplifting from Saks and which of us will dispense frittata recipes on a lifestyle website?SD: I think I'm the boring domestic of the two of us, so it might be me with the web site (I think you probably disagree with this assessment). But then again, you're staunchly ethical, so I can't see you going the way of Winona. I think a better model for our friendship, which I'm proud to publish, is that of Ann Patchett and Elizabeth McCracken, two writers who for decades have read for each other and supported each other while living in different cities. What I hope is that we continue to enjoy the differences between us -- as writers, mothers, wives, friends -- and never let them distance us. When we met, we hadn't yet made the decisions that would root our lives, as we have now. I look forward to a future when maybe we don't live so far apart, and maybe our kids play independently together while we kick back and read magazines and talk about what Winona and Gwyneth are up to these days. Because who even remembers that they were friends once, except the two of us?",
        "0060529709": "The simplest thing would be to describeEverything Is Illuminated, Jonathan Safran Foer's accomplished debut, as a novel about the Holocaust. It is, but that really fails to do justice to the sheer ambition of this book. The main story is a grimly familiar one. A young Jewish American--who just happens to be called Jonathan Safran Foer--travels to the Ukraine in the hope of finding the woman who saved his grandfather from the Nazis. He is aided in his search by Alex Perchov, a na&#xEF;ve Ukrainian translator, Alex's grandfather (also called Alex), and a flatulent mongrel dog named Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. On their journey through Eastern Europe's obliterated landscape they unearth facts about the Nazi atrocities and the extent of Ukrainian complicity that have implications for Perchov as well as Safran Foer. This narrative is not, however, recounted from (the character) Jonathan Safran Foer's perspective. It is relayed through a series of letters that Alex sends to Foer. These are written in the kind of broken Russo-English normally reserved for Bond villains or Latka fromTaxi. Interspersed between these letters are fragments of a novel by Safran Foer--a wonderfully imagined, almost magical realist, account of life in the shtetl before the Nazis destroyed it. These are in turn commented on by Alex,  creating an additional metafictional angle to the tale.If all this sounds a little daunting, don't be put off; Safran Foer is an extremely funny as well as intelligent writer who combines some of the best Jewish folk yarns since Isaac Bashevis Singer with a quite heartbreaking meditation on love, friendship, and loss.--Travis Elborough, Amazon.co.uk--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

        "B00005Q8M4": "It's often argued that Nintendo makes the best video games in the world,  but one thing the company isn't known for is scary games. If you thoughtLuigi's Mansionwas  frightening, then quite frankly you've led a sheltered life.Eternal  Darkness: Sanity's Requiem, however, is the real deal: it's scary, it's  gory, and it's really nothing likeResident Evilat all.The game starts when you find out your grandfather has had his clogs popped by  some unspeakable monster. While rummaging through his stuff (alone, at night, in  his huge mansion) you come across a jolly little hardback calledThe Tome of  Eternal Darkness, and upon reading it you suddenly find yourself controlling  a Roman centurion in 26 B.C. Persia. And this is how the game continues--you  find and read a passage of the book in the mansion and then control a series of  11 completely different characters over the course of two millennia.Apart from the innovative structure of the game, the other big selling points ofEternal Darknessare its sanity effects--every time you see a monster and  fail to kill it your sanity level will drop. If it drops too far, you start  seeing things: flies walking along the inside of your screen, messages telling  you your controller is unplugged when it clearly isn't, and all sorts of other  clever freakery.The game's not perfect, though; the combat is a little too fiddly, and it's  still not quite as scary asSilent Hill, butEternal Darknessis  an unusual and rewarding title that should finally shut up those annoying twerps  that insist Nintendo only makes games for kids.--David Jenkins--Amazon.co.uk",

Some were also taken aback by the book's length&#x2014;over 800 pages for a figure who famously lived only to age 40. But most reviewers concluded that the bulk of this biography was appropriate, not only because Norman is the first author to investigate Lennon in such detail but because his sense for which details are interesting (a well-developed portrayal of the young Lennon's Liverpool) and which are not (Beatles ephemera) keeps the book moving at a steady pace.Copyright 2008 Bookmarks Publishing LLC",

        "0060256656": "To say that this particular apple tree is a \"giving tree\" is an understatement. In Shel Silverstein's popular tale of few words and simple line drawings, a tree starts out as a leafy playground, shade provider, and apple bearer for a rambunctious little boy. Making the boy happy makes the tree happy, but with time it becomes more challenging for the generous tree to meet his needs. When he asks for money, she suggests that he sell her apples. When he asks for a house, she offers her branches for lumber. When the boy is old, too old and sad to play in the tree, he asks the tree for a boat. She suggests that he cut her down to a stump so he can craft a boat out of her trunk. He unthinkingly does it. At this point in the story, the double-page spread shows a pathetic solitary stump, poignantly cut down to the heart the boy once carved into the tree as a child that said \"M.E. + T.\" \"And then the tree was happy... but not really.\" When there's nothing left of her, the boy returns again as an old man, needing a quiet place to sit and rest. The stump offers up her services, and he sits on it. \"And the tree was happy.\" While the message of this book is unclear (Take and take and take?  Give and give and give? Complete self-sacrifice is good? Complete self-sacrifice is infinitely sad?), Silverstein has perhaps deliberately left the book open to interpretation. (All ages)--Karin Snelson",

        "0061929387": "*Starred Review* Crichton, who died in 2008, was known primarily for such high-tech thrillers as Jurassic Park and The Andromeda Strain. This new novel, found in manuscript form among his papers, will come as a bit of a surprise to many of his fans. It is, of all things, a pirate novel. Set in 1665, it tells the story of Captain Charles Hunter, a privateer who&#x2019;s hired by the governor of Jamaica&#x2019;s Port Royal to steal a Spanish galleon and its cargo of gold treasure. Don&#x2019;t expect to see Jack Sparrow in this story of pirates of the Caribbean, though: Crichton doesn&#x2019;t play his pirates for laughs. And this is no typical pirate adventure, either: it&#x2019;s actually a caper novel posing as a high-seas adventure. All the key caper-novel elements are here: the target, the mastermind, the plan, the motley crew, the ruthless villain, the gadgets, the twist, and the turncoat. Crichton keeps us in a constant state of suspense, never revealing quite what his hero, Captain Hunter, has up his sleeve, and the novel ends most unexpectedly. Pirate fans will love the book for its flashy characters and historical authenticity. Crime fans will enjoy the caper-novel structure and the way the author keeps them on their toes. If this really is Crichton&#x2019;s final book, it&#x2019;s a splendid send-off: something new, different, and daring. --David Pitt--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

When she injures her arm in an accident, she discovers a network of wires and tubes beneath her skin that hints at a history more incredible than she could have ever imagined. Mila doesn't remember her previous life because she doesn't have a past: she was created in a top-secret laboratory for the government. Now she and her mother are running for their lives and nothing makes sense-all she has are questions. Who is her mother? Did her father ever actually exist? Why was she created? And who is chasing her? In this cross between Robert Ludlum's The Bourne Identity (Richard Marek, 1980) and Mary E. Pearson's The Adoration of Jenna Fox (Holt, 2008), Mila's identity crisis and the resulting questions about what it means to be human could be the start of an interesting discussion.

        "0099464462": "This highly original first novel won the largest advance San Francisco-based MacAdam/Cage had ever paid, and it was money well spent. Niffenegger has written a soaring love story illuminated by dozens of finely observed details and scenes, and one that skates nimbly around a huge conundrum at the heart of the book: Henry De Tamble, a rather dashing librarian at the famous Newberry Library in Chicago, finds himself unavoidably whisked around in time. He disappears from a scene in, say, 1998 to find himself suddenly, usually without his clothes, which mysteriously disappear in transit, at an entirely different place 10 years earlier-or later. During one of these migrations, he drops in on beautiful teenage Clare Abshire, an heiress in a large house on the nearby Michigan peninsula, and a lifelong passion is born. The problem is that while Henry's age darts back and forth according to his location in time, Clare's moves forward in the normal manner, so the pair are often out of sync. But such is the author's tenderness with the characters, and the determinedly ungimmicky way in which she writes of their predicament [...] that the book is much more love story than fantasy. It also has a splendidly drawn cast, from Henry's violinist father [...] to Clare's odd family and a multitude of Chicago bohemian friends. [...] It is a fair tribute to her skill and sensibility to say that the book leaves a reader with an impression of life's riches and strangeness rather than of easy thrills.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

His latest is a virtual literary paella of adult and children's fantasies: Jack the Ripper, A Christmas Carol, Alice in Wonderland, Peter Pan, The Exorcist even a wafting glimpse of Dracula. The result is a deftly written, compulsively readable modern-day ghost story that easily elicits suspension of disbelief. American writer Winifred Rudge, whose mass market book about astrology has been far more successful than her fiction, is in London to research a novel linking Jack the Ripper to the house in Hampstead where her own great-great-grandfather rumored to be the model for Ebenezer Scrooge lived. But as Winifred discovers, there is no evidence that the Ripper ever visited Hampstead, let alone buried one of his victims inside the chimney of a house there, and his presence in the story is a red herring. Much more interesting is the mysterious disappearance of Winnie's cousin, John Comestor, the latest resident of the family house. Moreover, something is making an infernal racket inside the chimney, and soon there are other bizarre manifestations of some unseen force. A Dickensian assortment of neighbors (one dotty lady is called Mrs. Maddingly) variously obfuscate and hint at strange events. Maguire's prose is both jaunty and scary; he knows how to mix spooky ingredients with contemporary situations. By the time a spirit called Gervasa begins to speak through Winnie, readers will be hooked.Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

Lucky for us, he brought a notebook.With a razor wit and a kind heart, Bryson serves up a colorful tale of boredom, kitsch, and beauty when you least expect it. Gentler elements aside,The Lost Continentis an amusing book. Here's Bryson on the women of his native state: &quot;I will say this, however--and it's a strange, strange thing--the teenaged daughters of these fat women are always utterly delectable ... I don't know what it is that happens to them, but it must be awful to marry one of those nubile cuties knowing that there is a time bomb ticking away in her that will at some unknown date make her bloat out into something huge and grotesque, presumably all of a sudden and without much notice, like a self-inflating raft from which the pin has been yanked.&quot;Yes, Bill, but be honest: what do you really think?",
        "B00009WAUK": "You can almost hear the collective drooling of RPG and Game Boy fans worldwide. As the inaugural Nintendo/Square reunion title,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancehas a lot to live up to--and it does, spectacularly!The long heralded Final Fantasy series has enjoyed a number of spin-offs and sequels. Using the familiar character types and classes of the Final Fantasy series, but with a wholly original storyline,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancecreates an immersive world of strategic combat and conquest.Snow JobWhile most fantasy games favor romantic landscapes,Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceslyly starts out in a plain-vanilla suburb. Players assume the role of young Marche Radiuju in the humble burg of St. Ivalice.A snowball fight introduces the characters and sets the groundwork for future battles. After a brief (but chilly) skirmish, Marche heads home to visit his younger brother.Marche MadnessSoon after, Marche's friends drop by to show him an ancient book of mysterious origins. After failing to translate the text properly, Marche's friends leave for the evening. After a wistful slumber, Marche awakens and realizes he isn't in Ivalice anymore... or is he?Alone in a foreign land, Marche quickly comes under the care of a helpful creature known as a Moogle. It doesn't take much to convince Marche to adopt a lucrative career as a mercenary.Gangs of IvaliceA quick stop at the town inn introduces Marche to his new gang. A motley crew at best, your associates include low-level monks, mages, archers, and soldiers. The only hope you have of finding your way home is to turn your ragtag group of misfits into a finely tuned fighting force.Begin your tour of duty by chatting up the local barkeep. He'll clue you in to interesting news bits, rumors, and job opportunities. Due to your severe lack of experience, early quests are little more than errands.As you gain experience and reputation, your job options grow as well as the rewards. You can also send one of your crew members on side missions for extra swag. You cannot use these members in your regular quests until they return from their mission.Rules of EngagementWhether your quest is to fetch rare herbs or escort the local nobleman, you can always expect bad company. The battlefield is set up from an isometric 3D viewpoint, allowing clear view of every character in play.At the start of a match, you must choose which members of your gang you wish to take into battle with you. You have a clear view of the enemies before choosing, so try to match your lineup to your opposition.Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceintroduces an innovative law system to the series. During every battle, an impartial judge decrees specific rules, such as banning poison attacks or physical attacks. The judges' unpredictability requires players to keep a well-rounded group of characters at all times.Technically, you can break the combat laws, but it is generally not recommended. Even if you win the battle, any of your characters who breaks a law is whisked away to prison. They can only be released after paying a hefty fine.Fantasy FightingThe battlefield is set up like a 3D chessboard, with elevations and terrain types. In each turn, a character can move a specific number of spaces and perform a single action, such as attack or using an item.Most strategy games employ either real-time or turn-based action.Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceemploys a speed-based system that is somewhere in-between.Characters still take turns to move and perform actions, but these are based on each character's individual speed ratings. Nimble characters like rogues and ninjas are usually the first characters to go and can usually move farther than other characters. The downside is that faster characters typically lack strong armor and health stats.Subtle details such as terrain type and attack proximity can have a direct affect on your ability to hit an enemy. Attacking an enemy from behind or the side will yield much higher hit percentages than head-on attacks.Job FairWhat you do off the battlefield is arguably more important than what you do on it. Thanks to a stable economy, your characters can usually change job classes once they gain enough experience.Need a little more magic in your life? Try turning one of your grunts into a mage. There are more than 30 different job classes available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.Even in far-off fantasy lands, commercialism is a way of life. You'll be amazed at how quickly you'll end up spending your hard-earned greenbacks on shiny new stuff. Weapons and armor serve not only to boost your stats, but also grant special abilities to specific character types and species.While one sword might grant tremendous attack points, a seemingly lesser sword may give its wielder access to a special attack that can tip the scales in your favor. Thanks to the law system, one should never get too attached to a single piece of equipment.Face ValueGorgeous character illustrations and 2D sprites harken back to Square's 16-bit glory days. Each of the shops, inns, towns, and fields is superbly detailed, with subtle background animations.Final Fantasy Tactics Advancemaintains the series' stellar rep for technically and visually brilliant summon attacks.Uniquely,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancefeatures three separate display settings, depending on whether you're playing on the Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Advance SP, or the Game Boy Player. Each setting offers different levels of brightness, contrast, and saturation to appease even the most fickle of gamers.The only thing that can rival the on-screen wonders is the audio candy. It is no surprise why Square Enix's soundtracks are the most sought-after in the video game community.Lasting PowerNeedless to say, there are hours upon hours of gameplay packed into this tiny little cartridge. Square Enix has done a tremendous job in creating an easily accessible yet incredibly deep gameplay experience. Plug into one of the finest strategy RPG experiences ever created withFinal Fantasy Tactics Advance.",

Although the Arkham asylum is well fortified, he has a nagging feeling that all is not well, which proves to be the case when seconds after turning The Joker over to the guards, the master criminal breaks free of his captors. Even more surprising than this quick turn of events is the revelation that it was never The Joker's intent to escape the vault-like facility, but instead to trap Batman there. Surrounded by an asylum full of dangerous criminals, many of which he put there and all at the beck and call of the Joker, can Batman survive and discover what is behind the Joker's intricate plot?GameplayInBatman: Arkham Asylumplayers strap on the gadget-heavy utility belt of the Caped Crusader. Gameplay here is a combination of both the knuckle crunching rush of hand to hand combat as you take on the hordes of thugs that infest Arkham Asylum, and stealth gameplay in which you must dispatch individuals from the shadows. Players can expect an engrossing single player campaign in which Batman continually moves forward to face the henchmen, bosses and traps that The Joker has set for him. With regards to opponents, in addition to The Joker who you will hear more than you see, the dark walls of Arkham also hold familiar villains from the the Batman criminal universe including Harley Quinn, Victor Zsasz and Killer Croc, that you will have to deal with, but don't expect a one-dimensional experience. As players progress from environment to environment within Arkham they will have to use varying combinations of muscle, detective skills, gadgetry and a certain degree of light RPG-like leveling of Batman's skills, arsenal and physical characteristics to survive and discover what The Joker's underlying scheme is.In addition to the story-driven single player campaignArkham Asylumalso contains various additional play modes. These include an arcade styled combat mode where players accumulate points by engaging hordes of thugs in a hand to hand slugfest across a series of maps, in which Batman's physical strength and agility play a major role. The key here is to chain together as many attacks as possible due to the fact that with each successful combo players increase the point multiplier associated with their actions. The game also features a time-based stealth mode where players must hone their ability to strike silently from the shadows. This gameplay, referred to as 'Invisible Predator' utilizes the Dark Knight's skill with gadgets like the grapple tool, batarang and explosives. These allow for vertical/horizontal mobility, the ability to quickly strike from above and at a distance and to take out enemies and create distractions, even through walls. But remember that Batman works solo and is not superhuman. Your enemies will congregate around trouble areas and work as a team against you, so you must be silent, plan your attacks wisely, strike quickly and discover the value of encouraging fear within enemies.Key FeaturesExperience the game in a whole new way with Game of the Year Edition extras including: Access to the playable Joker character (in the PS3 version only) and 4 additional standard challenge maps.Utilize the unique FreeFlow combat system to chain together unlimited combos seamlessly and battle with huge groups of The Joker's henchmen in brutal melee brawls.Investigate as Batman, the world's greatest detective, by solving intricate puzzles with the help of cutting edge forensic tools including x-ray scanning, fingerprint scans, 'Amido Black' spray and a pheromone tracker.Face off against Gotham's greatest villains including The Joker, Harley Quinn, Victor Zsasz and Killer Croc.Become the Invisible Predator with Batman's fear takedowns and unique vantage point system to move without being seen and hunt enemies.Choose multiple takedown methods, including swooping from the sky and smashing through walls, and use the predator camera get a closer look at the action.Explore every inch of Arkham Asylum and roam freely on the infamous island, presented for the first time ever in its gritty and realistic entirety.Experience what it's like to be Batman using batarangs, explosive gel aerosol, the Batclaw, sonar resonator and the line launcher.Unlock more secrets by completing hidden challenges in the world and develop and customize equipment by earning experience points.Enjoy complete superhero freedom in the environment with the use of Batman's grapple to get to any place you can see, jump from any height and glide in any direction.",

In the best of the book's three essays, \"Men Without Chests,\" Lewis trains his laser-sharp wit on a mid- century English high school text, considering the ramifications of teaching British students to believe in idle relativism, and to reject \"the doctrine of objective value, the belief that certain attitudes are really true, and others really false, to the kind of thing the universe is and the kinds of things we are.\" Lewis calls this doctrine the \"Tao,\" and he spends much of the book explaining why society needs a sense of objective values.The Abolition of Manspeaks with astonishing freshness to contemporary debates about morality; and even if Lewis seems a bit too cranky and privileged for his arguments to be swallowed whole, at least his articulation of values seems less ego-driven, and therefore is more useful, than that of current writers such as Bill Bennett and James Dobson.--Michael Joseph Gross--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

As the narrator of this audio edition, Knox sounds authentic, sincere, and vulnerable. In early portions of the narrative related to the crime scene and arrest, her emotions are muted, conveying the same deer-in-the-headlights reaction for which she was skewered in media coverage at the time. Yet, while recounting her experiences in prison after being convicted, when she grasped the gravity of the situation, Knox conveys her sense of desperation during a process in which the cards seemed hopelessly stacked against her. Her conversations with a sympathetic prison chaplain and with her deeply loyal family and close friends are especially moving. In her recitation of legal details, Knox falls into occasional lapses in pronunciation, but given the weight of the personal aspects of her performance, these flaws prove minor and don't detract from the listening experience.

Julius Hertzfeld, a successful therapist in San Francisco, is shocked by the news that he suffers from terminal cancer. Moved to reassess his life's work, he contacts Philip Slate, whose three years of therapy for sexual addiction Julius describes as an \"old-time major-league failure.\" Philip is now training to be a therapist himself, guided by the writings of Arthur Schopenhauer, and he offers to teach Julius about Schopenhauer as a way of helping him deal with his looming death. Julius and Philip strike a deal: Julius will serve as Philip's clinical supervisor, but only if Philip joins the ongoing therapy group Julius leads. To complicate matters further, Pam, a group member, is one of the hundreds of women Philip seduced and then rejected. Yalom often refers to his books as \"teaching novels,\" and his re-creation of a working therapy group is utterly convincing. At the same time, his approach can be overly documentary, as the inner workings of therapy, often repetitious and self-referential, absorb much of the novel's momentum. A parallel account of Schopenhauer's life sheds light on the philosopher's intellectual triumphs and emotional difficulties.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0099526409": "First published in 1970, this extraordinary book changed the way Americans think about the original inhabitants of their country. Beginning with the Long Walk of the Navajos in 1860 and ending 30 years later with the massacre of Sioux men, women, and children at Wounded Knee in South Dakota, it tells how the American Indians lost their land and lives to a dynamically expanding white society. During these three decades, America's population doubled from 31 million to 62 million. Again and again, promises made to the Indians fell victim to the ruthlessness and greed of settlers pushing westward to make new lives. The Indians were herded off their ancestral lands into ever-shrinking reservations, and were starved and killed if they resisted. It is a truism that \"history is written by the victors\"; for the first time, this book described the opening of the West from the Indians' viewpoint. Accustomed to stereotypes of Indians as red savages, white Americans were shocked to read the reasoned eloquence of Indian leaders and learn of the bravery with which they and their peoples endured suffering. With meticulous research and in measured language overlaying brutal narrative,Dee Brownfocused attention on a national disgrace. Still controversial but with many of its premises now accepted,Bury My Heart at Wounded Kneehas sold 5 million copies around the world.

The answers, my friend, are in Neil Strauss's entertaining bookThe Game. Strauss was a self-described chick repellant--complete with large, bumpy nose, small, beady eyes, glasses, balding head, and, worst of all, painful shyness around women. He felt like \"half a man.\" That is, until a book editor asked him to investigate the community of pickup artists. Strauss's life was transformed. He spent two years bedding some fine chiquitas and studying with some of the North America's most suave gents--including the best of them all, the God of the pickup \"community,\" a man named Mystery.Mystery is an aspiring Toronto magician who charges $2,250 for a weekend pickup workshop. He is not much to look at: a cross between a vampire and a computer geek. But by using high-powered marketing techniques he's turned seduction into an effortless craft--even inventing his own vocabulary. His technique sounds like a car salesman's tip sheet: his main rule is FMAC--find, meet, attract, close. He employs the \"three-second rule\"--always approach a woman within three seconds of first seeing her in order to avoid getting shy. Other tricks: Intrigue a beautiful woman by pretending to be unaffected by her charm; also, never hit on a woman right away. Start with a disarming, innocent remark, like \"Do you think magic spells work?\" or \"Oh my god, did you see those two girls fighting outside?\" And finally, the most important characteristic of the pickup artist--smile.After two years, Strauss ends up becoming almost as successful as Mystery, but he comes to an important realization. His techniques were actually off-putting to the woman he ended up falling in love with. And they never prepared him for actually having a relationship. After a while, he ran out of one-liners and had to have a real conversation. Still,The Gameis a great read that may help some AFCs come out of their shells.--Alex Roslin",

The quartet comprises not only Amelia's diary of those years but also parts of a mysterious \"Manuscript H,\" an omniscient viewpoint that allows a glimpse into the minds of Amelia's son--the dashing and brilliant Ramses--and her ward, Nefret Forth, as they mature into adults with their own secrets and agendas.The Falcon at the Portalleft readers hanging impatiently in the enormous rift that book's events gouged between Ramses and Nefret, both madly in love but unrelentingly proud.The winter of 1914-15 finds the Peabody-Emerson family back in Cairo--now under British martial law, with the Suez Canal under constant threat of attack from the Ottoman Empire. The city's young Englishmen are rushing to enlist, except for Ramses, who is widely scorned for his pacifism. Yet Amelia and Emerson soon find out that Ramses is (literally) playing a mysterious and potentially explosive part in the conflict between Egyptian nationalists and the British authorities, for reasons both political and familial. Nefret, for her part, is still running a health clinic for the city's fallen women and trying to avoid the attentions of Percy, Amelia's odious nephew. In the meantime, the Emersons' excavations at Giza reveal an unexpected treasure so remarkable that the uneasy Amelia immediately senses the fine hand of Sethos, the Master Criminal (who through many previous books has alternately plagued her and protested his boundless affection for her), at work. The climax and denouement are entirely worth the price of admission--tying up a decade's worth of loose strings and explaining some nagging points so subtle that less observant readers might easily have missed them. It's Peters's great gift that in the grand scheme of things, no clues are wasted. Her plotting is wonderfully complex and intriguing, and it fits seamlessly into the detailed historical background she builds so carefully. It may have taken years for her to complete this four-part dance (she promises more Amelia Peabody mysteries in the future), but she's charmed us right out of our dancing slippers along the way.--Barrie Trinkle--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

        "0061233781": "Amazon Best Books of the Month, October 2010: It's April 1865 and General Lee's troops have officially surrendered. Abraham Lincoln, looking forward to rebuilding the nation, celebrates with an evening&mdash;his last alive&mdash;at the theater. On the other side of the Mason-Dixon Line Jefferson Davis plans to move the Confederate government to North Carolina, away from Union troops that have captured Richmond. Under much different circumstances, both men embark on a dramatic final journey depicted by James. L. Swanson inBloody Crimes, a gripping account of the weeks following Lincoln&rsquo;s death and the end of the Civil War. While arguments erupted about where and how Lincoln&rsquo;s burial should take place, Jefferson Davis&mdash;refusing to let the South succumb&mdash;attempted to rally his people despite being hunted by Northern troops who suspected his involvement in Lincoln&rsquo;s assassination. Using relics and key documents of the day, Swanson juxtaposes the travels of Davis and Lincoln, weaving a fast-paced narrative that lures readers in from the get-go. We know that eventually Lincoln makes it to his final resting place and Davis is captured, but along the way it&rsquo;s hard not to wonder if these two heroic leaders were more similar than perhaps anyone would have guessed. Whether read as a companion toManhunt&mdash;Swanson&rsquo;s account of the 12-day search for John Wilkes Booth&mdash;or on its own,Bloody Crimesis the next great Civil War-era read worthy of the recognition that Lincoln once said we should all strive for.  --Jessica ScheinAmazon Exclusive: James L. Swanson on WritingBloody CrimesI wroteBloody Crimesas a way of answering a question manyManhuntreaders asked:  &ldquo;What happened next?&rdquo;  InManhuntI told just one of the three incredible stories that unfolded at the climax of the Civil War.  I could only hint at the strange and amazing things that happened to Lincoln&rsquo;s body after he died, and I could do no more than allude to Jefferson Davis&rsquo;s dramatic flight from Richmond and his six week odyssey to save the Confederacy. So it would be correct to say thatBloody Crimesis a sequel toManhunt.Since I was a child, I&rsquo;ve been fascinated by the Lincoln funeral train, and I debated whether to write a book about that story alone.  It is hard for a modern reader to comprehend how much Lincoln&rsquo;s death, the White House funeral, the Pennsylvania Avenue procession, and the president&rsquo;s sojourn home to Illinois influenced America.  Imagine the death of President Kennedy and intensify by several degrees the emotions it released.  As I researched the Lincoln funeral pageant, I began thinking about another president on his great journey.  As I studied Davis, I realized that he is one of the &ldquo;Lost Men&rdquo; of American history.  Today we know so little about him.  To my great surprise, he and Lincoln had much in common.  Some of their shared experiences were stunning, even profound.  And in April 1865, both presidents left their White Houses, took to the field, and sought to rally their armies at the climax of the war.Combining the final journeys of Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis into one book presented several challenges.  I needed to return to the assassination, but I did not want to repeat material fromManhunt. I solved that problem by, like a film director, shifting the camera and pointing it in a different direction.  InManhunt, my camera captured every moment of action inside Ford&rsquo;s Theatre. InBloody Crimes, that camera never sets foot inside Ford&rsquo;s, but instead takes position inside the Petersen House, capturing the assassination through fresh eyes, those of the boarders who lived there and the visitors who descended upon it.  InManhunt, once Lincoln was dead, he ceased to be a principal character in the book.  InBloody Crimes, though Lincoln is dead, he remains a vital character until the end.  One of the pleasures of writing the book was meeting the splendid cast of characters who played significant roles in the death pageant, including the larger-than-life Commissioner of Public Buildings in Washington, D.C., Benjamin Brown French, who kept an amazing diary.Another great pleasure was experiencing the final journey of Jefferson Davis through the firsthand accounts of his inner circle, cabinet members, young female loyalists, and his family, especially Davis&rsquo;s wife Varina.  The love letters they exchanged during his darkest days go unread today, but they are as moving as the correspondence of John and Abigail Adams.I cannot write a book without holding in my hand the original sources&mdash;Civil War newspapers, documents, photos, and artifacts&mdash;and I must visit the sites where history happened.  Through these objects and places, I travel back in time and, I hope, take my readers with me.  Many of the places I visited while writingBloody Crimesstill haunt me: The Confederate White House, where toys still lie upon the floor, as if the Davis children will return momentarily to continue their play;  the East Room of Lincoln&rsquo;s White House, site of his majestic funeral;  the cemetery vault in Georgetown, where Abraham Lincoln&rsquo;s dead son Willie waited for his father to claim him and bring him home to Illinois;  and the graves of Jefferson Davis and his family at Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond.  Indeed, shortly before the publication ofBloody Crimes, I visited the grave of Jefferson Davis.  A powerful storm had twisted and torn from the ground a mighty oak tree that had, for the past century, offered shade to Davis&rsquo;s grave and bronze statue.  Had the massive tree fallen in a slightly different direction, it would have smashed the gravestone and toppled Jefferson Davis from his pedestal.The final journeys of Lincoln and Davis, each a martyr to his cause, tell the stories of two men, two peoples, and two nations during the most thrilling days in American history.  Their dual stories form an American epic, a kind of AmericanIliad, that made our history, and that continues to influence it to this day.",

But Nichols needed more help than this PI could ever have imagined. \"She'd been drowning, and I'd been busy.\" The successful, middle-class young woman had been sinking into a sea of drugs, alcohol, and prostitution, hitting the bottom when she jumped from the Boston Custom House. Her death consumes Kenzie--he is convinced that someone pulled her into the vortex, although her nearest and dearest simply call her weak.Kenzie teams up with his explosive, loving, gun-toting friend Bubba Rogowski, and, after a boozy reunion, Angie Gennaro joins them. This fearless threesome must surely be the most original team in contemporary crime fiction. Good at the core--but seriously screwed up by various demons from their pasts--tact and decorum is hardly their style. They work their way across Boston, doing whatever it takes to question Nichols's family and acquaintances. By unveiling the real Nichols, tragic family secrets, betrayals, and conspiracies are also unmasked.If you haven't experienced Dennis Lehane's world before, be prepared for an invigorating new reading experience.--Naomi Gesinger--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",
        "0060820977": "Macomber (Between Friends; Navy Wife) covers familiar emotional ground in an unusual setting, giving readers a glimpse of life in a Minneapolis convent. In the early 1960s, three young women find themselves taking vows: Angelina Marcello, answering what she believes to be God's call; Kathleen O'Shaughnessy, who is following the urging of her devout parents; and Joanna Baird, who is fleeing heartbreak (her fiance arrived home from a tour in Vietnam with a pregnant Vietnamese bride a month before their planned wedding). They initially find fulfillment in service-Joanna as a nurse, Angelina as a home economics teacher, Kathleen as an elementary school teacher-but as the years pass, each confronts a crisis of faith that she cannot resolve within the convent walls. In the early 1970s, they return to secular life to face a society that has changed dramatically in the previous decade, particularly in relations between men and women. The premise is inventive, but the challenges the sisters face-a young student's back-alley abortion, an alcoholic priest, encounters with violent and lascivious men-are predictable, and Macomber gives them stock treatment. The development of the women's friendship occurs off the page, so that it seems jarring when they reminisce like soul mates at a reunion years later, with families in tow. Macomber's historical research about the Second Vatican Council and church politics is seamlessly woven into the story and adds badly needed depth to the novel.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",
        "0061001783": "Young Kitty Charing stands to inherit a vast fortune from her irascible great-uncle Matthew--provided she marries one of her cousins. Kitty is not wholly adverse to the plan,ifthe right nephew proposes. Unfortunately, Kitty has set her heart on Jack Westruther, a confirmed rake, who seems to have no inclination to marry her anytime soon. In an effort to make Jack jealous,andto see a little more of the world than her isolated life on her great-uncle's estate has afforded her, Kitty devises a plan. She convinces yet another of her cousins, the honorable Freddy Standen, to pretend to be engaged to her. Her plan would bring her to London on a visit to Freddy's family and (hopefully) render the elusive Mr. Westruther madly jealous. Thus beginsCotillion, arguably the funniest, most charming ofGeorgette Heyer's many delightful Regency romances.No sooner does Kitty arrive in London than she becomes embroiled in the romantic difficulties of several new acquaintances. Kitty's French cousin, Camille, a professional gambler, has won the heart of her new friend, Olivia--who also happens to be the object of Jack Westruther's dishonorable intentions. Meanwhile, Kitty's doltish cousin Lord Dolphinton has fallen in love with a merchant's daughter who's embattled with his mother and needs his help. Finally, there is Kitty herself, who begins to wonder if the dandified Freddy might not be the man for her after all. As in all of Georgette Heyer's books,Cotilliontranscends genre--it is, quite simply, wonderful literature. Historically accurate down to the finest details of dress, deportment, and speech, Heyer was also a master at creating unforgettable, comic characters, and Kitty Charing and Freddy Standen stand out as one of her most charming romantic duos ever.",

Developed by Ensemble Studios,Halo Warsfor Xbox 360&nbsp;brings all the drama of a real-time strategy game to the popular Halo Universe.

Featuring detailed environments and complicated new battle mechanisms, this game demands a different kind of perspective than the first-person shooters from the original Halo series. You'll need to uncover the hidden strengths and weaknesses of each unit and play them to your tactical advantage, and that's just the beginning.UNSC: Be Part of a Legendary ConflictThe story opens with UNSC forces retaking the planet Harvest from the Covenant. At your disposal -- should you choose to take command of UNSC forces -- will be everything from a corps of highly-trained Marines to the Warthogs, Scorpions, and Hornets you'll need for air and land attacks. You'll take stock of the map and decide between holding your ground or advancing on enemy strongholds, all while trying to navigate the local terrain and outsmart Covenant forces. And when you need something extra to tip the tide in your favor, UNSC leaders can provide you with the ability to mobilize highly specialized units or call the Spirit of Fire vessel for support from above.Covenant: A Capable, Playable Enemy FactionThat's right, Covenant is playable in this corner of the Halo universe. This alliance of alien species has manipulated advanced technology, firepower, and tactical prowess into a powerful force that is engaged in a Genocidal war against human race, having branded humans as heretics. With the ability to play as these tough, alien fighters, you'll have advanced shield technology, the modular Citadel at the heart of Covenant's colonizing power, and, of course, the iconic Scarab attack vehicle at your disposal, adding a whole new dimension to your strategic warfare. The Scarab is a terrifying military vehicle crafted from heavy mining equipment. And with a mining laser that delivers massive damage across battlefields large and small, turrets for taking on air attacks, and the ability to clamber over any terrain, what's not to love about commanding Scarabs instead of fighting against them?Developed Exclusively for Xbox 360Most console RTS games are adapted from existing PC games, which can make their controls bulky or awkward, butHalo Warshas been developed for Xbox 360 from the ground up. This means the controls are sensitive, intuitive, and easy-to-operate in the midst of battle. And the UI is just as intuitive, so whether you're managing a unit of marines or a deadly machine, you can focus on creating a battle strategy instead of worrying about how to overcome a clumsy controller.No matter which faction you choose to play as, you can test your skills against those of other players in online skirmishes that allow up to six players with the New Xbox Experience through Xbox LIVE.",

Although George has already lived in the camp long enough to father an illegitimate child, Serena is new to the mountains--but she soon shows herself to be the equal of any man, overseeing crews, hunting rattle-snakes, even saving her husband's life in the wilderness. Together this lord and lady of the woodlands ruthlessly kill or vanquish all who fall out of favor. Yet when Serena learns that she will never bear a child, she sets out to murder the son George fathered without her. Mother and child begin a struggle for their lives, and when Serena suspects George is protecting his illegitimate family, the Pembertons' intense, passionate marriage starts to unravel as the story moves toward its shocking reckoning.Rash's masterful balance of violence and beauty yields a riveting novel that, at its core, tells of love both honored and betrayed.The Gift of Silence: An Essay by Ron RashWhen readers ask how I came to be a writer, I usually mention several influences: my parents&#x2019; teaching by example the importance of reading; a grandfather who, though illiterate, was a wonderful storyteller; and, as I grew older, an awareness that my region had produced an inordinate number of excellent writers and that I might find a place in that tradition.  Nevertheless, I believe what most made me a writer was my early difficulty with language.My mother tells me that certain words were impossible for me to pronounce, especially those with j&#x2019;s and g&#x2019;s.  Those hard consonants were like tripwires in my mouth, causing me to stumble over words such as &#x201C;jungle&#x201D; and &#x201C;generous.&#x201D;  My parents hoped I would grow out of this problem, but by the time I was five, I&#x2019;d made no improvement.  There was no speech therapist in the county, but one did drive in from the closest city once a week.That once a week was a Saturday morning at the local high school.  For an hour the therapist worked with me.  I don&#x2019;t remember much of what we did in those sessions, except that several times she held my hands to her face as she pronounced a word.  I do remember how large and empty the classroom seemed with just the two of us in it, and how small I felt sitting in a desk made for teenagers.I improved, enough so that by summer&#x2019;s end the therapist said I needed no further sessions.  I still had trouble with certain words (one that bedevils me even today is &#x201C;gesture&#x201D;), but not enough that when I entered first grade my classmates and teacher appeared to notice.  Nevertheless, certain habits of silence had taken hold.  It was not just self-consciousness.  Even before my sessions with the speech therapist, I had convinced myself that if I listened attentively enough to others my own tongue would be able to mimic their words.  So I listened more than I spoke.  I became comfortable with silence, and, not surprisingly, spent a lot of time alone wandering nearby woods and creeks.  I entertained myself with stories I made up, transporting myself into different places, different selves.  I was in training to be a writer, though of course at that time I had yet to write more than my name.Yet my most vivid memory of that summer is not the Saturday morning sessions at the high school but one night at my grandmother&#x2019;s farmhouse. After dinner, my parents, grandmother and several other older relatives gathered on the front porch.  I sat on the steps as the night slowly enveloped us, listening intently as their tongues set free words I could not master.  Then it appeared. A bright-green moth big as an adult&#x2019;s hand fluttered over my head and onto the porch, drawn by the light filtering through the screen door.  The grown-ups quit talking as it brushed against the screen, circled overhead, and disappeared back into the night.  It was a luna moth, I learned later, but in my mind that night it became indelibly connected to the way I viewed language--something magical that I grasped at but that was just out of reach.In first grade, I began learning that loops and lines made from lead and ink could be as communicative as sound. Now, almost five decades later, language, spoken or written, is no longer out of reach, but it remains just as magical as that bright-green moth.  What writer would wish it otherwise.",
        "0062011847": "Author One-to-One: Neil Gaiman Interviews Terry PratchettNeil Gaiman&rsquo;s best-selling novels includeNeverwhere,American Gods,Coraline,Anansi Boys, andGood Omens(with Terry Pratchett). He is the creator of the Sandman series of graphic novels and author of the short-fiction collectionsSmoke and Mirrors and Fragile Things.Neil Gaiman:Where did the idea forSnufforiginate?Terry Pratchett:I haven&rsquo;t a clue, but I think I started out by considering the character of Sir Samuel Vimes, as he now is, and since I find his inner monologue interesting I decided to use the old and well-tried plot device of sending a policeman on holiday somewhere he can relax, because we all know the way this one is supposed to go. And then I realised that moving Vimes out of his city element and away from his comfort zone was going to be a sheer treat to write.Gaiman:The Watch fascinate me. You get to do hardboiled police procedurals while still writing funny smart books set in a fantastic world.Pratchett:On a point of order, Mister Gaiman, the world in which Sam Vimes finds himself is hardly fantastic. Okay, there are goblins, but the overall ambience is that of the shires of Middle England. It&rsquo;s all about the commonality of humankind. Shove Sam Vimes into a situation that has gone toxic and away he goes, as realistic as any other policeman and thinking in the very same ways and being Sam Vimes, questioning his motives and procedures all the way through.Gaiman:Did you really say in a previous interview that you&rsquo;d like to be like Sam Vines? Why?Pratchett:I don&rsquo;t think I actually said that, but you know how it is and &lsquo;how it is&rsquo; changes as you get older. The author can always delve into his own personality and find aspects of himself with which he can dress his characters. If you pushed me I would say that ever since I stood up and talked about my Alzheimer&rsquo;s I have been a public figure; I visited Downing Street twice, wrote angry letters to theTimes, got into debates in the House of Commons, and generally became a geezer to the extent that I sit here sometimes bewildered and think to myself, &ldquo;Actually, your job is to sit here writing another book.  Changing the world is forotherpeople...&rdquo; and then I come back to myself with, &ldquo;No it isn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; And so, bearing in mind that these days, people call a kid from the council houses &ldquo;Sir&rdquo; allows me to create a mindset for Vimes.Gaiman:On a piece about writing in theNew York Times, Carl Hiaasen (a writer you started me reading on theGood Omenstour), wrote, &ldquo;Every writer scrounges for inspiration in different places, and there's no shame in raiding the headlines. It's necessary, in fact, when attempting contemporary satire. Sharp-edged humor relies on topical reference points... Unfortunately for novelists, real life is getting way too funny and far-fetched.&rdquo;  Does the Discworld as a setting allow you to escape from that? Or is it a tool that lets you raid the headlines in ways people might not expect?Pratchett:I think that&rsquo;s the commonality of humankind again. I hope that everyone in Discworld is a recognisable and understandable character and so sometimes I can present them with modern and contemporary problems, such as Mustrum Ridcully getting his head around homosexuality.In truth, I never have to go looking for this stuff; I turn to find it smacking me in the face. I was very pleased whenMaking Moneycame out just before the banking crisis and everyone said I had predicted it. It was hardly difficult.Gaiman:How has the Discworld changed over the years?Pratchett:I suppose the simple answer is that there is still humour, but the gags are no longer set up; they are derived from characters&rsquo; personalities and situations. These days the humour seems to arrive of its own accord.Gaiman:How has writing the Discworld novels changed how you see the world?Pratchett:I think it more true that getting older changes how you see the world. There is stuff inSnuff, for example, that I couldn&rsquo;t have written at 25. Although I had written things before Discworld, I really leaned writing, on the job as it were, on Discworld. I think that the books are, if not serious, dealing with more serious subjects. These days it&rsquo;s not just for laughs. My world view had changed; sometimes I feel that the world is made up of sensible people who know that plot and bloody idiots who don&rsquo;t. Of course, all Discworld fans know the plot by heart!Gaiman:How has writing the Discworld novels changed how the world sees you?Pratchett:Has it? My agent pointed out one day that I had been quoted by a columnist in some American newspaper, and he noted with some glee that they simply identified me by name without reminding people who I was, apparently in the clear expectation that their readers would know who I am. I have quite a large number of honorary doctorates; I am a professor of English at Trinity College Dublin and a fellow of King&rsquo;s College London, on top of all the other stuff, including the knighthood. However, when it gets to the sub-editors I am always going to be that writer of wacky fantasy, though I have to say that dismissiveness is getting rarer and rarer.Gaiman:Are you respectable?Pratchett:Is this a trick question? If so, then I shall say yes. Generally speaking I try to obey the law, pay my taxes (of which there are an enormous lot), give to charity, and write letters to theTimesthat they print.It&rsquo;s a weird term, respectable; isn&rsquo;t &lsquo;respek&rsquo; what every street kid wants and might possibly expect at the point of a knife? I certainly get involved with things and shortly after finishing this interview will be annoying my local MP. It&rsquo;s fun. Discworld and the Alzheimer&rsquo;s together have given me a platform.",

Through close readings of every section of the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament, he discovers that the Bible offers numerous answers that are often contradictory. The prophets think God sends pain and suffering as a punishment for sin and also that human beings who oppress others create such misery; the writers who tell the Jesus story and the Joseph stories think God works through suffering to achieve redemptive purposes; the writers of Job view pain as God's test; and the writers of Job and Ecclesiastes conclude that we simply cannot know why we suffer. In the end, frustrated that the Bible offers such a range of opposing answers, Ehrman gives up on his Christian faith and fashions a peculiarly utilitarian solution to suffering and evil in the world: first, make this life as pleasing to ourselves as we can and then make it pleasing to others. Although Ehrman's readings of the biblical texts are instructive, he fails to convince readers that these are indeed God's problems, and he fails to advance the conversation any further than it's already come.(Mar.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

One manuscript, The Crosswicks Horror, was left unfinished, and Oates has now resurrected it as a lush, arch, and blistering fusion of historical fact, supernatural mystery, and devilish social commentary. High-strung and ambitious Woodrow Wilson is the president of Princeton. Anxious over festering conflicts and appalled by what he learns about his distant relative and prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; after the nearby lynching of an African American man and his pregnant sister, Wilson seeks advice from retired Reverend Winslow Slade, who would rather think about the upcoming wedding of his granddaughter, Annabel. But this fair maiden is in danger of falling under the spell of a handsome stranger with otherworldly eyes. As an elite WASP enclave finds itself caught in the grip of inexplicable terror, readers will be bewitched by a fantastically dramatic, supremely imaginative plot rife with ghosts, vampires, demons, and human folly. Oates brings her nightshade humor and extraordinary fluency in eroticism and violence, American history and literature (her magnetizing characters include Mark Twain, Jack London, and Upton Sinclair) to this piercing novel of the devastating toll of repression and prejudice, sexism and class warfare.

SubtitledTwilight Princess, the game looks radically different fromThe Wind Wakerwith less stylized, more realistic looking graphics.As ever with a Nintendo title, much of the game is still surrounded in secrecy, but previews have already shown the game's enormous scale with huge areas of rolling countryside for you to ride your horse and battle various evil enemies. Indeed, the game seems more action-focused than previous adventures, both on horseback and on foot.One major new feature revealed in the game is that Link is now able to transform into a wolf. This gives him a whole suite of new features including the ability to \"see\" smells and access areas impossible as a human (or elf).Despite the greater emphasis on action, the puzzles in the game are even more elaborate than before. A forest dungeon reveals your ability to communicate with animals. You order around a troupe of baboons to solve puzzles and to help battle the level boss.The GameCube could hardly have asked for any better swansong than this, with utterly amazing graphics and an apparently endless range of features and settings. Even with so little still known about it, this is still on course to be the best game of the year.-- Harrison Dent, Amazon.co.ukThis preview is based on an incomplete version of the game; features or problems mentioned above may not appear in the finished game.",

Along the Atlantic coastline, a monster &#151; somehow familiar, yet still quite different from anything ever seen &#151; has been snatching little girls and bringing them back to the undersea city. It is a Big Sister, new denizens of Rapture who were once one of the forgotten little girls known as Little Sisters, known to inhabit the city's dank halls. No longer a pawn used to harvest ADAM, the dangerously powerful gene-altering lifeblood of Rapture, from the bodies of others and in turn run the risk of being harvested herself, the Big Sister is now the fastest and most powerful thing in Rapture. You, on the other hand are the very first Big Daddy, in fact the prototype, that for some reason has reactivated. You are similar to the Big Daddies familiar from the originalBioShock, but also very different in that you possess free will and no memory of the events of the past ten years. The question is, as you travel through the decrepit and beautiful fallen city beneath the waves, hunting for answers and the solution to your own survival, are you really the hunter, or the hunted?Gameplay and MultiplayerInBioShock 2players will take on the role of the original Big Daddy, not that of game one protagonist, Jack. As a Big Daddy you will have access to all the strengths and weapons of a standard Big Daddy, including the drill and rivet gun. More importantly you also possess free will and the ability to use plasmids and gene tonics &#151; genetic modifications allowed for through ADAM, a stem cell harvested from conquered enemies, or sea slugs outside the Rapture air lock, and powered by the in-game injectable serum known as EVE, which can be found, captured or purchased. Plasmids and gene tonics provide a wide range of aggressive and passive abilities which can be upgraded and arranged for quick use. The ability to use plasmids and tonics gives you a decided edge over other Big Daddies and most other denizens of Rapture, excluding the powerful Big Sisters. In addition, due to their role as a Big Daddy, players will experience a new relation to the Little Sisters. Upon defeating standard Big Daddys you are given the familiar choice as to whether to harvest or adopt them. Harvesting gains you ADAM immediately, but could alter your path through the game, while adopting makes you responsible for Little Sisters, who then accompany you through Rapture, but also provide aid and warning in times of danger. Additional gameplay features include: new plasmids, weapons and the ability to combine these two.The game also features the anticipated multiplayer modes. Several of these are team-based, allowing up to 10 players. Within these players are provided with a rich prequel experience that expands the origins of theBioShockfiction, and allows you to play as one of several characters pulled from Rapture's history before the events of the first game.Key FeaturesThe Big Sister- No longer just something to be harvested or not, the Big Sister is the most powerful resident in Rapture.You Are the Big Daddy- Take control with the original prototype Big Daddy, and experience the power and raw strength of Rapture&rsquo;s most feared denizens as you battle powerful new enemies.New Plasmids- New plasmids such as \"Aero Dash\" allowing for bursts of speed over short distances, and \"Geyser Trap\" a stream of water used as a jump pad and electrical conductor, join the ample list of Plasmids from the original game.New Game Mechanics-BioShock 2contains many new gameplay mechanics. Just a few of these are: the ability to wield plasmids and weapons simultaneously; flashback missions detailing how you became the Big Daddy; the ability to walk outside the airlocks of Rapture to discover new play areas, and many more.New Locations- Just a few of the locations and environments debuting inBioShock 2are Fontaine Futuristics, headquarters of Fontaine's business empire and the Kashmir Restaurant.Evolution of the Genetically Enhanced Shooter- Innovative advances bring new depth and dimension to each encounter, allowing players to create exciting combinations to fit their style of gameplay.Return to Rapture- Set approximately 10 years after the events of the original BioShock, the story continues with an epic, more intense journey through one of the most captivating and terrifying fictional worlds ever created.Genetically Enhanced Multiplayer- Earn experience points during gameplay to earn access to new weapons, plasmids and tonics that can be used to create hundreds of different combinations.Experience Rapture&rsquo;s Civil War- Players will step into the shoes of Rapture's citizens and take direct part in the civil war that tore Rapture apart.See Rapture Before the Fall- Experience Rapture before it was reclaimed by the ocean and engage in combat over iconic environments in locations such as Kashmir Restaurant and Mercury Suites, all of which have been reworked from the ground up for multiplayer.",

The Queen of Attolia sits calmly and watches the dreadful amputation behind her carefully cultivated mask of coldness, but later agonizes over what she has done to him. At the same time, she rages at herself for not hanging her captured prisoner outright.Readers who first met Eugenides as the rascally teenager Gen in the Newbery Honor-winningThe Thiefwill find that in this sequel he deepens through suffering and loss, but keeps the same witty talent for elaborate, crafty schemes of espionage and theft. Caught between two rival queens in a landscape based on that which surrounds the Mediterranean Sea, Eugenides is loyal to Eddis as her Queen's Thief, but in love (despite himself) with the beautiful and seemingly ruthless Attolia. In her small mountain country, Eddis controls the only bridge between the valley nation of Sounis and the coastal kingdom of Attolia, while all three are threatened by the ships of the powerful Medes. As the web of intrigue and shifting allegiances expands, and war is imminent, the Queen's Thief risks everything on an audacious and cunning military strategy to bring the two queens together--and to steal Attolia for himself. This remarkable fantasy, with its appealing characters, emotional intensity, witty dialogue, and inventive plot, will have teen fans panting for more.

        "0060567104": "Medical examiner Sara Linton and police chief Jeffrey Tolliver make their fourth appearance in this riveting new back-and-forth thriller that grounds a brutal attack by two young men on the Grant County, Georgia police department in a twelve-year-old Alabama murder case that occurred while Sara and Jeffrey were just beginning their tumultuous romance. En route to a beach vacation shortly after they meet, the couple takes a detour to the small town where Jeffrey grew up and began his law enforcement career. But their carefree holiday is interrupted when his best friend from childhood, a fellow cop, is charged with murder after killing a man who broke into his house. Despite his subsequent confession, Jeffrey believes there&#x92;s more to the story than Robert is telling him, and when the skeleton of a young woman with whom both Robert and Tolliver were once involved is discovered in a secret cave only they knew about, and Robert admits to her murder too, Tolliver must again confront a past he thought he had long since put behind him.Slaughter unravels a convoluted story deftly and smoothly as the action moves between those long-ago events and the siege of the police station by two young men who are determined to make Jeffrey pay for a crime they believe he committed. Threatening to kill whoever stands between them and their target--including eight children on a school field trip at the station house when the bloody siege begins--they execute a deputy they mistakenly believe is Tolliver. Skillfully blending past and present events and illuminating the equally convoluted relationship between Sara and Jeffrey (who have married and divorced in the intervening years) without interrupting the breathtaking pace of the action or dropping a beat, Slaughter takes this series to a new level of excellence.--Jane Adams",

Although the forces of Invierne were successfully driven back, the outer perimeter of the city still burns. Elisa is now queen of Joya d'Arena, and the crown is proving to be a heavy burden in more ways than one. The Inviernos still seek to capture her to manipulate the power of the Godstone she bears. There is massive civil unrest, and there are those at court who seek to undermine her rule. Although her husband has only been dead a few months, she is being pressured to remarry to secure an alliance with one of the noble houses in the kingdom. After several attempts are made on her life, she sets off on a perilous quest that is part of the fulfillment of her destiny as the bearer. As in the first book, Elisa's narration conveys a sense of immediacy.

        "006039384X": "Maguire has a lock on clever, elaborate retellings of fairy tales, turning them inside out and couching them in tongue-in-cheek baroque prose. After his revisionist takes on Oz's Wicked Witch of the West (Wicked) and Cinderella's ugly stepsisters (Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister), he now tackles Snow White. The notorious Borgia habit of poisoning rivals inspired him to transplant the classic tale to 16th-century Tuscany, where Vicente de Nevada is an expatriate Spanish widower who lives with his daughter, the fair Bianca. Beholden to sinister Cesare Borgia and Cesare's sister (and perhaps lover) Lucrezia, Vicente is sent on what appears to be a fool's errand, to discover and steal from a Middle East monastery a branch of the Tree of Knowledge complete with three apples. When Bianca is 11, Cesare's attraction to her causes the envious Lucrezia to order a young hunter to murder her and deliver her heart in a casket. Bianca, of course, is spared and taken in by seven dwarfs. But this is not Disney; the dwarfs are boulders, stirred to life by Bianca's arrival (\"a clothed, bearded obstinacy became slowly apparent\"). Several years pass in surreal, dreamlike fashion, with Bianca tending to the dwarfs, who cavort stiffly and philosophize collectively. When Vicente returns successful, Lucrezia poisons an apple for her rival. Innocent Bianca's fate is gentle, but that of the corrupt Lucrezia, in brilliant Venice, is appropriately grotesque. Fairy tales in their original form are often brutal and disturbing; with his rich, idiosyncratic storytelling, Maguire restores the edge to an oft-told tale and imbues it with a strange, unsettling beauty.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.",

If those two facts don't raise at least an eyebrow of  your interest, then there's probably not much in the world of video games that  will. Thankfully, the jaw-dropping graphics are matched up to a very playable  shoot-'em-up concept that works as a slightly more in-depth version of the PS2'sStar Wars Starfighter,  except without any of thatEpisode Inonsense. Rather, it re-creates  everything from the Death Star trench run to the Battle of Hoth.The game is actually a sequel toRogue Squadronfor the N64--an excellent  game that many only remember from the rather lackluster PC version. It's  structurally very similar to the original, with a dozen or so levels and a Star  Destroyer full of secret levels and ships. The game does feature a few new  ideas, such as controllable wingmen and ground troops, and some of the levels  are set in deep space rather than planetside, but at its heart this is stillRogue Squadrondeluxe.What elevates the game to an object of worship is the graphics--they really do  look almost identical to the movie's, with several scenes appearing like exact  copies.

A long time coming,TF2was first announced in 1998, but in the years that followed went through various concept and design changes, which left it looking less and less like the beloved original release. Luckily by the time the final version came off the presses and was bundled as part of EA?s 2007 release,The Orange Box, it had returned to something very close to the original game.The return of a classicMeet the full team.View larger.Heavy dropping a few shells.View larger.Pyro bringing the heat.View larger.Scout catching some air.View larger.GameplayBuilt around multiplayer battles of two teams, Reliable Excavation Demolition (RED) and Builders League United (BLU), representing competing construction teams, players choose between two game modes: capture the flag (CTF) and a control point mode. In CTF the objective is to obtain a briefcase of intelligence from the enemy team's base and return it to their own base while preventing the opposing team from doing the same. In the control point mode the objective is similar, only related to holding particular territories. To be successful in either the most important thing is to understand and use each character class in the best way possible.A Game That's a Class OperationUnlike other \"class-based\" games that offer a variety of combat classes only,Team Fortress 2features a wide variety of classes which provide a broad range of tactical abilities and personalities, and lend themselves to a variety of player skills. All nine playable character classes from the original game are available and although a few of these, like the Medic and Heavy generally work well with any mix of characters, overall each have particular strengths in offensive, defensive and support capacities. Each also will respond dynamically with different comical dialogue when in combat.The full character classes include:Pyro- An offensive class with average damage tolerance, Pyros are armed with a flamethrower, shotgun and a fire axe.Engineer- A defensive class with a low threshold for damage, Engineers can upgrade weapons and equipment and are armed with a shotgun, a pistol and a wrench.Spy- Used for sabotage the Spy carries a revolver, a butterfly knife, an electronic zapper and a diguise kit.Heavy- Tough on offense and defense the Heavy's weapons are the minigun, the shotgun and his fists.Sniper- A support class with low damage tolerance, the Sniper is armed with a sniper rifle, a submachine gun and a machete.Scout- The Scout is fast but susceptible to damage. His weapons are a sawed off shotgun, a pistol and a baseball bat.Soldier- A slow, but a powerful offensive class, the soldier wields a rocket launcher, a shotgun and a spade.Demoman- A defense class with an average amount of protection, the Demoman is armed with a remotely detonated sticky bomb and a bottle of Scotch.Medic- Medics keep other characters alive and are armed with a healing 'medigun,' a syringe-firing launcher and a bone saw.The importance of the abilities of particular classes aside, far and away the dominant factor inTeam Fortress 2and the secret to its popularity, is its clear dedication to fun. This is seen in its rejection of realism in favor of cartoon-style art in the game's graphics, the inclusion of super weapons like lasers and missile launchers hidden within the six standard maps and the attention given to each character's incidental trash talking functionality. Combined, these simply make for fast-paced, over-the-top fun which are the building blocks of any multiplayer shooter.System Requirements:Minimum Specifications:Recommended Specifications:OS:Windows Vista/XP/2000Processor:1.7 Ghz ProcessorPentium 4 Processor (3.0 Ghz or better)RAM:512 MB RAM1 GB RAMVideo Card:DirectX 8 level Graphics cardDirectX 9 level Graphics cardOther:DVD-ROM Drive/Mouse/Keyboard/Internet Connection&nbsp;",

Travel caravan leader Oatsie Manglehand stumbles upon the body of an unknown young man, badly beaten but still alive. She presents him to the wise Superior Maunt, who recognizes the hurt boy as Liir, rumored to be the dead Witch's secreted son.

Along the way, a headspinning cast of vividly described, eccentric characters emerges, but nothing prepares Liir for Candle's shocking surprise announcement.

But a storm is brewing on Henry Island. The wind is howling, the rain is pouring, and the local ferry won't be back until morning. Then people start dying.

In the end, it is up to Meg to save herself and figure out who is killing her friends and why. Though character development and motivation are a bit weak, McNeil's novel nicely parallels Agatha Christie's classic And Then There Were None (originally titled Ten Little Indians in the United States), and is likewise a quick-paced thriller full of half-facts and red herrings that take readers through the twists and turns of a deadly weekend. While it might not be considered an amazing teen mystery, among the numerous adaptations and stories that borrow from Christie's 1939 novel, McNeil's book holds its own.-Jennifer Miskec, Longwood University, Farmville, VA&#x3B1;(c) Copyright 2011.

All that remains is the search for the truth behind his betrayal and the survival of its consequences.The StoryDeceived by the forces of evil into prematurely bringing about the end of the world, War - the first Horseman of the Apocalypse - stands accused of breaking the sacred law by inciting a war between heaven and hell. Dishonored and stripped of his powers, War must return to Earth to search for the truth and punish those responsible. But there is no clear definition of good and evil in this tale. Hunted by a vengeful group of angels, War must take on the forces of Hell, forge uneasy alliances with the very demons he hunts, and journey across the ravaged remains of the Earth on his quest for vindication. But the answers he seeks will reveal a deep conspiracy in which War will find, and have to resign himself to the reality that although once the hand of God, he is just a pawn in the eternal battle between heaven and hell.GameplayA mix of exploration and fast-paced action gameplay,Darksidersis based on nonlinear play situations. That means that as War slowly regains his previous powers of destruction and carnage in order to continue his search for the origins and reasons for his betrayal, players will be able to backtrack to areas and scenarios that they may have left unexplored upon first discovery. Almost all areas of the game can be explored and some of the things players will find as they do so are treasure chests, health chests, and bonus life points, etc. The ability to go back and explore areas is important, especially as the game progresses and War finds himself up against enemies whose defeat require special skills and/or weaponry.As for combat gameplay,Darksidersfeatures a variety of weapons--including blades and firearms--that can be used in combo moves or in single strikes. Some of these can be charged up for quick, but devastating attacks on enemies and all can be arranged on your controller's D-pad for easy and preferred access. Additional gameplay elements include the ability/necessity to fight from the back of your mount, Ruin, and the collection of the souls in the form of glowing orbs that fall to the ground as enemies are dispatched. The latter can be used to level up War with new items and abilities.Varied Characters and EnvironmentsAlthough players take on the imposing role or War,Darksidersalso contains a wide variety of equally intriguing and sometimes frightening characters. These include: an assortment of vengeful angels; demons, such as \"the Jailer\" whose body is made up of the remains of countless cadavers; a bestiary of wicked and vile creatures created to bolster the armies of hell on Earth; and Ruin, the trusty steed of War. Gameplay environments players will experience are equally varied, and include areas both underground and on the surface, that call to mind both familiar, if ruined modern urban environments, as well as ones seemingly pulled from the nightmarish scenes of the biblical apocalypse.Key FeaturesApocalyptic Power of War- Unleash the wrath of War, combining brutal attacks and supernatural abilities to decimate all who stand in your way.Extreme Arsenal- Wield a devastating arsenal of angelic, demonic, and Earthly weapons, and blaze a trail of destruction atop Ruin, War's fiery phantom steed.Epic Quest- Battle across the wastelands and demon-infested dungeons of the decimated Earth in your quest for vengeance and redemption.Character Progression- Uncover powerful ancient relics, upgrade your weapons, unlock new abilities, and customize your gameplay style.Battle Heaven and Hell- Battle against all who stand in your way&mdash;from war-weary angelic forces to hell's hideous demon hordes.Weapons and Gear-Darksidersfeatures an extensive arsenal and inventory of weapons and gear.Varied Play Environments- Players will fight through varied environments, including those above and underground, and modern and nightmarishly mythical in design.PlayStation Network- Although a single player game,Darksidersfeatures PlayStation Network Trophy support and other features to heighten the gameplay experience.",

Patrick Kenzie knows he did the right thing twelve years ago (during the events inGone, Baby, Gone) when he located missing 4-year-old Amanda McCready and returned her to her neglectful mother, even though she would&#x2019;ve been better off with her kidnappers.  That doesn&#x2019;t mean he&#x2019;s had an easy time living with his decision.

        "0060504072": "Readers familiar with Barbara Kingsolver will find thatSmall Wonder, a collection of 23 essays, shows the same sensitivity and thoughtfulness, the same rich knowledge of and love for the natural world, as her spellbinding novels. In \"Knowing Our Place,\" she describes the two places in which she writes: a tin-roof cabin in Appalachia and her home in the Tucson desert. In \"Setting Free the Crabs,\" she uses her daughter's decision not to take home a beautiful (and occupied) red conch shell from a Mexican beach to illustrate our own need to give up our sense of ownership of the earth, to resist \"the hunger to possess all things bright and beautiful.\" Many of these pieces, like the lovely title essay, were written (or rewritten) in response to the events of September 11, which threw into relief the growing social and economic inequities that are so little remarked on in the American media. These are political essays, although Kingsolver is not a natural rhetorician; her prose is too supple and inclusive.  She is more inclined to follow the turns of her mind, like water in a curving stream bed, than to hammer home a point or two. But she has a rare gift for apt allusion (from sources as wide-ranging as Robert Frost to Beanie Babies) and for the elegant use of facts and figures. And she is highly quotable.

        "B001BNFQKO": "What does the American Dream mean today?For Niko Bellic, fresh off the boat from Europe, it is the hope he can escape his past. For his cousin, Roman, it is the vision that together they can find fortune in Liberty City, gateway to the land of opportunity. As they slip into debt and are dragged into a criminal underworld by a series of shysters, thieves and sociopaths, they discover that the reality is very different from the dream in a city that worships money and status, and is heaven for those who have them and a living nightmare for those who don&rsquo;t.Beginning with the 1997 release of the originalGrand Theft Auto, theGTAseries has been one of the most prolific, controversial and down right entertaining franchises in video games history. This pedigree of success guarantees that the highly anticipated eleventh game in the series,Grand Theft Auto IV, will garner at least as much attention if not more.Return to Liberty City.The dream as Niko expected it.View larger.There's always a catch.View larger.But some skills are international.View larger.The PlotGrand Theft Auto IVis a brand new adventure in theGTAuniverse following the experiences of Nikolai \"Niko\" Bellic, a new immigrant from an undisclosed eastern European country whose troubled pa st and the persuasion of his cousin Roman have brought him to the fictional Liberty City. Unfortunately, Niko&rsquo;s search for the American Dream and a much needed fresh start, hits an immediate snag when the rags to riches story Roman spun to pique Niko's interest is exposed as not only a complete fabrication, but a ploy to enlist Niko&rsquo;s well-known skills as a tough guy against the ample list of enemies clamoring for Roman&rsquo;s debt-ridden blood.Because Roman is the only person Niko knows in Liberty City he begrudgingly accepts his role as Roman&rsquo;s protector despite the deception. But as time goes on Niko comes into his own, and his experience on the wrong side of the tracks proves more valuable than he could have ever imagined as he fights for survival and later supremacy on the crime ridden streets of Liberty City.Game EnvironmentsBased on several of the boroughs of New York City and parts of New Jersey, Liberty City, familiar to players of previous games in the series, has been entirely redesigned forGTA IV. Players can expect visible detail down to the weeds growing in the cracks in the sidewalk, cars and buildings of visibly different ages and a much greater level if verticality in the buildings and bridges that they are able to explore as Niko moves through the city streets. In addition, pedestrians inGTA IVare much more realistic. No longer simply moving cardboard cutouts, these NPCs are intelligent, modern, human representations that laugh, cry, eat, drink, use cell phones and ATMs, and talking amongst themselves regardless of Niko&rsquo;s interaction with them.GameplayHistoricallyGTAgames have focused heavily on mission-based play, requiring successful completion of fixed tasks in order for players to progress through the game, but this has changed to a great extent inGTA IV. Players will experience an entirely new and exciting emphasis centered on the blending of on-mission and off-mission play, resulting not only in an increased sense of realism, but more interesting and unrestricted gameplay.FeaturesAside from the car jacking and a detailed city environment here are the new features forGTA IV:Improved combat system - Now you can use cover and also a target lock system, which allows you to take out targets with greater ease and accuracy. Plus, you can engage in some hand-to-hand combat if you can't get your hands on a piece quick enough.Cell phone - Not just for basic phone calls anymore. Use your in-game cell phone to receive missions via SMS, snap photos, and ZiT (tag) songs that can be downloaded exclusively on Amazon.com/mp3.Free time - In between missions you can take advantage of \"me\" time. There are gentleman's clubs, comedy clubs, bowling alleys, and bars, which all house unique activities.Take a break from the storyline - A variety of side missions allow you to help run a car service, \"borrow\" cop cars, assassinate targets, help solve problems for those on the street, or take to the air with stunt jumps that are scattered all over the city.Control your own fate - Throughout the game choice moments will arrive causing you to make a decision that will affect relationships and money.MultiplayerGive Niko a rest and create your own multiplayer \"hero.\"GTAhas added multiplayer modes allowing you to take your creation out to play online in competitive, co-op, and free form modes. Competitive mode has you fighting against the cops, jacking cars, or racing to finish odd jobs. Co-op challenges you and your friends with various tasks including Hangman's NOOSE where you are responsible for escorting a wanted kingpin to a safe extraction point. Freeform lets you and 15 others lose on Liberty City. Use this mode to hit up the bar and play virtual darts versus each other or head out to the streets and set up your own drag races.

Tolkien's definitive three-book epic, the Lord of the Rings (encompassingThe Fellowship of the Ring,The Two Towers, andThe Return of the King), and its charming precursor,The Hobbit. That many (if not most) fantasy works are in some way derivative of Tolkien is understood, but the influence of the Lord of the Rings is so universal that everybody from George Lucas to Led Zeppelin has appropriated it for one purpose or another.Not just revolutionary because it was groundbreaking, the Lord of the Rings is timeless because it's the product of a truly top-shelf mind. Tolkien was a distinguished linguist and Oxford scholar of dead languages, with strong ideas about the importance of myth and story and a deep appreciation of nature. His epic, 10 years in the making, recounts the Great War of the Ring and the closing of Middle-Earth's Third Age, a time when magic begins to fade from the world and men rise to dominance. Tolkien carefully details this transition with tremendous skill and love, creating in the Lord of the Rings a universal and all-embracing tale, a justly celebrated classic.--Paul Hughes--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

The Lace Reader retains the strange magic of a vivid dream, though Barry's portrayal of modern-day Salem, Massachusetts--with its fascinating cast of eccentrics--is reportedly spot-on. Some of its stranger residents include generations of Whitney women, with a gift for seeing the future in the lace they make. Towner Whitney, back to Salem from self-imposed exile on the West Coast, has plans for recuperation that evaporate with her great-aunt Eva's mysterious drowning. Fighting fear from a traumatic adolescence she can barely remember, Towner digs in for answers. But questions compound with the disappearance of a young woman under the thrall of a local fire-and-brimstone preacher, whose history of violence against Whitney women makes the situation personal for Towner. Her role in cop John Rafferty's investigation sparks a tentative romance. And as they scramble to avert disaster, the past that had slipped through the gaps in Towner's memory explodes into the present with a violence that capsizes her concept of truth.

        "0061340634": "SignatureReviewed byAndrew O'HaganNovelists can no longer take it as an insult when people say their novels are like good television, because the finest American television is better written than most novels. Ann Patchett's new one has the texture, the pace and the fairy tale elegance of a half dozen novels she might have read and loved growing up, but the magic and the finesse ofRunis really much closer to that ofSix Feet UnderorERorThe Sopranos, and that is good news for everybody, not least her readers.Bernadette and Bernard Doyle were a Boston couple who wanted to have a big lively family. They had one boy, Sullivan, and then adopted two black kids, Teddy and Tip. Mr. Doyle is a former mayor of Boston and he continues his interest in politics, hoping his boys will shape up one day for elected office, though none of them seems especially keen. Bernadette dies when the adopted kids are just four, and much of the book offers a placid requiem to her memory in particular and to the force of motherhood in lives generally. An old statue from Bernadette's side of the family seems to convey miracles, and there will be more than one before this gracious book is done. One night, during a heavy snowfall, Teddy and Tip accompany their father to a lecture given by Jessie Jackson at the Kennedy Centre. Tip is preoccupied with studying fish, so he feels more than a little coerced by his father. After the lecture they get into an argument and Tip walks backwards in the road. A car appears out of nowhere and so does a woman called Tennessee, who pushes Tip out of the car's path and is herself struck. Thus, a woman is taken to hospital and her daughter, Kenya, is left in the company of the Doyles. Relationships begin both to emerge and unravel, disclosing secrets, hopes, fears.Runis a novel with timeless concerns at its heart&mdash;class and belonging, parenthood and love&mdash;and if it wears that heart on its sleeve, then it does so with confidence. And so it should: the book is lovely to read and is satisfyingly bold in its attempt to say something patient and true about family. Patchett knows how to wear big human concerns very lightly, and that is a continuing bonus for those who found a great deal to admire in her previous work, especially the ultra-laudedBel Canto. Yet one should not mistake that lightness for anything cosmetic:Runis a book that sets out inventively to contend with the temper of our times, and by the end we feel we really know the Doyle family in all its intensity and with all its surprises.Andrew O'Hagan's novel Be Near Mehas just been published by Harcourt.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0060727535": "A humble, happy look back from the man in black. Johnny Cash answers to many names; he's JR to childhood friends and family, John to bandmates, and Johnny to fans. ``Cash'' is the name wife June Carter reserves for ``the star, the egomaniac.'' The star gets plenty of ink here, from the early days at Sun Records--with Elvis, Carl Perkins, and Jerry Lee Lewis--to his current status as a darling of the alternative rock set. But it's the private man who's most compelling and surprisingly complex. Cash writes candidly of his recurring addiction to amphetamines and his concomitant shortcomings as a father, addresses his spirituality without sounding maudlin, and displays genuine humility at his success and very little bitterness at his abandonment by the country music establishment. A more accurate subtitle might be ``The Second Autobiography,'' since this volume covers some of the same ground as Cash's previous work, The Man in Black (1986), but a life so chock full of oddments (he once started a forest fire with an automobile and on another occasion was nearly disemboweled by an ostrich) and renegade stands (he opposed Vietnam, heresy to the nation's blue- collar constituency) easily merits a second look. Organized around the domiciles where he divides his time--homes in Tennessee, Florida, and Jamaica, as well as his tour bus--the book stays grounded in the present, mixing reflections on his 40-year career with a running chronicle of an ongoing tour. This novel approach minimizes the as-told-to blahs that plague many a celebrity autobiography and highlights Cash's wry humor and introspection. With the help of Carr, editor of Country Music magazine, Cash keeps the pace lively until the end, when the roses he throws everyone from grandkids to music biz buddies bog things down. Mostly, though, a pungent, substantive autobiography from one the most iconoclastic talents on the American music scene.

        "0062000675": "*Starred Review* In 2009, Laura Ling, a reporter with Current TV, traveled with a film crew to the region of China that bordered on North Korea to report on defections, particularly of women who were later forced into arranged marriages or sex slavery. The crew momentarily crossed into North Korea, and Ling and Euna Lee, her editor and translator, were captured. Given the hostilities between North Korea and China and a recent critical documentary on North Korea by Laura&#x2019;s sister, journalist Lisa Ling, the women knew they were in for an ordeal. Laura was beaten during the capture, and the women were held in isolation and faced meager meals, cold, and little medical treatment. In the U.S., Lisa and her family prayed and called on powerful contacts, including Al Gore and Bill Richardson, to win the women&#x2019;s release. During the time of their captivity, North Korea conducted a nuclear test and fired off missiles, increasing tensions with the U.S. and UN. The women were eventually tried for attempting to overthrow the government and sentenced to 12 years in a labor camp, but through behind-the-scenes maneuvering and negotiations with prickly North Korea, they were finally released after five months in captivity. This memoir alternates between the sisters, with Laura recalling the escalating peril of her capture and imprisonment and Lisa recalling heightened worries as weeks dragged into months. A riveting story of captivity and the enduring faith, determination, and love of two sisters. --Vanessa Bush",

        "0060175966": "When the editors of theOxford English Dictionaryput out a call during the late 19th century pleading for &quot;men of letters&quot; to provide help with their mammoth undertaking, hundreds of responses came forth. Some helpers, like Dr. W.C. Minor, provided literally thousands of entries to the editors. But Minor, an American expatriate in England and a Civil War veteran, was actually a certified lunatic who turned in his dictionary entries from the Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum. Simon Winchester has produced a mesmerizing coda to the deeply troubled Minor's life, a life that in one sense began with the senseless murder of an innocent British brewery worker that the deluded Minor believed was an assassin sent by one of his numerous &quot;enemies.&quot;Winchester also paints a rich portrait of the OED's leading light, Professor James Murray, who spent more than 40 years of his life on a project he would not see completed in his lifetime. Winchester traces the origins of the drive to create a &quot;Big Dictionary&quot; down through Murray and far back into the past; the result is a fascinating compact history of the English language (albeit admittedly more interesting to linguistics enthusiasts than historians or true crime buffs). That Murray and Minor, whose lives took such wildly disparate turns yet were united in their fierce love of language, were able to view one another as peers and foster a warm friendship is just one of the delicately turned subplots of this compelling book.--Tjames Madison",
        "0020519001": "As a youth of 18, Ernest Hemingway was eager to fight in the Great War. Poor vision kept him out of the army, so he joined the ambulance corps instead and was sent to France. Then he transferred to Italy where he became the first American wounded in that country during World War I. Hemingway came out of the European battlefields with a medal for valor and a wealth of experience that he would, 10 years later, spin into literary gold withA Farewell to Arms. This is the story of Lieutenant Henry, an American, and Catherine Barkley, a British nurse. The two meet in Italy, and almost immediately Hemingway sets up the central tension of the novel: the tenuous nature of love in a time of war. During their first encounter, Catherine tells Henry about her fianc&eacute; of eight years who had been killed the year before in the Somme. Explaining why she hadn't married him, she says she was afraid marriage would be bad for him, then admits:I wanted to do something for him. You see, I didn't care about the other thing and he could have had it all. He could have had anything he wanted if I would have known. I would have married him or anything. I know all about it now. But then he wanted to go to war and I didn't know.The two begin an affair, with Henry quite convinced that he \"did not love Catherine Barkley nor had any idea of loving her. This was a game, like bridge, in which you said things instead of playing cards.\" Soon enough, however, the game turns serious for both of them and ultimately Henry ends up deserting to be with Catherine.Hemingway was not known for either unbridled optimism or happy endings, andA Farewell to Arms, like his other novels (For Whom the Bell Tolls,The Sun Also Rises, andTo Have and Have Not), offers neither. What itdoesprovide is an unblinking portrayal of men and women behaving with grace under pressure, both physical and psychological, and somehow finding the courage to go on in the face of certain loss.--Alix Wilber--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

Samantha is abandoned by her husband in the opening pages of this three-handkerchief special, and the resultant tremors keep her off-balance for most of the novel. There are practical problems aplenty, of course, including a shortage of money and an 11-year-old son to raise. But Sam's sense of emotional bereavement is far worse, despite the fact that her husband had been giving her the conjugal cold shoulder for years:I miss David so much, yes I do, I miss the presence of another person in my bed at night, even if he doesn't touch me; the reliability of someone else being there in the morning, even if they only shave and stare straight ahead into the mirror while you lean against the bathroom doorjamb with your cup of coffee, chatting hopefully.The loneliness in her \"as constant and as irrefutable\" as circulating blood, Sam begins to rebuild her life. She finds herself a job and takes in a couple of boarders to help meet her mortgage payments. (One of them, a depressed student named Lavender Blue, informs her that \"life was nothing but one major disappointment after the other\"--the sort of homily that Sam is understandably reluctant to hear these days.) She also starts dating, with disastrous results. Yet this comically kvetching heroine does manage to find love in the ruins, and by the timeOpen Housewinds down, it's hard not to believe that she's much better off. Throughout, Berg alternates her snappy and sappy registers like a real pro.

And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature.

As always, the most unlikely things crop up as the subjects of gags--Chekhov, grand opera, the Caine Mutiny--and as always there are remorselessly funny gags about the inevitability of story:They say that the fifth elephant came screaming and trumpeting through the atmosphere of the young world all those years ago and landed hard enough to split continents and raise mountains.No one actually saw it land, which raised the interesting philosophical question: when millions of tons of angry elephant come spinning through the sky, and there is no one to hear it, does it--philosophically speaking--make a noise?As for the dwarfs, whose legend it is, and who mine a lot deeper than other people, they say that there is a grain of truth in it.All this, the usual guest appearances, and Gaspode the Wonder Dog.--Roz Kaveney, Amazon.co.uk--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired.

His search for his wife  (and his cat) introduces him to a bizarre collection of characters, including two psychic sisters, a possibly unbalanced teenager, an old soldier who witnessed the massacres on the Chinese mainland at the beginning of the Second World War, and a very shady politician.Haruki Murakami is a master of subtly disturbing prose. Mundane events throb with menace, while the bizarre is accepted without comment. Meaning always seems to be just out of reach, for the reader as well as for the characters, yet one is drawn inexorably into a mystery that may have no solution.The Wind-Up Bird Chronicleis an extended meditation on themes that appear throughout Murakami's earlier work. The tropes of popular culture, movies, music, detective stories, combine to create a work that explores both the surface and the hidden depths of Japanese society at the end of the 20th century.If it were possible to isolate one theme inThe Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, that theme would be responsibility. The atrocities committed by the Japanese army in China keep rising to the surface like a repressed memory, and Toru Okada himself is compelled by events to take responsibility for his actions and struggle with his essentially passive nature. If Toru is supposed to be a Japanese Everyman, steeped as he is in Western popular culture and ignorant of the secret history of his own nation, this novel paints a bleak picture. Like the winding up of the titular bird, Murakami slowly twists the gossamer threads of his story into something of considerable weight.--Simon Leake--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

A modern-day Horatio Alger on steroids, this fast-paced thrill ride of heartbreak and redemption will both captivate and inspire.Writing with Four Hands by Logan and Noah MillerWhen shooting a movie, every faculty is humming at its highest frequency. You don't sleep. It's intoxicating.  You're operating on the edge of delirium and grandiose promises of immortality. You think that if you do everything  right the gift of the gods is attainable. And then it ends. And there you are each morning. Alone again.We were left with an emotional hangover after we finished directingTouching Home, a movie about us and  our father. Less than a year earlier our father had passed away in jail. On that day, we had made a vow to him that  we would make our movie--and we had just realized that commitment. We were supposed to be happy now. But we were  miserable. For the last 350 days all our thoughts had been on the mission, the team of people we were working with.  Now our thoughts were focused inward and it was a tough place to be.But the torment wasn&#x2019;t enough&#x2026;So we decided to dive into another long-shot mission: Write a book about our moviemaking hell-ride.Where would we find the time? After all, we were still making the movie&#x2014;post-production, editing. We searched  for days. And then found it in the sleeping patterns of our editor, Academy Award nominee, Robert Dalva.You see, Robert is a night man. Not a party man, just a guy that goes to bed late. We are morning men--we go to  bed early and rise early, like man before electricity. Robert showed up at our house each day at 11am, where we  were cutting picture downstairs. This gave us several hours to write each morning before he showed up.And we write with four hands, which sometimes takes twice as long.One man types while the other writes freehand. Then we blend it. We only have one computer so space and time are  limited. Logan is the typer and Noah is the handwriter. And it's never pretty. One bro furiously smashing plastic  squares, the other furiously carving ink onto paper. Later, the two are brought together in a clash of abusive  language, each brother claiming the other is bipolar, illegitimate, the bastard son of an entire city. That their  mother sang lullabies to one and terrible songs to the other. That his diaper was rarely changed and it ruined his  brain. That he has written absolute tripe. That it belongs in the trash heap of failed street poets. We yell and  scream. We throw chairs and hot cups of coffee. Punch holes in the sheetrock&#x2026; And somehow, before Robert arrived,  we had embedded words into the memory of our computer.Writing the book brought back the excitement, allowed us to relive the boom and noise, the chaos and  uncertainty. It unleashed the dopamine gush, washed the drug over the brain, gave us another goal.We started writing in mid-April 2007 and had an ugly draft by October. We cut through it with a chainsaw and by  February 2008 it was prettier and ready to product test. We gave the draft to a few trusted friends, one of them  being national bestselling author Tess Uriza Holthe. Tess and the crew liked the manuscript--and they are a very  tough bunch. Tess gave the manuscript to her agent. It was an unpleasant week, the mental sauna--the self-inflicted  victimization that all writers suffer when waiting to hear what an agent thinks of their work. It gives you the  stomach jungle; hot rivers, chimps, and hairy insects howling in your gut. Then Mary Ann called and said that she  really liked our manuscript and our temperature left the tropics. She gave us some notes, we went back into the  manuscript, smoothed out some things, and then it was ready to send to publishers.An editor at HarperCollins read our manuscript the morning it was sent out and then tossed it up the ladder to  his boss, who took it home that night. The following day HarperCollins made us an offer--and we took it. They were  extremely enthusiastic about our book and we were equally enthusiastic about being paid. It had taken us nearly ten  years of writing diligently, working one mindless job after another, to finally get a paycheck for mental work. It  was time to move on from Top Ramen. Of course, we&#x2019;ll revisit the noodle delicacy, but out of choice, rather than  necessity.So we signed the contract with HarperCollins and began working with an editor on turning the book into something  the entire world would appreciate--another delusion. And now we&#x2019;re done. For now.It was our intention to make a movie, not write a book. By accident, we did both.And now we're here. Wherever that is.

The Legend of Zelda&trade;: Skyward Sword shakes up the tried-and-true adventure game formula and marks a turning point for the franchise. The introduction of full motion controls to the series enabled by Wii MotionPlus&trade; technology enhances player movements while offering the most intuitive play control of any game in the series to date.&nbsp;FEATURES:The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword boasts the most realistic sword combat of any game to date, turning every encounter into a challenge of both brains and brawn. Wii MotionPlus technology accurately translates the angle of every sword slice, effectively putting Link's blade in the player's hand. Analyzing enemy attack and defense tendencies and counteracting with precise swings of the sword provide a satisfying experience that blends puzzle-solving with a new and distinctly unique combat system.&nbsp;Explore a massive, multilayered world that seamlessly blends soaring exploration in a sea of clouds with intense ground-based adventuring that blurs the line between the main world and traditional Zelda dungeons.

Exploration of the forests, volcanoes and deserts requires players to think on their feet as they solve puzzles, overcome obstacles and escape deadly traps. Once they find their way to each dungeon, they are confronted by even more puzzles guarded by fiendish enemies.&nbsp;The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword redefines the traditional Zelda framework and introduces an arsenal of items, upgrades and rewards unlike any game in the franchise to date. The adventure guides players into, out of and back to dungeons and areas they've already completed. Along the way, Link gathers a massive inventory of peculiar items and resources that can be used to upgrade many of his weapons and equipment.Every copy in the initial production of the game will come packaged with a special music CD featuring orchestral arrangements of select songs performed at The Legend of Zelda 25th Anniversary Symphony Concert.&nbsp;A Wii Remote Plus&trade; controller or Wii MotionPlus&trade; accessory is required to play The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword. There will also be a limited edition bundle version of the game available, with a Gold Wii Remote Plus&trade; controller included.&nbsp;",

InHeavy Raineach player discovers their own answer to this question as they experience a gripping psychological thriller filled with innumerable twists and turns, where choices and actions can and do result in dramatic consequences. Spanning four days of mystery and suspense, the hunt is on for a murderer known only as the Origami Killer - named after his macabre calling card of leaving behind folded paper shapes at crime scenes. Even more chilling is the fiend's well established pattern of killing his victims four days after abducting them. The public is gripped with fear as the police seem powerless to stop the carnage, and another potential victim &#151; Shaun Mars &#151; has gone missing. Now four characters, each following their own leads and with their own motives, must take part in a desperate attempt to prevent the killer from taking yet another life.",
        "0060012358": "For this outrageously cheeky tale, British writer Pratchett pairs a dynamite plot with memorable characters a group of intelligent rats sporting such monikers as Hamnpork, Big Savings and Darktan (they've been foraging in the University of Wizards' garbage dump and come up with \"the kind of name you gave yourself if you learned to read before you understood what all the words actually meant\"), plus a \"stupid-looking kid\" with a flute and a criminal kitty mastermind named Maurice. The motley con artists' pied piper scam is highly successful until the rats develop a conscience. Reluctantly, they agree to one final heist, but in the town of Bad Blintz things go horribly, hilariously wrong. First, they're twigged by Malicia Grim (granddaughter and grand-niece of the Sisters Grim), then they encounter a pair of conniving rat-catchers, a real pied piper and an evil something lurking in the town's cellars. They triumph, of course, and there's even a glimmer of redemption for the deliciously self-centered Maurice, who tackles the \"Grim Squeaker\" and bargains for the life of his rat comrade Dangerous Beans. In the end, while the others settle down, Maurice hits the road and is last seen approaching another \"stupid-looking kid\" with a money-making proposition. Could this mean more tales to come? Readers will eagerly hope so. Ages 12-up.Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",
        "B00000DMAX": "Mario Kart 64, one of the first games released for the Nintendo 64  platform, is an updated translation of the very popularSuper Mario Kartfor the  Super NES (SNES). And while the game clearly takes full advantage of the graphics  power and speed of the N64, a few components that made the original so compelling  have been left out of this release.Still, Nintendo's expertise at sucking players into the game world is strongly evident, andMario Kart 64offers enough challenges to keep players (especially casual  gamers) entertained. Placing a familiar Nintendo personality behind the wheel of a  sputtering kart powered by a 50, 100, or 150-cc engine, the game lets players race  computerized opponents or up to four other players on a variety of well-designed tracks.  Because karts lack the power and speed of race cars, drivers must focus on collecting  power-ups and nonlethal weapons rather than negotiating hairpin turns on two wheels.  Grabbing and using on-track items is the heart of the game's fun: a strategically-placed  banana peel sends the unlucky victim into a spin, nailing an opponent with a turtle shell  launches their vehicle skyward, and a rocket provides a quick boost to near-breakneck  speeds, if only for a moment.The multiplayer mode provides enormously chaotic fun for up to four players--flip it on  at a party and watch the guests congregate around the screen.--Eric TwelkerPros:Well-designed tracksSimple controlsStrong multiplayer appealCons:Computerized opponents sometimes pull off questionable feats",

        "006193836X": "Originally serialized in the New York Times Magazine, Lippman's Tess Monaghan novella turns the intrepid Baltimore PI's at-risk late-pregnancy bed rest into a compellingly edgy riff on Hitchcock's Rear Window. Lovingly tucked up on her winterized sun porch, Tess marshals her forces--doting artist boyfriend Crow, best friend Whitney Talbot, middle-aged assistant gumshoe Mrs. Blossom, and researcher Dorie Starnes--to probe the disappearance of a chic blonde green-raincoated dog walker she'd been watching from her comfy prison. Tess also takes in the missing woman's abandoned green-slickered Italian greyhound from hell, a miniature canine terrorist whose anti-housebreaking vendetta offers comic relief from Tess's threatened pre-eclampsia, her obsessive unraveling of a complex scam, and her last-trimester spats with Crow about their future. Though postpartum Tess turns alternately weepy and shrill, that condition won't last, and this entertaining romp leaves plenty of hints of detective-mother exploits to come.

        "0062281305": "*Starred Review* Gus Silva is just nine years old when his mother is killed by Gus&#x2019; abusive father, marking the boy forever and leaving him desolate with grief and inexpressible guilt. Only the assistance of classmate Hallie Costa, daughter of widower Dr. Nick, pulls Gus from depression. Years later, after star football player Gus has become known as &#x201C;Voodoo&#x201D; for his winning charm, he and Hallie finally yield to what seems a lifelong love, until an incident at a beach party after the senior prom leaves Hallie seriously injured and causes Gus to join the priesthood. But even Father Gus can&#x2019;t shake a reputation for violence, leading to his wrongful conviction for murdering Ava Cilento, an abused woman who sought Gus&#x2019; counsel to protect her young daughter, then accused him of assault when she ended their alleged affair. As this epic spans decades, the third-person narration yields to the first-person account of teenager Mila Cilento, Ava&#x2019;s daughter, who uncovers the truth of what happened years earlier. By the author of The Liar&#x2019;s Diary (2007), this beautifully wrought novel is a sometimes wrenching but ultimately uplifting story of murder and betrayal in the face of faith, family in its truest sense, and&#x2014;most of all&#x2014;love. --Michele Leber",
        "0060294698": "Cabot (The Princess Diaries) presents another teen-pleasing novel and another likable heroine in this story set in Washington, D.C. Feisty, red-haired Samantha, a self-described \"urban rebel\" who has dyed all of her clothes black, is a 15-year-old middle child, uncomfortably wedged between her popular, cheerleader older sister, Lucy, and her brainy 11-year-old sister, Rebecca. And she has a major crush on Jack, Lucy's nonconformistartist boyfriend, whom she feels is far better suited to her than to her rather vacuous sister. The entertainingly opinionated narrator's wry top-10 lists add considerably to the tale's charm and speedy pacing, among them, the \"top ten reasons why I can't stand my sister Lucy\" and the \"top ten signs that Jack loves me and not my sister Lucy and just hasn't realized it yet.\" Sam's life suddenly changes dramatically when, while standing on the sidewalk one afternoon, she foils an attempt to assassinate the President. She becomes a national hero overnight, is named teen ambassador to the United Nations and eventually lands the president's son as her beau. Despite these rather unlikely plot twists (in a comic coincidence, the president's son also happens to be a fellow student in her art class whom she finds attractive), Sam's spunky and intermittently affecting narrative, as well as the true-to-life voices of the supporting cast of characters, make this a convincing and diverting tale. As Sam learns important truths about herself, Cabot interjects a worthy message into her comedic caper. Ages 12-up.Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.",

        "0062077902": "Teenage drama meets Quantum Leap in this exciting debut about secrets and murder. Vee has an inexplicable ability; when falling into what appears to be a narcoleptic state, she is really &#x201C;sliding&#x201D; into the mind of someone else&#x2014;watching events through their eyes. The mere touch of an object can trigger an episode, and they seem to be getting more frequent and more intense. When she slides into the mind of a murderer who has killed a friend and made it look like a suicide, Vee tries to channel her ability to solve the crime without revealing how she knows the truth. The story is intriguing and provides just enough information for the reader to piece together the mystery alongside Vee. The characters are well developed, with the exception of the murderer, whose motive, while believable, is not executed well enough to lift the climax above melodrama. Still, the novel is difficult to put down. While Vee&#x2019;s questions about sliding remain unanswered, the knowledge that she can live with who she is may be the greatest truth uncovered.

Jealous of Neil, a mortal, because Alice loves him, Apollo schemes to bring about Alice's demise, but his sister Artemis won't let dead mortals lie. Needing a hero for a journey, she enlists the timid Neil to go into Hades and recover Alice (and save the world while he's at it). Phillips's tale is a delightful flight of fancy into the world of what would the Greek gods do that is adequately abridged, though listeners may want to hear the full extent of the characters' exploits. Tom Sellwood delivers in an English accent that works well with the setting. He ably projects the various gods' and goddesses' personas through their dialogue, so Apollo's arrogance is heard as well as Ares' more aggressive personality. Sellwood is at his best as Neil, the dry and mild-mannered engineer who gets caught up in the games of the gods.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In between, he recounts such wonders as an entire town struck  with insomnia, a woman who ascends to heaven while hanging laundry, and a suicide that defies the laws of physics:A trickle of blood came out under the door, crossed the living room,  went out into the street, continued on in a straight line across the uneven terraces, went down steps and climbed over curbs, passed along the  Street of the Turks, turned a corner to the right and another to the left,  made a right angle at the Buend&iacute;a house, went in under the closed door,  crossed through the parlor, hugging the walls so as not to stain the rugs, went  on to the other living room, made a wide curve to avoid the dining-room  table, went along the porch with the begonias, and passed without being seen  under Amaranta's chair as she gave an arithmetic lesson to Aureliano  Jos&eacute;, and went through the pantry and came out in the kitchen, where  &Uacute;rsula was getting ready to crack thirty-six eggs to make bread.\"Holy Mother of God!\" &Uacute;rsula shouted.The story follows 100 years in the life of Macondo, a village founded  by Jos&eacute; Arcadio Buend&iacute;a and occupied by descendants all  sporting variations on their progenitor's name: his sons, Jos&eacute; Arcadio and Aureliano,  and grandsons, Aureliano Jos&eacute;, Aureliano Segundo, and Jos&eacute;  Arcadio Segundo. Then there are the women--the two &Uacute;rsulas, a handful of  Remedios, Fernanda, and Pilar--who struggle to remain grounded even as their menfolk build castles in the air.  If it is possible for a novel to be highly comic  and deeply tragic at the same time, thenOne Hundred Years of  Solitudedoes the trick. Civil war rages throughout, hearts break, dreams  shatter, and lives are lost, yet the effect is literary pentimento, with  sorrow's outlines bleeding through the vibrant colors of Garc&#xED;a M&aacute;rquez's  magical realism. Consider, for example, the ghost of Prudencio Aguilar, whom  Jos&eacute; Arcadio Buend&iacute;a has killed in a fight. So lonely is the man's  shade that it haunts Buend&iacute;a's house, searching anxiously for water with which  to clean its wound.

She begins her trip a prim schoolgirl returning home to her American family from England. From the start, there is something wrong with the Seahawk : the families that were to serve as Charlotte's chaperones do not arrive, and the unsavory crew warns her not to make the trip. When the crew rebels, Charlotte first sides with the civilized Captain Jaggerty, but before long she realizes that he is a sadist and--the only female aboard--she joins the crew as a seaman. Charlotte is charged with murder and sentenced to be hanged before the trip is over, but ends up in command of the Seahawk by the time it reaches its destination. Charlotte's repressive Puritanical family refuses to believe her tale, and the girl returns to the sea.

        "0061875724": "Product DescriptionThe prize-winning author ofLegend of a Suicidedelivers his highly anticipated debut novel.On a small island in a glacier-fed lake on Alaska's Kenai Peninsula, a marriage is unraveling. Gary, driven by thirty years of diverted plans, and Irene, haunted by a tragedy in her past, are trying to rebuild their life together. Following the outline of Gary's old dream, they're hauling logs to Caribou Island in good weather and in terrible storms, in sickness and in health, to build the kind of cabin that drew them to Alaska in the first place.But this island is not right for Irene. They are building without plans or advice, and when winter comes early, the overwhelming isolation of the prehistoric wilderness threatens their bond to the core. Caught in the emotional maelstrom is their adult daughter, Rhoda, who is wrestling with the hopes and disappointments of her own life. Devoted to her parents, she watches helplessly as they drift further apart.Brilliantly drawn and fiercely honest,Caribou Islandcaptures the drama and pathos of a husband and wife whose bitter love, failed dreams, and tragic past push them to the edge of destruction. A portrait of desolation, violence, and the darkness of the soul, it is an explosive and unforgettable novel from a writer of limitless possibility.A Q&amp;A with David VannQ:Set in Alaska,Caribou Islandis the story of a marriage&#x2019;s unraveling and the tragic events it precipitates. How does your setting reflect and shape the novel&#x2019;s plot and the characters, especially Irene and Gary?Vann:I think wilderness has no meaning on its own.  It&#x2019;s a giant mirror.  So as I was writingCaribou Island, I kept focusing on Alaska, and as I described the landscape I was indirectly describing and discovering the interior lives of Irene and Gary.  The island and lake are constantly shifting in shape and mood, and even the storms that come down off the glacier feel like they belong to Irene.  She resents taking care of this man for thirty years and receiving only his vacancy in return, and the desolation of the place increases the pressure on her.  There are no distractions, and no escape is possible.Q:You were born in Alaska and spent your childhood there. What was that experience like? What are your impressions of this state that has become such a focus of public consciousness?Vann:Alaska is magnificent, and the cold rainforest of Ketchikan, where I spent my childhood, is still mythic in my imagination.  In that forest, I always felt I was being watched, and we really did have bears and wolves.  There was so much undergrowth and deadfall, I&#x2019;d sometimes fall through the forest floor to a second floor and disappear completely.  And the ocean was even more impossible.  The first king salmon I caught was taller than I was, and my grandfather caught a 250-lb halibut.  I remember watching it slowly rising to the surface, growing until it became bigger than my imagination.  I write about Alaska because it&#x2019;s in that landscape that I can find some sense of self and possibility and freedom.Q:You have been very open about your family tragedies, including your father&#x2019;s suicide. Was it difficult approaching such a sensitive topic? How has using the raw material of these events affected you?Vann:It took me ten years to writeLegend of a Suicide, and I threw away everything from the first three or four years because there was too much emotion on the first page.  I had to learn to tell stories indirectly, and the writing had to become more than therapy.  Writing and therapy are both about truth, but only writing is about the beautiful.  What was ugly has to be transformed and become readable.  InCaribou Islandthere are again several true family stories in the background, but farther away than my father&#x2019;s suicide, and my focus again was on seeing how the stories would shift and become something else.Q:As a male writer, did you face any challenges capturing the voice of your female characters?Vann:I didn&#x2019;t expect to write about marriage, and I didn&#x2019;t expect to write from the viewpoint of a woman, but I saw that Irene was the center of the story, and that her daughter Rhoda was also vitally important.  I didn&#x2019;t struggle with voice or point of view at all for some reason, perhaps because my sympathies were with Irene and Rhoda and less with Gary and Jim.  To me, Irene and Rhoda make the best sense of the world and are the most honest, and this follows what I&#x2019;ve experienced in real life, also.  I was raised by women, and I trusted their accounts more than men&#x2019;s accounts.Q:How would you assess your evolution as a writer from your award-winning collectionLegend of a Suicideto this, your first novel? Did you find your voice naturally, or was it a struggle to find the right sound and rhythm?Vann:WithLegend of a Suicide, I was learning how to write.  The book is a short novel framed by five short stories, and I was tremendously influenced by various writers during that ten-year period, so the style and voice vary from story to story and form a kind of debate.  This makes sense for the material, because no one in my family could agree on who my father was, what happened, or what his suicide meant.  There was no one story or one voice to find anywhere.  ButCaribou Islandis a far more cohesive piece, and I wrote two pages per day in a kind of extended dream, hoping it would feel like it was written in one sitting.  And I didn&#x2019;t struggle at all with voice, because I think of writing as being mostly unconscious and out of control.  All I have to do is get out of the way and avoid having plans and ideas.  As long as I return each day to focus on place and character, the book writes itself.  The final published version is almost exactly the same as my first draft, and it just is what it is.  I don&#x2019;t think authors really get to choose what they write.Q:Who are the writers you admire?Vann:My favorite writers focus on landscape.  Cormac McCarthy&#x2019;sBlood Meridian, Annie Proulx&#x2019;sThe Shipping News, Marilynne Robinson&#x2019;sHousekeeping, and the poetry ofElizabeth Bishop.  These writers extend literal landscapes into figurative landscapes.  InBlood Meridian, for instance, we find mountains &#x201C;whose true geology was not stone but fear.&#x201D;  We focus on the real mountains and then they slip and shift and describe what we fear and desire and who we imagine ourselves to be.  We shape ourselves through place.",

Amelia's husband, Radcliffe Emerson (aka \"the Father of Curses\"), has been wooing Lord Carnavon and Howard Carter to let him excavate in the Valley of the Kings where they have digging rights, leading his competitors to think there must be something worth unearthing in the area. The eventual uncovering of King Tut's burial chamber and its magnificent contents attracts a host of museum curators, antiquities specialists, government officials, reporters and thieves. The arrival of Emerson's shady half-brother, Sethos, desperately ill and carrying a secret document, further complicates a plot involving attacks on the Emerson family, Middle East politics, conspiracies and love affairs. Once again Peters delivers an irresistible mix of archeology, action, humor and a mystery that only the redoubtable Amelia can solve.(Apr.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0060531088": "The concept of additional spatial dimensions is as far from intuitive as any idea can be. Indeed, although Harvard physicist Randall does a very nice job of explaining&mdash;often deftly through the use of creative analogies&mdash;how our universe may have many unseen dimensions, readers' heads are likely to be swimming by the end of the book. Randall works hard to make her astoundingly complex material understandable, providing a great deal of background for recent advances in string and supersymmetry theory. As coauthor of the two most important scientific papers on this topic, she's ideally suited to popularize the idea. What is absolutely clear is that physicists simply do not yet know if there are extra dimensions a fraction of a millimeter in size, dimensions of infinite size or only the dimensions we see. What's also clear is that the large hadron collider, the world's most powerful tool for studying subatomic particles, is likely to provide information permitting scientists to differentiate among these ideas soon after it begins operation in Switzerland in 2007. Randall brings much of the excitement of her field to life as she describes her quest to understand the structure of the universe.

        "0060506687": "With this engrossing mystery/suspense stand-alone novel, Lippman, winner of the Edgar, Shamus and Agatha awards for her series featuring likable heroine Tess Monaghan (Baltimore Blues; Charm City; The Last Place) solidifies her position in the upper tier of today's suspense novelists. Two 11-year-old children-good girl Alice Manning and bad girl Ronnie Fuller-wander homeward in Baltimore after being kicked out of a friend's pool party. They discover a baby in an unattended carriage by the front door of a house and steal it away. The reader watches in horror, knowing what will come next. The baby dies, and Alice and Ronnie are imprisoned for seven years. The mystery involves which girl did the killing, and which was the dupe. After release from prison, their blighted lives move inexorably toward further horror and tragedy. Lippman slowly relinquishes the facts of her story, building suspense as she reveals the past. Her well-honed prose is particularly suited to descriptions that impart more than just appearances: \"Holly was one of those people who seemed to be put together with higher quality parts than everyone else\"; \"...there was something menacing in the very fineness of his bones, as if a bigger boy had been boiled down until all that remained was this concentrated bit of rage and bile.\" With this book, much darker than any in her past series, Lippman shows she is an author willing to take risks in both writing and storytelling. Her deft handling of this disturbing material is sure to increase the breadth of her readership.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

The author, professor of behavioral economics at Duke, leads us through experiments that reveals such idiosyncrasies as the IKEA effect (if you build something, pride and sentimental attachment are likely to give you an inflated sense of its quality) and the Baby Jessica effect (why we respond to one person's suffering but not to the suffering of many). He concludes with prescriptions for how to make real personal and societal changes, and what behavioral patterns we must identify to improve how we love, live, work, innovate, manage, and govern.

        "0099908506": "The Sun Also Risesfirst appeared in 1926, and yet it's as fresh and clean and fine as it ever was, maybe finer. Hemingway's famously plain declarative sentences linger in the mind like poetry: \"Brett was damned good-looking. She wore a slipover jersey sweater and a tweed skirt, and her hair was brushed back like a boy's. She started all that.\" His cast of thirtysomething dissolute expatriates--Brett and her drunken fianc&eacute;, Mike Campbell, the unhappy Princeton Jewish boxer Robert Cohn, the sardonic novelist Bill Gorton--are as familiar as the \"cool crowd\" we all once knew. No wonder this quintessential lost-generation novel has inspired several generations of imitators, in style as well as lifestyle.Jake Barnes, Hemingway's narrator with a mysterious war wound that has left him sexually incapable, is the heart and soul of the book. Brett, the beautiful, doomed English woman he adores, provides the glamour of natural chic and sexual unattainability. Alcohol and post-World War I anomie fuel the plot: weary of drinking and dancing in Paris caf&eacute;s, the expatriate gang decamps for the Spanish town of Pamplona for the \"wonderful nightmare\" of a week-long fiesta. Brett, with fianc&eacute; and ex-lover Cohn in tow, breaks hearts all around until she falls, briefly, for the handsome teenage bullfighter Pedro Romero. \"My God! he's a lovely boy,\" she tells Jake. \"And how I would love to see him get into those clothes. He must use a shoe-horn.\"  Whereupon the party disbands.But what's most shocking about the book is its lean, adjective-free style.The Sun Also Risesis Hemingway's masterpiece--one of them, anyway--and no matter how many times you've read it or how you feel about the manners and morals of the characters, you won't be able to resist its spell.

If Elmore Leonard hadn't already used it for thesequeltoGet Shorty, it would have been a natural title for this deliciously breezy follow-up to another Leonard-to-Hollywood hit,Out of Sight. You may best recall Jack Foley, as played by George Clooney, bantering with Jennifer Lopez in the trunk of a jailbreak getaway car, but whenOut of Sightended, Foley was headed back to the clink to finish a 30-year bid.Road Dogsopens with Foley on the van to prison with Cundo Rey, a pint-size Cuban who soon engineers their early release--legally, this time. Jack's happy to be out and enjoying the California hospitality of Cundo and his wife Dawn (both Leonard veterans too, fromLaBravaandRiding the Rap). But Dawn is lovely and wily (and maybe a psychic), Cundo is a murderously jealous husband who may well think Jack owes him big-time, and Jack? Well, when you've robbed a hundred-twenty or so banks, is it that easy to go straight? As so often with Leonard, the real fun is less in the action than the talk, especially from Foley, the pleasure-minded, level-headed hood: an ex-con whose biggest con may be that he is exactly who he says he is.--Tom NissleyQuestions for Elmore LeonardQ:Where did the inspiration for the titleRoad Dogscome from?A:Road Dogswas on a list of prison expressions my researcher Gregg Sutter got for me: inmates who watch each other&#x2019;s back. I liked the sound of the words together.Q: What made you decide to bring back Jack Foley, Cundo Rey, and Dawn Navarro now? What is it about these three characters that stuck with you through the years?A:Foley was played by George Clooney inOut of Sight. I imagined George in the scenes I wrote and it worked. Dawn Navarro was the psychic inRiding the Rap, a supporting character ready for a leading role. Cundo Rey fromLaBrava, another favorite of mine, also deserved a bigger role, so I brought him back..Q: Any chance Foley and the woman he loves, Federal Marshal Karen Sisco, will be back in the near future?A:I&#x2019;m not sure Foley is up to robbing another bank. But Karen Sisco, the federal marshal inOut of Sight, could show up again; maybe working for her dad, a private investigator.Q: One of the hallmarks of your writing is your gift for the telling detail. When Foley is offering Cundo Rey&#x2019;s money man, Jimmy, some advice about his skimming, he tells him that Cundo won&#x2019;t kill him, but he might &#x201C;break your legs with a Jos&#233; Canseco bat.&#x201D; That&#x2019;s one of those small yet wonderfully deft touches that adds color without slowing the pace. How do you do this so well?A:Realism is the key to my style of writing and dialogue is what keeps it moving, always in live scenes. Rather than use my voice, my language, to describe what&#x2019;s going on, I let the characters tell who they are and what they&#x2019;re up to by the way they talk. Scenes are written from a character&#x2019;s point of view, never mine.Q: Many of your characters are working class stiffs and tough, intelligent broads. What draws you to these kind of characters? What do you think accounts for their popularity?A:My women often upstage the guys; they&#x2019;re natural, their own person, while my cops and criminals talk the way I&#x2019;ve observed them through research and being on the scene.Q: What&#x2019;s next for Elmore Leonard?A:Next comesDjibouti, with Dara Barr, a documentary filmmaker with the Somali pirates off the coast of East Africa.",
