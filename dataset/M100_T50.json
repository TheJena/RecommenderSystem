        "0061999245": "Like the series it inspired, Kellerman's award-winning 1986 debut novel combines police procedure, via hard-boiled LAPD detective Peter Decker, with Judaic rites and rituals courtesy of its heroine Rina Lazarus, an ultra-Orthodox widowed mother of two. Decker and Lazarus are brought together by the brutal rape of a young bride-to-be at the mikvah (a bathhouse used in the purification ritual) that Rina manages in the Hollywood hills. Mitchell Greenberg nicely vocalizes the story from Decker's point of view, with the detective struggling to stick to his sleuthing in spite of his developing feelings for Rina. The novel continually rings true, from explaining various Orthodox beliefs and customs to Decker and his crew's no-nonsense unmasking of the villain. Greenberg moves in and out of the novel's elements smoothly and efficiently. He paces the police work with just the right sense of urgency and frustration; handles the romantic sequences with the proper emotion and without a hint of sentimentality; and breezes through the many Jewish-centric passages with the confidence and clarity of a yeshiva graduate.An Avon paperback.

        "0099450259": "Mark Haddon's bitterly funny debut novel,The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, is a murder mystery of sorts--one told by an autistic version of Adrian Mole. Fifteen-year-old Christopher John Francis Boone is mathematically gifted and socially hopeless, raised in a working-class home by parents who can barely cope with their child's quirks. He takes everything that he sees (or is told) at face value, and is unable to sort out the strange behavior of his elders and peers.Late one night, Christopher comes across his neighbor's poodle, Wellington, impaled on a garden fork. Wellington's owner finds him cradling her dead dog in his arms, and has him arrested. After spending a night in jail, Christopher resolves--against the objection of his father and neighbors--to discover just who has murdered Wellington. He is encouraged by Siobhan, a social worker at his school, to write a book about his investigations, and the result--quirkily illustrated, with each chapter given its own prime number--isThe Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time.Haddon's novel is a startling performance. This is the sort of book that could turn condescending, or exploitative, or overly sentimental, or grossly tasteless very easily, but Haddon navigates those dangers with a sureness of touch that is extremely rare among first-time novelists.The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Timeis original, clever, and genuinely moving: this one is a must-read.--Jack Illingworth, Amazon.ca--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

Filled with a cast of unforgettable characters more richly drawn than any Lehane has ever created,The Given Daytells the story of two families--one black, one white--swept up in a maelstrom of revolutionaries and anarchists, immigrants and ward bosses, Brahmins and ordinary citizens, all engaged in a battle for survival and power. Beat cop Danny Coughlin, the son of one of the city&#x2019;s most beloved and powerful police captains, joins a burgeoning union movement and the hunt for violent radicals. Luther Laurence, on the run after a deadly confrontation with a crime boss in Tulsa, works for the Coughlin family and tries desperately to find his way home to his pregnant wife.Here, too, are some of the most influential figures of the era--Babe Ruth; Eugene O&#x2019;Neill; leftist activist Jack Reed; NAACP founder W. E. B. DuBois; Mitchell Palmer, Woodrow Wilson&#x2019;s ruthless Red-chasing attorney general; cunning Massachusetts governor Calvin Coolidge; and an ambitious young Department of Justice lawyer named John Hoover.Coursing through some of the pivotal events of the time--including the Spanish Influenza pandemic--and culminating in the Boston Police Strike of 1919,The Given Dayexplores the crippling violence and irrepressible exuberance of a country at war with, and in the thrall of, itself. As Danny, Luther, and those around them struggle to define themselves in increasingly turbulent times, they gradually find family in one another and, together, ride a rising storm of hardship, deprivation, and hope that will change all their lives.&#x201C;[An] engrossing epic. . . .

Swagger's sniper kills were legendary in Vietnam until an enemy bullet sent him into seclusion at his home in the Arkansas mountains. Retired Col. Schreck lures him back into \"the World\" on the pretense that he will be testing new bullets, but instead presses him into his special \"Agency\" unit. Swagger's job is to predict which site on the president's upcoming speaking tour a professional sniper would choose for an assassination attempt--so Schreck's unit can prevent it. Swagger calls the hit just right but is shot and framed in the assassination by Schreck's men. Only FBI agent and sniper ace Nick Memphis believes that Swagger is innocent. Memphis and Swagger trace the real assassin through the shootist network, making clever use of gun-lore magazines. They take on FBI bureaucrats, Schreck's nasties, Salvadoran death squads and local law agencies to get to the final showdown.

        "0060766123": "After the seemingly never-ending media coverage of pregnant Laci Peterson's Christmas Eve 2002 disappearance and husband Scott's subsequent arrest, trial, conviction and death-penalty sentence for her murder, it's hard to believe anything about this notorious case could still be \"untold.\" But Court TV anchor Crier and co-author Thompson's encyclopedic tome includes never-before-released transcripts of conversations between Scott and others (which don't significantly impact one's understanding of the case, however) and a 38-page appendix of photos, documents and other police evidence. Although much of the information in this book has been reported previously or revealed at trial, anyone looking for a comprehensive overview of the case will find it here. The authors chart not only the police investigation and trial but the personal and family history of Scott and Laci. A more balanced examination of the case is all that's missing to make this book really stand out. Up front, Crier states that since the first days of the case, she felt certain that Scott was a sociopath responsible for his wife's disappearance, and throughout the book, she demonstrates how and why. Given Scott's behavior in the weeks prior to and immediately after Laci's disappearance, not to mention all the lies he told to police, family and friends, she's not exactly going out on a limb. Although few people would doubt Scott's guilt, the whole book is very pro-police-it's even dedicated \"To all those who protect and serve.\" Had the authors started from a presumption of innocence and turned a critical eye on the investigation, which yielded more circumstantial than solid forensic evidence, the book would have been more compelling, but its thoroughness will draw many readers nonetheless. 12 pages of color photos.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Both belonged to a group of left-wing German activists who were forced into exile in London after Hitler came to power, and who risked everything to alert the world&#x2014;especially Britain, whose deliberate blindness grows increasingly infuriating in the novel&#x2014;to the danger the Nazis posed.

He relies on trusty pagan warlord Uhtred, but Uhtred's temper and an unexpected violent act force Uhtred to break his oath of loyalty to Alfred and flee north with his men, intending to reclaim his ancestral home. En route, they face marauding Danish armies, betrayal, battles for a pirate treasure, and the curse of a vicious Danish witch, only to eventually be manipulated back into fighting for Alfred. Vivid descriptions of merciless battlefield slaughter, rape, and destruction are artfully related by a masterful storyteller. Uhtred is victorious in some battles, but the outcome of others will have to wait for the sequel.(Jan.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "006173506X": "Cabot (Princess Diaries) winningly applies her trademark likably fallible protagonists and breezy storytelling to a vampire war in New York City. TV writer Meena Harper creates fabulous plots for Insatiable, the second-highest&ndash;rated soap opera, thanks to her burdensome if lucrative psychic ability to see into the future and determine how people are going to die. And just as Insatiable is switching to a vampire theme to attract a younger demographic, a spate of chilling murders-by-exsanguination grips New York City. Enter Lucien Antonescu, a sexy, melancholic Romanian history professor/vampire who recognizes that the murders are the work of rogue vampires who have broken away from his order. (Lucien happens to be the son of Vlad the Impaler, whom Bram Stoker gave such a bad rep.) Lucien's opposition: Alaric Wulf, a sympathetic detective from the Palatine Guard, who hopes to use Meena and her prophetic gift to stop the murders and track down Lucien. Unfortunately for Alaric, Meena is a little in love with Lucien. Cabot is less concerned with creating a convincing family tree for Lucien than with creating sparks between her characters, who feel pleasantly natural even as they live alongside the vampires next door.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0060887443": "In this solid debut thriller, a troubled doctor gets caught up in a global conspiracy after a mysteriously afflicted four-year-old Guatemalan boy dies on his watch. Pediatric ER physician Luke McKenna's curiosity is piqued when it seems the child's symptoms don't match any known disease; he's more intrigued, however, when hospital administrators and Guatemalan officials whisk away the child's body before McKenna can perform a postmortem investigation. While trying to beat back haunting, at times debilitating memories of his time in a shadowy military organization, McKenna continues to pursue the child's case, attracting the attention of a professional killer and the men behind him. It isn't until McKenna's framed for the murders of a former girlfriend and a football player that the good doctor becomes certain a conspiracy's afoot. From there, McKenna's on the run, using his old military training and contacts, as well as his medical expertise, to evade the cops and killers, get to Guatemala, try to uncover the forces he's up against and face his personal demons. Despite some clunky expository dialogue (practically a genre requisite) and a disappointing ending, Hawley delivers intense action, tricky plotting and an unpredictable hero sure to satisfy anyone with an appetite for a good page-turner.(Mar.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0061985848": "Gr 7 Up&#x2013;First in a trilogy, this clever, must-have debut focuses on sassy Evie, 16, who calls the International Paranormal Containment Agency home. Armed with her unique ability to see through all paranormal &#x201C;glamours&#x201D; and her trusty pink taser, Evie bags, tags, and helps IPCA track and contain a variety of familiar creatures. Despite her unconventional life (no origin story, mermaid best friend, werewolf colleagues, etc.), she considers herself to be pretty normal&#x2013;until shape-shifting elemental and extremely cute Lend breaks into IPCA looking for answers and ironically becomes one of the agency's latest puzzles. The more pressing concern: Who's been murdering paranormals? Lend's arrival; fae ex-boyfriend's (literally) hot, increasingly threatening advances; unsettling dreams; and a well-planned attack on the agency force Evie to face surprising revelations about IPCA and herself. White's storytelling successfully balances the fun and the sinister. There's an interesting mix of magic and technology. The pace is brisk with plenty of action. White's faeries (not vamps) are the beautiful and manipulative paranormals to watch out for, a refreshing change for some readers. Characterization is consistent, though Evie is the most fleshed out. A perfect blend of normal/supernatural, she simultaneously doubts her genetic makeup while yearning for and worrying about typical teenage concerns. Featuring a clever, kick-butt heroine channeling both Buffy and a PG Sookie, this book will likely fly off library shelves.&#x2013;Danielle Serra, Cliffside Park Public Library, NJ.

In the small town of New Canaan, N.H., 33-year-old Mariah discovers that her husband, Colin, is having an affair. Years ago, his cheating drove Mariah to attempt suicide and Colin had her briefly committed to an institution. Now Mariah's facing divorce and again fighting depression, when her eight-year-old daughter, Faith, suddenly acquires an imaginary friend. Soon this friend is telling the girl how to bring her grandmother back from the dead and how to cure a baby dying of AIDS. As Faith manifests stigmata, doctors are astounded, and religious controversy ensues, in part because Faith insists that God is a woman. An alarmed Colin sues for custody of Faith, and the fear of losing her daughter dramatically changes meek, diffident Mariah into a strong, protective and brave womanAone who fights for her daughter, holds her own against doctors and lawyers and finds the confidence to pursue a surprising new romance with TV atheist Ian Fletcher, cynical \"Spokesman of the Millennium Generation.\" Though the novel feels a bit long, Picoult's pacing stabilizes the increasingly complicated plot, and the final chapters, in which Mariah fights for Faith's custody in court, are riveting. The mother-daughter relationship is all the more powerful for being buffeted by the exploitative and ethically questionable domains of medicine, media, law and religion; these characters' many triumphant transformations are Picoult's triumphs as well.

        "006112429X": "A number of fictional attempts have been made to portray what might lead a teenager to kill a number of schoolmates or teachers, Columbine style, but Shriver's is the most triumphantly accomplished by far. A gifted journalist as well as the author of seven novels, she  brings to her story a keen understanding of the intricacies of marital and parental relationships as well as a narrative pace that is both compelling and thoughtful. Eva Khatchadourian is a smart, skeptical New Yorker whose impulsive marriage to Franklin, a much more conventional person, bears fruit, to her surprise and confessed disquiet, in baby Kevin. From the start Eva is ambivalent about him, never sure if she really wanted a child, and he is balefully hostile toward her; only good-old-boy Franklin, hoping for the best, manages to overlook his son's faults as he grows older, a largely silent, cynical, often malevolent child. The later birth of a sister who is his opposite in every way, deeply affectionate and fragile, does nothing to help, and Eva always suspects his role in an accident that befalls little Celia. The narrative, which leads with quickening and horrifying inevitability to the moment when Kevin massacres seven of his schoolmates and a teacher at his upstate New York high school, is told as a series of letters from Eva to an apparently estranged Franklin, after Kevin has been put in a prison for juvenile offenders. This seems a gimmicky way to tell the story, but is in fact surprisingly effective in its picture of an affectionate couple who are poles apart, and enables Shriver to pull off a huge and crushing shock far into her tale. It's a harrowing, psychologically astute, sometimes even darkly humorous novel, with a clear-eyed, hard-won ending and a tough-minded sense of the difficult, often painful human enterprise.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to theHardcoveredition.",

        "B00005QEFF": "Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

All that remains is the search for the truth behind his betrayal and the survival of its consequences.The StoryDeceived by the forces of evil into prematurely bringing about the end of the world, War - the first Horseman of the Apocalypse - stands accused of breaking the sacred law by inciting a war between heaven and hell. Dishonored and stripped of his powers, War must return to Earth to search for the truth and punish those responsible. But there is no clear definition of good and evil in this tale. Hunted by a vengeful group of angels, War must take on the forces of Hell, forge uneasy alliances with the very demons he hunts, and journey across the ravaged remains of the Earth on his quest for vindication. But the answers he seeks will reveal a deep conspiracy in which War will find, and have to resign himself to the reality that although once the hand of God, he is just a pawn in the eternal battle between heaven and hell.GameplayA mix of exploration and fast-paced action gameplay,Darksidersis based on nonlinear play situations. That means that as War slowly regains his previous powers of destruction and carnage in order to continue his search for the origins and reasons for his betrayal, players will be able to backtrack to areas and scenarios that they may have left unexplored upon first discovery. Almost all areas of the game can be explored and some of the things players will find as they do so are treasure chests, health chests, and bonus life points, etc. The ability to go back and explore areas is important, especially as the game progresses and War finds himself up against enemies whose defeat require special skills and/or weaponry.As for combat gameplay,Darksidersfeatures a variety of weapons--including blades and firearms--that can be used in combo moves or in single strikes. Some of these can be charged up for quick, but devastating attacks on enemies and all can be arranged on your controller's D-pad for easy and preferred access. Additional gameplay elements include the ability/necessity to fight from the back of your mount, Ruin, and the collection of the souls in the form of glowing orbs that fall to the ground as enemies are dispatched. The latter can be used to level up War with new items and abilities.Varied Characters and EnvironmentsAlthough players take on the imposing role or War,Darksidersalso contains a wide variety of equally intriguing and sometimes frightening characters. These include: an assortment of vengeful angels; demons, such as \"the Jailer\" whose body is made up of the remains of countless cadavers; a bestiary of wicked and vile creatures created to bolster the armies of hell on Earth; and Ruin, the trusty steed of War. Gameplay environments players will experience are equally varied, and include areas both underground and on the surface, that call to mind both familiar, if ruined modern urban environments, as well as ones seemingly pulled from the nightmarish scenes of the biblical apocalypse.Key FeaturesApocalyptic Power of War- Unleash the wrath of War, combining brutal attacks and supernatural abilities to decimate all who stand in your way.Extreme Arsenal- Wield a devastating arsenal of angelic, demonic, and Earthly weapons, and blaze a trail of destruction atop Ruin, War's fiery phantom steed.Epic Quest- Battle across the wastelands and demon-infested dungeons of the decimated Earth in your quest for vengeance and redemption.Character Progression- Uncover powerful ancient relics, upgrade your weapons, unlock new abilities, and customize your gameplay style.Battle Heaven and Hell- Battle against all who stand in your way&mdash;from war-weary angelic forces to hell's hideous demon hordes.Weapons and Gear-Darksidersfeatures an extensive arsenal and inventory of weapons and gear.Varied Play Environments- Players will fight through varied environments, including those above and underground, and modern and nightmarishly mythical in design.PlayStation Network- Although a single player game,Darksidersfeatures PlayStation Network Trophy support and other features to heighten the gameplay experience.",

Citing Plato, Buddha and modern brain science, psychologist Haidt notes the mind is like an \"elephant\" of automatic desires and impulses atop which conscious intention is an ineffectual \"rider.\" Haidt sifts Eastern and Western religious and philosophical traditions for other nuggets of wisdom to substantiate&mdash;and sometimes critique&mdash;with the findings of neurology and cognitive psychology. The Buddhist-Stoic injunction to cast off worldly attachments in pursuit of happiness, for example, is backed up by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's studies into pleasure. And Nietzsche's contention that what doesn't kill us makes us stronger is considered against research into post-traumatic growth. An exponent of the \"positive psychology\" movement, Haidt also offers practical advice on finding happiness and meaning. Riches don't matter much, he observes, but close relationships, quiet surroundings and short commutes help a lot, while meditation, cognitive psychotherapy and Prozac are equally valid remedies for constitutional unhappiness. Haidt sometimes seems reductionist, but his is an erudite, fluently written, stimulating reassessment of age-old issues.(Jan.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It certainly offers the same gripping cockpit view of modern air combat, in this case over Iraq in two wars and patrolling U.S. skies after 9/11. Hampton recounts his training as a pilot, then his selection for F-16s&#x2014;officially the Fighting Falcon but known in the USAF as the Viper&#x2014;and finally his training for the most demanding flying done in the F-16, the Wild Weasel missions. These missions are dedicated to the neutralization or, preferably, destruction of enemy air defenses and date back to the first encounters with SAMs, in the Vietnam War. As the radars and missiles on the ground have improved, so have the technology and skills of the Wild Weasel pilots, who must keep themselves and their comrades alive in an air full of high-tech hostility. Hampton is a vivid writer and an unabashed warrior, and, like most such, he has doubts about the future of American armed forces if they are to be commanded by men who are neither warriors themselves nor particularly empathetic toward those who are.

The inclusion of subtitle \"Origins\" in the game's title refers to the six unique origin stories available to new heroes as a new game begins. Each of these has an impact on the player's motivations and his or her experience, and renders a unique prelude, path, and possible ending(s) to the game. There are many different endings to the game based on the origin story of the character and the choices you make as you play through the game. The game features three character classes--warrior, mage, and rogue--and three races of being--Human, Elf or Dwarf--that can assume these classes. Although most game elements, such as weapons, magic, etc., are available to any character, each class and race has different strengths, abilities and affinities which lend themselves to better utilizing different elements.Dragon Age: Originsis a single player game based on party-based gameplay and combat where the player can join, control and quest with up to three non-player characters (NPCs). Players can also quest alone if they so choose, but with the chance of survival are slim. Convincing NPCs to join you, and treating them well may be necessary depending on the varying sentiments between the player and the NPC, or between the NPC's in the party based on the chosen history written into the origin story accepted at the beginning of the game. This uncertainty allows for a variety of possible dynamics within the party ranging from open hostility, all the way to romance. The game progresses in real-time via a pause-and-play tactical combat system that allows the player to check inventory levels, equip a character, etc. in a slight vacuum.

        "006039384X": "Maguire has a lock on clever, elaborate retellings of fairy tales, turning them inside out and couching them in tongue-in-cheek baroque prose. After his revisionist takes on Oz's Wicked Witch of the West (Wicked) and Cinderella's ugly stepsisters (Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister), he now tackles Snow White. The notorious Borgia habit of poisoning rivals inspired him to transplant the classic tale to 16th-century Tuscany, where Vicente de Nevada is an expatriate Spanish widower who lives with his daughter, the fair Bianca. Beholden to sinister Cesare Borgia and Cesare's sister (and perhaps lover) Lucrezia, Vicente is sent on what appears to be a fool's errand, to discover and steal from a Middle East monastery a branch of the Tree of Knowledge complete with three apples. When Bianca is 11, Cesare's attraction to her causes the envious Lucrezia to order a young hunter to murder her and deliver her heart in a casket. Bianca, of course, is spared and taken in by seven dwarfs. But this is not Disney; the dwarfs are boulders, stirred to life by Bianca's arrival (\"a clothed, bearded obstinacy became slowly apparent\"). Several years pass in surreal, dreamlike fashion, with Bianca tending to the dwarfs, who cavort stiffly and philosophize collectively. When Vicente returns successful, Lucrezia poisons an apple for her rival. Innocent Bianca's fate is gentle, but that of the corrupt Lucrezia, in brilliant Venice, is appropriately grotesque. Fairy tales in their original form are often brutal and disturbing; with his rich, idiosyncratic storytelling, Maguire restores the edge to an oft-told tale and imbues it with a strange, unsettling beauty.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.",

        "B0002TB4CW": "Early Adopters Pick: March 2003. As the  world's smallest video-game platform, the Game Boy Advance SP is also the first to use a built-in rechargeable battery.Many decried the original Game Boy Advance's reflective LCD screen and its reliance on external light sources. The Game Boy Advance SP's main feature--optional backlighting--fixes this complaint nicely, but it's the wealth of other features that makes this system so surprisingly good.At first look, you might think the SP is a sleek travel alarm clock. When closed, it's just as tall and deep as the original GBA, but only half as wide. Due to its clamshell design, the screen is always protected from everyday scratches. A small button in the center of the console turns on the backlighting element for use in low-light situations, like in a moving car.The SP comes with a well-designed power adapter that recharges a built-in battery; its prongs fold in for easier storage. Our informal tests found that it takes about four hours to fully charge (you can even play it while it's plugged in and charging), and the battery lasts about 11 hours with the backlighting constantly on--your results may vary. Using the backlighting less often will conserve battery power.With  separately sold  cables, you can connect the Game Boy Advance SP to other GBAs  for multiplayer gaming (above) or to the  Nintendo GameCube  (below) to access secret levels, exchange data, or use other special  features that vary from game to game.The quality of the backlighting is very good. It's bright and clear when looking directly at it, but degraded from other angles. This is only a problem for friends who are watching the screen from over your shoulder.But size, power, and affordability do not come without trade offs. There's no headphone jack here, though Nintendo promises an adapter. The system isn't very loud at its highest volume, and the sound can be turned down to socially acceptable levels. The L and R shoulder buttons are a fraction of the size they were on the GBA, and thus are harder to hit. Also, the reduced size of the SP is slightly less comfortable for adult hands than the GBA, but perhaps more comfortable for smaller hands. The cartridge port placement on the lower part of the console is fine for GBA games, since they are flush with the console body, but older Game Boy Color carts will stick out in a way that takes some getting used to.Open it up and the hinge will seek out a preferred, pre-set angle (about 150 degrees), though you can open it a bit wider or narrower for your own comfort. The hinge stands up well to lateral pressure, and over all, the SP seems just as rugged as its predecessor--which has proven to be very rugged, indeed.--Porter B.

        "006009026X": "ABC News political commentator and NPR news analyst Roberts didn't intend this as a general history of women's lives in early America-she just wanted to collect some great \"stories of the women who influenced the Founding Fathers.\" For while we know the names of at least some of these women (Martha Washington, Abigail Adams, Eliza Pinckney), we know little about their roles in the Revolutionary War, the writing of the Constitution, or the politics of our early republic. In rough chronological order, Roberts introduces a variety of women, mostly wives, sisters or mothers of key men, exploring how they used their wit, wealth or connections to influence the men who made policy. As high-profile players married into each other's families, as wives died in childbirth and husbands remarried, it seems as if early America-or at least its upper crust-was indeed a very small world. Roberts's style is delightfully intimate and confiding: on the debate over Mrs. Benedict Arnold's infamy, she proclaims, \"Peggy was in it from the beginning.\" Roberts also has an ear for juicy quotes; she recounts Aaron Burr's mother, Esther, bemoaning that when talking to a man with \"mean thoughts of women,\" her tongue \"hangs pretty loose,\" so she \"talked him quite silent.\" In addition to telling wonderful stories, Roberts also presents a very readable, serviceable account of politics-male and female-in early America.

The initial class project is a baby blanket, and Macomber (Changing Habits), a knitter herself who offers tips about the craft and pithy observations from knitting professionals throughout the novel, includes the knitting pattern at the start of the book. Well-heeled Jacqueline Donovan, who chooses to ignore her empty marriage, disguises her disdain for her pregnant daughter-in-law by knitting a baby blanket. Carol Girard joins the group as an affirmation of her hopes to finally have a successful in vitro pregnancy. Alix Townsend, a high school dropout with an absentee father and a mother incarcerated for forging checks, uses the class to satisfy a court-ordered community service sentence for a drug-possession conviction for which her roommate is really responsible. Unfortunately, Macomber doesn't get much below the surface of her characters, and, although they all have interesting back stories, the arc of each individual happy ending is too predictable. The only surprise involves Alix's hapless, overweight roommate, Laurel, and even this smacks of plot-driven manipulation.

Border stories shine a spotlight on many aspects of American history: the 49th parallel was chosen for the northern borders of Minnesota, North Dakota, and Montana because they ensured England's access to the Great Lakes, vital to their fur trade; in 1846, Washington D.C. residents south of the Potomac successfully petitioned to rejoin Virginia (called both \"retrocession\" and \"a crime\") in order to keep out free African-Americans. Aside from tales of violent conquest and political glad-handing, there's early, breathtaking tales of American politicos' favorite sport, gerrymandering (in 1864, Idaho judge Sidney Edgerton single-handedly \"derailed\" Idaho's proposed boundary, to Montana's benefit, with $2,000 in gold). American history enthusiasts should be captivated by this fun, informative text.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

In the third in Lemony Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events, there is still no hope on the horizon for these poor children. Their adventures are exciting and memorable, but, as the author points out, \"exciting and memorable like being chased by a werewolf through a field of thorny bushes at midnight with nobody around to help you.\"This story begins when the orphans are being escorted by the well-meaning Mr. Poe to yet another distant relative who has agreed to take them in since their parents were killed in a horrible fire. Aunt Josephine, their new guardian, is their second cousin's sister-in-law, and she is afraid of everything. Her house (perched precariously on a cliff above Lake Lachrymose) is freezing because she is afraid of the radiator exploding, she eats cold cucumber soup because she's afraid of the stove, and she doesn't answer the telephone due to potential electrocution dangers. Her greatest joy in life is grammar, however, and when it comes to the proper use of the English language, she is fearless.But just when she should be the most fearful--when Count Olaf creeps his way back to find the Baudelaire orphans and steal their fortune--she somehow lets her guard down. Once again, it is up to Violet, Klaus, and Sunny to get themselves out of danger. Will they succeed? We haven't the stomach to tell you.

With financial assistance from a rich relative, it's purchased by 23-year-old Willie Traynor, formerly the paper's cub reporter. Soon afterward, his new business receives the readership boost it needs thanks to his editorial efforts and coverage of a particularly brutal rape and murder committed by the scion of the town's reclusive bootlegger family. Rather than shy from reporting on the subsequent open-and-shut trial (those who oppose the Padgitt family tend to turn up dead in the area's swampland), Traynor launches a crusade to ensure the unrepentant murderer is brought to justice. When a guilty verdict is returned, the town is relieved to find the Padgitt family's grip on the town did not sway the jury, though Danny Padgitt is sentenced to life in prison rather than death. But, when Padgitt is released after serving less than a decade in jail and members of the jury are murdered, Clanton once again finds itself at the mercy of its renegade family.When it comes, the d&#xE9;nouement is no surprise;The Last Juroris less a story of suspense than a study of the often idyllic southern town of Clanton, Mississippi (the setting for Grisham's first novel,A Time to Kill). Throughout the nine years between Padgitt's trial and release, Traynor finds acceptance in Clanton, where the people \"don't really trust you unless they trusted your grandfather.\" He grows from a long-haired idealist into another of the town's colorful characters--renovating an old house, sporting a bowtie, beloved on both sides of the color line, and the only person to have attended each of the town's 88 churches at least once.The Last Jurorreturns Grisham to the courtroom where he made his name, but those who enjoyed the warm sentiment of his recent novels (Bleachers,A Painted House) will still find much to love here.--Benjamin Reese--This text refers to theHardcoveredition.",

Rather than telling a new story, she tells an old one (scarcely lacking for historians) in a fresh way. Shlaes brings to the tale an emphasis on economic realities and consequences, especially when seen from the perspective of monetarist theory, and a focus on particular individuals and events, both celebrated and forgotten (at least relatively so). Thus the spotlight plays not only on Andrew Mellon, Wendell Wilkie and Rexford Tugwell but also on Father Divine and the Schechter brothers&mdash;kosher butcher wholesalers prosecuted by the federal National Recovery Administration for selling \"sick chickens.\" As befits a former writer for theWall Street Journal, Shlaes is sensitive to the dangers of government intervention in the economy&mdash;but also to the danger of the government's not intervening.

Upon his long-awaited return, he gives the children a fantastical and descriptive explanation of the adventures he faced while trying to make it back home.

In fact, the ability to focus, more than IQ or social background, is the key to performance and success. Neuroscience, case studies, and personal experience contribute to Goleman&#x2019;s exploration of focus, which includes concentration, selective attention, open awareness, self-awareness, empathy, and systems awareness. He breaks them down to inner, other, and outer focus. Among examples of the significance of focus: a doctor&#x2019;s ability to shut down emotions to focus on gory medical procedures; an epidemiologist&#x2019;s attention to patterns and systems to track the human connections that lead to global pandemics; and a gamer&#x2019;s focus on spatial perception, decision making, and ability to track objects.

The game was revealed to the world at the Microsoft press conference held at Grauman's Chinese Theater in Hollywood, CA in May 2006. To gamer's delight, the announcement was a complete surprise. The rumors have been abound for the past year, as everyone wondered when the next installment would be ready. Bungie and Microsoft did a stellar job keeping their lips sealed, and fans benefited from their first glimpse of the hallowed third and final installment.The short presentation was delivered in real-time on the Xbox 360 using the current version of theHalo 3game engine. That's right, no studio production video, Bungie and Microsoft delivered the real deal: what they showed at the announcement is what gamers will see when they play Halo 3 in 2007. The HDR lighting, self-shadowing, GPU-run particle system and many other effects are rumored to show up in full effect in the final game. Needless to say, the gaming community is salivating.CJ Cowan, Bungie's director of cinematics discussed one of the most startling moments of the presentation: the return of Cortana. \"Given the variety of character and story arcs at the end ofHalo 2, we wanted to boil down our announcement to a few key threads. Cortana and the Chief being a galaxy apart is a situation we haven't seen before, and is something that is a powerful component toHalo 3. We are using her transmissions in the demo to give the viewer a few subtle clues to her situation and state of mind, without revealing any specifics we want to save for the game itself.\"Graphically, the game closely follows in the tradition ofHalo 2, although it has been upgraded to take advantage of the Xbox 360's more prodigious visual abilities. As art direct Marcus Lehto explained, \"[The presentation] was intended to be an understated announcement ofHalo 3-- the tone is that of mystery and suspense -- the calm before the storm. I wanted to make sure that we reintroduced the Chief, showed that Earth was thoroughly conquered, with Covenant everywhere, and that there is a glorious, ancient artifact buried under the Earth's crust which will provideHalo 3with the epic journey which we all want.\"Taking full advantage of the power of Xbox 360,Halo 3expands on everything that has made the franchise great, adding a wealth of technical and gameplay advancements. The game design has evolved with next-generation, high-definition visuals, enhanced A.I., an advanced real-time lighting engine, and, of course, new weapons, characters, and challenges.Halo 3promises an unparalleled first-person shooter experience and, in the end, the most compelling and engrossing story in the franchise's history.

        "B000066JRN": "Six years. Six long years we&#x92;ve had to wait for a new Mario game, and finally it&#x92;s here. And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet. That may be no more than you'd expect from a Mario game, but it's certainly more than most of us mere mortals deserve.--David Jenkins",
        "B00004XOWT": "If the original PlayStation was the video game console equivalent of the  '60s-era Volkswagen Beetle--economic, reliable, loads of fun--the PS One could  be considered the new Beetle--a hip restyling of those same qualities.Make no mistake: the PS One has all of the same functionality as the original  PlayStation workhorse, will work with all of the same peripherals and  accessories, and will play the existing PlayStation game library, as well as  audio CDs (also note that, like the original PlayStation, it's not compatible  with the more advancedPlayStation  2). The difference here is that this new model is quite a bit smaller than  its older brother, and quite a bit cuter, too.The system is made up of a 32-bit, 34-MHz RISC processor with 16 Mbits of main  memory, 8 Mbits of graphics memory, 24-channel stereo sound, double-speed CD-ROM  drive, and one Dual Shock analog controller. That's not a lot of power, compared  to a next-generation system like theSega  Dreamcast; but, when you factor in its very low price and the enormous  library of games that are available (more than 1,000 that are spread across  every genre imaginable), one can see easily why it's as good a deal as ever. If  rumors of exciting future accessories for the PS One (a four-inch LCD screen  attachment, to name one) are true, this little machine could become a great  option for the on-the-go gamer.--Porter Hall",

After graduating from the University of Alabama with a degree in English and Creative Writing, she moved to New York City, where she worked in magazine publishing and marketing for nine years.The Helpis her first novel.Kathryn Stockett:This is by far your most epic novel to date.  How long did it take you to writeThe Shoemaker&rsquo;s Wife?Adriana Trigiani:I worked on this story for over 20 years as I wrote scripts and novels and had my own family. There are scraps of paper, dinner napkins, and bills with timelines and notes scrawled across them. There are old notebooks filled with my grandmother&rsquo;s musings from 1985. I collected train tickets, copies of ships&rsquo; manifests, and a silk tag with my grandmother&rsquo;s name from garments she had created. I traveled as far as the Italian Alps and as close as the few blocks it takes me to walk to Little Italy in New York City to capture the historical aspects of the story. All of this went into the novel. It was a delicious gestation period.Stockett:This is a novel, but it is inspired by a true story&mdash;a family story, right?Trigiani:Yes&mdash;my grandparents, Lucia and Carlo. Their love was a dance with fate. It is riddled with near misses against a landscape of such massive world events that it&rsquo;s a wonder they got together atall. My challenge was to present their world to the reader so it might feel it was happening in the moment. I wanted the reader to have the experience I had when stories were told to me by the woman who lived them.Stockett:The novel takes place during the first half of the twentieth century--what is so compelling about this period of time to you?Trigiani:The cusp of the twentieth century was a time everything was new&mdash;cars, phones, planes, electricity, even sportswear, and in each innovation was a kind of explosive potential. No one could predict where all the inventions would lead, people only knew that change was unavoidable.My grandparents were delighted every time America presented them with something they had never seen before. And my grandparents&rsquo; sense of wonder never left them, so I tried not to let it leave the page, be it a cross-country train ride or the first snap of the bobbin on an electric Singer sewing machine.Stockett:Through the remarkable story of Enza and Ciro, your novel tells the larger story of the immigrant experience in America.Trigiani:What a gift immigrants were and are to this country! They bring their talents and loyalty and make our country even greater. My grandparents were proud to be new Americans. Assimilation was not about copying an American ideal, but aspiring to their own version of it. The highest compliment you could pay a fellow immigrant was: he (or she) was ahard worker. I hear the phrasework like an immigrantsaid, but really, it&rsquo;s bigger than that&mdash;we must alsodream like immigrants.Stockett:The Shoemaker&rsquo;s Wifeseamlessly brings together fictional characters and historical figures&mdash;how did the wonderful Caruso enter the novel?Trigiani:It started with a three-foot stack of vinyl records&mdash;my grandmother Lucia&rsquo;s collection of Caruso. Her absolute devotion to The Great Voice lasted her whole life long. I knew, in order to write this novel, I had to fall in love with Caruso too, because he sang the score of my grandparents&rsquo; love affair.When Lucia passed, I went to my first opera, seeking understanding and comfort. As the music washed over me, I began to understand why my grandmother was such a fan. The words were Italian, and the emotions were big; nothing was left unexpressed in the music.

Thankfully, the jaw-dropping graphics are matched up to a very playable  shoot-'em-up concept that works as a slightly more in-depth version of the PS2'sStar Wars Starfighter,  except without any of thatEpisode Inonsense. Rather, it re-creates  everything from the Death Star trench run to the Battle of Hoth.The game is actually a sequel toRogue Squadronfor the N64--an excellent  game that many only remember from the rather lackluster PC version. It's  structurally very similar to the original, with a dozen or so levels and a Star  Destroyer full of secret levels and ships. The game does feature a few new  ideas, such as controllable wingmen and ground troops, and some of the levels  are set in deep space rather than planetside, but at its heart this is stillRogue Squadrondeluxe.What elevates the game to an object of worship is the graphics--they really do  look almost identical to the movie's, with several scenes appearing like exact  copies. The ships move with a fluidity and grace you wouldn't have thought  possible from such a tiny purple cube. The only flaw is that the missions are  needlessly short, but there's plenty of replayability, and by gosh there's those  graphics.--David Jenkins--Amazon.co.uk",

        "006135323X": "Irrational behavior is a part of human nature, but as MIT professor Ariely has discovered in 20 years of researching behavioral economics, people tend to behave irrationally in a predictable fashion. Drawing on psychology and economics, behavioral economics can show us why cautious people make poor decisions about sex when aroused, why patients get greater relief from a more expensive drug over its cheaper counterpart and why honest people may steal office supplies or communal food, but not money. According to Ariely, our understanding of economics, now based on the assumption of a rational subject, should, in fact, be based on our systematic, unsurprising irrationality. Ariely argues that greater understanding of previously ignored or misunderstood forces (emotions, relativity and social norms) that influence our economic behavior brings a variety of opportunities for reexamining individual motivation and consumer choice, as well as economic and educational policy. Ariely's intelligent, exuberant style and thought-provoking arguments make for a fascinating, eye-opening read.(Feb.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Samantha is abandoned by her husband in the opening pages of this three-handkerchief special, and the resultant tremors keep her off-balance for most of the novel. There are practical problems aplenty, of course, including a shortage of money and an 11-year-old son to raise. But Sam's sense of emotional bereavement is far worse, despite the fact that her husband had been giving her the conjugal cold shoulder for years:I miss David so much, yes I do, I miss the presence of another person in my bed at night, even if he doesn't touch me; the reliability of someone else being there in the morning, even if they only shave and stare straight ahead into the mirror while you lean against the bathroom doorjamb with your cup of coffee, chatting hopefully.The loneliness in her \"as constant and as irrefutable\" as circulating blood, Sam begins to rebuild her life. She finds herself a job and takes in a couple of boarders to help meet her mortgage payments. (One of them, a depressed student named Lavender Blue, informs her that \"life was nothing but one major disappointment after the other\"--the sort of homily that Sam is understandably reluctant to hear these days.)

Browning, a thorough historian who lets no one off the moral hook nor fails to weigh any contributing factor--cowardice, ideological indoctrination, loyalty to the battalion, and reluctance to force the others to bear more than their share of what each viewed as an excruciating duty--interviewed hundreds of the killers, who simply could not explain how they had sunken into savagery under Hitler.

Brother Juniper wonders if the tragedy happened according to a divine plan or was simply a random instance of misfortune. His curiosity leads him to investigate the lives of the five victims to prove that the bridge collapse and the resulting deaths were indeed divine intervention&#x2014;that God intended for them to die then and there. But, of course, the point of the novel is that there is no commonality among them, other than the fact that they are all simply human, with their own frailties. Wilder ends his at-once urgent and serene novel with this haunting passage: &#x201C;But soon we shall die and all memory of these five will have left the earth, and we ourselves shall be loved for a while and forgotten. But the love will have been enough; all those impulses of love return to the love that made them. Even memory is not necessary for love.

        "006017143X": "Many years ago, when the first volume ofTales of the Citywas going to press, Christopher Isherwood compared its author's narrative gifts to those of Charles Dickens. This has proven to be the blurb of a lifetime, an ever-renewable currency appearing on almost all of Armistead Maupin's subsequent books. Yet it has held up well--Dickens's gentle satire and broad good humor live on in Maupin more than in any other English-speaking writer.The Night Listeneris his most ambitious work to date. While not strictly autobiographical, the story does teasingly suggest correspondences to the author's own life in a way that will delight and frustrate his many fans. The main character, Gabriel Noone, is a professional storyteller who broadcasts roughly autobiographical sketches for a long-running PBS series, \"Noone at Night,\" stories about people \"caught in the supreme joke of modern life who were forced to survive by making families of their friends.\"  When the novel opens, Gabriel is still reeling from the announcement that his much younger, longtime partner Jess (a.k.a. Jamie in the \"Noone at Night\" stories, and a.k.a. Terry Anderson, Maupin's real-life, much-younger partner, for those who like to track associations) wants to move into his own apartment and start dating other men.  With the success of his HIV cocktail, Jess has exceeded his own life expectancy. Having prepared himself so well to die, he now needs to learn how to live again. To Gabriel's distress, Jess's new life involves leather, multiple piercings, and books on men's drumming circles.When an editor sends Gabriel yet another book to blurb, he reluctantly opens the package to find a long, rending memoir by Pete Lomax, an HIV-positive 13-year-old survivor of incest, rape, and sexual slavery. The book is calledThe Blacking Factory, after the miserable London bottling factory where Dickens spent part of his poverty-stricken childhood. As Gabriel reflects:Pete thinks we all have a blacking factory, some awful moment, early on, when we surrender our childish hearts as surely as we lose our baby teeth. And the outcome can't be called. Some of us end up like Dickens;  others like Jeffrey Dahmer. It's not a question of good or evil, Pete believes.  Just the random brutality of the universe and our native ability to withstand it.After Pete escaped from his parents and was adopted by a therapist named Donna Lomax, his slow recovery was helped along by his memoir-writing and by frequent doses of \"Noone at Night.\"Touched by Pete's devotion to his stories, as well as the boy's obvious need for a father figure, Gabriel finds himself drawn into an intense relationship with his young fan, involving long, late-night phone calls that begin to worry Gabriel's friends.  And, other than their mutual need, how much does he really know about Pete, anyway?   As Gabriel begins to question his own motives, as well as those of the boy,The Night Listenertransforms itself from an absorbing but quotidian story of loss and midlife angst into a dark and suspenseful page-turner with a playful metaphysical aspect and an un-Dickensian sexual candor.--Regina Marler",

InBlood  and Gold, Rice mostly (but not entirely) avoids the danger of treading worn  ground as she fills out the life and character of Marius the Lonely, the  Disenchanted, the Heartsick--a 2,000-year-old vampire \"with all the conviction  of a mortal man.\"Plucked from his beloved Rome in the prime of his life and forced into solitude  as keeper of the vampire queen and king, Marius has never forgiven the injustice  of his mortal death.

Humanity's collective intelligence will save the day, just as it has over the centuries. Ridley puts current perceptions about violence, wealth, and the environment into historical perspective, reaching back thousands of years to advocate global free trade, smaller government, and the use of fossil fuels.

        "0099908506": "The Sun Also Risesfirst appeared in 1926, and yet it's as fresh and clean and fine as it ever was, maybe finer. Hemingway's famously plain declarative sentences linger in the mind like poetry: \"Brett was damned good-looking. She wore a slipover jersey sweater and a tweed skirt, and her hair was brushed back like a boy's. She started all that.\" His cast of thirtysomething dissolute expatriates--Brett and her drunken fianc&eacute;, Mike Campbell, the unhappy Princeton Jewish boxer Robert Cohn, the sardonic novelist Bill Gorton--are as familiar as the \"cool crowd\" we all once knew. No wonder this quintessential lost-generation novel has inspired several generations of imitators, in style as well as lifestyle.Jake Barnes, Hemingway's narrator with a mysterious war wound that has left him sexually incapable, is the heart and soul of the book. Brett, the beautiful, doomed English woman he adores, provides the glamour of natural chic and sexual unattainability. Alcohol and post-World War I anomie fuel the plot: weary of drinking and dancing in Paris caf&eacute;s, the expatriate gang decamps for the Spanish town of Pamplona for the \"wonderful nightmare\" of a week-long fiesta. Brett, with fianc&eacute; and ex-lover Cohn in tow, breaks hearts all around until she falls, briefly, for the handsome teenage bullfighter Pedro Romero. \"My God! he's a lovely boy,\" she tells Jake. \"And how I would love to see him get into those clothes. He must use a shoe-horn.\"  Whereupon the party disbands.But what's most shocking about the book is its lean, adjective-free style.The Sun Also Risesis Hemingway's masterpiece--one of them, anyway--and no matter how many times you've read it or how you feel about the manners and morals of the characters, you won't be able to resist its spell. This is a classic that really does live up to its reputation.--David Laskin--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

        "0061852058": "Combine a few tried and true romance tropes, like the wallflower spinster and the jaded rake, with some improbable but amusing misadventures, and you have the makings of an entertaining Regency debut. Lady Calpurnia Hartwell, a plain but wealthy 28-year-old who refuses to marry a man who only desires her fortune, acts on a long-held crush and flings herself at Gabriel St. John, marquess of Ralston. Gabriel finds her antics more amusing than enticing, but his half-wild half-sister needs an impeccable chaperone and he chooses Callie for the role. Their proximity creates an infinite series of opportunities for the rake to practice his wiles on the more than willing wallflower. The 19th-century clothes are luscious, the 21st-century sensibility is raunchy, and it's all implausible, escapist fun.(Apr.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "006001203X": "Designed to catapult your body into a state of fat meltdown, Dr. Atkins's diet has taken America by storm. It targets insulin, the hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. The bodies of most overeaters are continually in a state of hyperinsulinism; their bodies are so adept at releasing insulin to help convert excess carbohydrates to fat that there's always too much of the hormone circulating through the body. This puts the body into a bind; it always wants to store fat. Even when people with hyperinsulinism try to lose weight--especially when they cut fat but increase carbohydrate consumption--their efforts will fail. This is why Dr. Atkins refers to insulin as &quot;the fat-producing hormone.&quot;Dr. Atkins's diet is extremely low in carbohydrates, which helps to regulate insulin production and decrease circulating insulin; less insulin soon results in less fat storage and fewer food cravings. The diet is far from torturous, though--those who've tried it attest that hunger isnota part of this plan. Ninety percent of Dr. Atkins's patients--more than 25,000 of them--have experienced dramatic weight loss. The book includes recipes for such luscious, low-carb dishes as lobster soup, zabaglione, sea bass, and blueberry ice cream, and even includes a carbohydrate gram counter and menus.--This text refers to an alternatePaperbackedition.",

        "006073132X": "Economics is not widely considered to be one of the sexier sciences. The annual Nobel Prize winner in that field never receives as much publicity as his or her compatriots in peace, literature, or physics. But if such slights are based on the notion that economics is dull, or that economists are concerned only with finance itself, Steven D. Levitt will change some minds. InFreakonomics(written with Stephen J. Dubner), Levitt argues that many apparent mysteries of everyday life don't need to be so mysterious: they could be illuminated and made even more fascinating by asking the right questions and drawing connections. For example, Levitt traces the drop in violent crime rates to a drop in violent criminals and, digging further, to the Roe v. Wade decision that preempted the existence of some people who would be born to poverty and hardship. Elsewhere, by analyzing data gathered from inner-city Chicago drug-dealing gangs, Levitt outlines a corporate structure much like McDonald's, where the top bosses make great money while scores of underlings make something below minimum wage. And in a section that may alarm or relieve worried parents, Levitt argues that parenting methods don't really matter much and that a backyard swimming pool is much more dangerous than a gun. These enlightening chapters are separated by effusive passages from Dubner's 2003 profile of Levitt inThe New York Times Magazine, which led to the book being written. In a book filled with bold logic, such back-patting veersFreakonomics, however briefly, away from what Levitt actually has to say. Although maybe there's a good economic reason for that too, and we're just not getting it yet.--John Moe",

Harry Hole investigates, along with Beate L&oslash;nn, a young detective with the ability to remember every face she's ever seen. Meanwhile, Harry receives a call from Anna Bethsen, a woman he hasn't seen in years. After he meets Anna, recovering alcoholic Harry awakens the next morning with a hangover and the news that Anna is dead, apparently by her own hand. While Harry quietly looks into Anna's death, he and Beate uncover ties in their bank robbery case to one of Norway's most notorious bank robbers, who's currently in prison. The deeper Harry digs, the clearer it becomes that Anna's death is linked to the robbery.

        "0061558265": "Amazon Guest Review: Stephen King onThe Night EternalStephen Kingis the author of more than 50 books, all of them worldwide best-sellers. Among his most recent are theDark Towernovels,Cell,From a Buick 8,Everything's Eventual,Hearts in Atlantis,The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, andBag of Bones. He is the recipient of the 2003 National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters. He lives in Bangor, Maine, with his wife, novelist Tabitha King.The Straintrilogy opened with an authentic wow moment: a Boeing 777 arrives at JFK airport with all but four of the passengers dead in their seats. The flashlight beams of the first responders &ldquo;registered dully in the dead jewels of their open eyes.&rdquo; Not much later these corpses begin to rise from their morgue slabs, and a plague of blood-hungry predators overwhelms New York. The first hundred pages ofThe Strainis a sustained exercise in terror that held this reader in spellbound delight, because del Toro and Hogan write with crisp authenticity about both the fantastical (vampires) and the completely real (New York City, with all its odd nooks and crannies).What began inThe Straincomes to a sublimely satisfying conclusion inThe Night Eternal. Del Toro and Hogan have taken Dracula, the greatest vampire tale of them all, and deftly turned it inside out. In Stoker&rsquo;s novel, Bloodsucker Zero arrives in England on a sailing ship called the Demeter. As with the Regis Air 777, the Demeter is a ghost ship when it reaches port, the eponymous Count having snacked his way across the ocean. The difference is that Dracula is confronted by a heroic band of vampire-hunters who eventually drive him from England by using modern technology&mdash;everything from diaries kept on wax recording cylinders to blood transfusions. InThe StrainTrilogy, the body-hopping Master&mdash;who arrives at JFK in the person of Polish nobleman Jusef Sardu&mdash;uses the very technology that defeated his honorable forebear to destroy the civilized world. Big corporations are his tools; modern transportation serves to spread the vampire virus; nuclear weapons usher in a new era of pollution and atmospheric darkness.Only jolly old England escapes; the wily Brits have blown up the Chunnel early on, and remain relatively vampire-free. At moments like this, the reader senses del Toro and Hogan tucking their tongues in their cheeks and having a gleeful blast.When speaking of the New World Order in Henry the Sixth, Shakespeare has one of his characters say, &ldquo;The first thing we do, let&rsquo;s kill all the lawyers.&rdquo; As TheNight Eternalopens, the Master (currently having traded the body of Sardu for that of rock star Gabriel Bolivar) doubles down on that, ordering his minions to kill not just those in the legal profession but all the CEOs, tycoons, intellectuals, rebels, and artists.  &ldquo;Their execution was swift, public and brutal. Out they marched, the damned, out of the River House, the Dakota, the Beresford and their ilk&hellip;in a horrific pageant of carnage, they were disposed of.&rdquo;With the exception of heroic pawnbroker/scholar Abraham Setrakian (who almost destroyed the Master in Volume Two,The Fall), the winning cast of human characters from the previous novels are all present and accounted for: Nora Martinez, who has traded in her scientist&rsquo;s microscope for a silver sword; Vasily Fet, who now exterminates vampires instead of rats; Augustin &ldquo;Gus&rdquo; Elizade, once a gangbanger and now a hero of resistance. There&rsquo;s also the less-than-admirable but fascinating (in a repulsive way, it&rsquo;s true) Alfonso Creem, with his insatiable appetite and his vampire-repelling mouthful of silver teeth.And there&rsquo;s Eph Goodweather, the epidemiologist around whom all these others revolve. WhenThe Night Eternalbegins, two years after the Master has used nuclear weapons to create vampire-friendly darkness all over the planet, Eph has fallen on hard times. His undead ex-wife stalks him relentlessly (he is, after all, one of her &ldquo;Dear Ones&rdquo;), his son has become a rifle-toting, obsessive-compulsive acolyte of the Master, and Eph himself has started popping Vicodin and oxycodone. Nora has left him for Vasily Fet, and Eph is viewed with distrust by those who used to rally around him. Justifiable distrust; he keeps showing up late for meetings and vampire-killing gigs.Fet has managed to purchase a rogue nuke (it&rsquo;s wrapped in garbage bags and looks like a trashcan), and the resistance fighters have a sacred book that may&mdash;if deciphered&mdash;lead them to the Black Site where the Master&rsquo;s earthly life began. If they can destroy that holy soil, they believe the vampire plague will end.There&rsquo;s a certain amount of perhaps dispensable hugger-mugger about vampires in Rome and archangels in Sodom, but the main attractions here are the resistance fighters&rsquo; fierce dedication to their cause, and Eph Goodweather&rsquo;s slow and painful realization that if he destroys the Master, he may also destroy his son Zachary, the last person on earth he truly loves. Heroes of tragic dimension are rare in popular fiction, but Goodweather fills the bill nicely.After a small (and perhaps unavoidable&mdash;see Tolkein&rsquo;s The Two Towers) letdown inThe Fall,The StrainTrilogy comes to a rip-roaring conclusion inThe Night Eternal. The action is non-stop, and the fantasy element is anchored in enough satisfying detail to make it believable. All the New York landmarks, such as Central Park&rsquo;s Belvedere Castle and The Cloisters, are real. And while you&rsquo;re discovering such essential vampire facts as the undead&rsquo;s inability to cross running water without human help, you&rsquo;ll also find out that the stone lions outside the New York Public Library have names: Patience and Fortitude. Plus, come on, admit it&mdash;there&rsquo;s something about seeing vampires massing for an attack in a Wendy&rsquo;s parking lot that makes them more real. The devil&rsquo;s in the details, and this is one devilishly good read full of satisfying scares. --Stephen King",

Krentz and his dog, Blue, had been missing since that morning. They were last heard from when he radioed his brother to say that he&#8217;d found an illegal alien on the property and was going to offer him assistance. The man Krentz encountered that day shot and killed him and his dog, without warning, before escaping to Mexico.It&#8217;s difficult to overstate the impact of Krentz&#8217;s death, which turned the issue of Arizona&#8217;s unsecured border&#8212;a crisis that the federal government had repeatedly ignored&#8212;into a national concern. As Arizona sheriff Larry Dever said in his testimony before the Senate Homeland Security Committee, &#8220;We cannot sit by while our citizens are terrorized, robbed, and murdered by ruthless and desperate people who enter our country illegally.&#8221; This momentum helped pass SB 1070, a bill that authorizes local law enforcement under certain conditions to question persons reasonably suspected of being illegal aliens, which Governor Jan Brewer and the state legislature had been working on for months. With the passage of this controversial bill, the state of Arizona became ground zero in the impassioned debate over illegal immigration. The Democrats and the media went into overdrive, denouncing the state and its governor as racists and Nazis.Governor Brewer, a lifelong Arizona resident with deep ties to the community, was first elected to the Arizona House of Representatives in 1982, and hasn&#8217;t lost an election since. As a state official, she watched with increasing dismay as illegal immigration exploded across Arizona&#8217;s border, and noticed the devastating effect it was having on the state. Causing an escalation in violence, an influx of drugs, and prisons and hospitals to fill to overflowing, this problem was not only wreaking havoc on the moral fabric of the community but placing an even greater strain on Arizona&#8217;s beleaguered health, educational, and social welfare networks. Growing frustrated with the failure of the federal government to respond to her pleas for assistance, Governor Brewer led the state to action.Scorpions for Breakfastis Brewer&#8217;s commonsense account of her fight to secure our nation&#8217;s border in the face of persistent federal inaction.

Along the Atlantic coastline, a monster &#151; somehow familiar, yet still quite different from anything ever seen &#151; has been snatching little girls and bringing them back to the undersea city. It is a Big Sister, new denizens of Rapture who were once one of the forgotten little girls known as Little Sisters, known to inhabit the city's dank halls. No longer a pawn used to harvest ADAM, the dangerously powerful gene-altering lifeblood of Rapture, from the bodies of others and in turn run the risk of being harvested herself, the Big Sister is now the fastest and most powerful thing in Rapture. You, on the other hand are the very first Big Daddy, in fact the prototype, that for some reason has reactivated. You are similar to the Big Daddies familiar from the originalBioShock, but also very different in that you possess free will and no memory of the events of the past ten years. The question is, as you travel through the decrepit and beautiful fallen city beneath the waves, hunting for answers and the solution to your own survival, are you really the hunter, or the hunted?Gameplay and MultiplayerInBioShock 2players will take on the role of the original Big Daddy, not that of game one protagonist, Jack. As a Big Daddy you will have access to all the strengths and weapons of a standard Big Daddy, including the drill and rivet gun. More importantly you also possess free will and the ability to use plasmids and gene tonics &#151; genetic modifications allowed for through ADAM, a stem cell harvested from conquered enemies, or sea slugs outside the Rapture air lock, and powered by the in-game injectable serum known as EVE, which can be found, captured or purchased. Plasmids and gene tonics provide a wide range of aggressive and passive abilities which can be upgraded and arranged for quick use. The ability to use plasmids and tonics gives you a decided edge over other Big Daddies and most other denizens of Rapture, excluding the powerful Big Sisters. In addition, due to their role as a Big Daddy, players will experience a new relation to the Little Sisters. Upon defeating standard Big Daddys you are given the familiar choice as to whether to harvest or adopt them. Harvesting gains you ADAM immediately, but could alter your path through the game, while adopting makes you responsible for Little Sisters, who then accompany you through Rapture, but also provide aid and warning in times of danger. Additional gameplay features include: new plasmids, weapons and the ability to combine these two.The game also features the anticipated multiplayer modes.

        "B00005YTYJ": "WithGrand Theft Auto III, Rockstar proves that not all  developers are concerned with toning down the violence in their games.  This sequel is even more bloody, violent, and sadistic than its popular  predecessors, offering up an enormous 3-D city in which nearly any  criminal act is possible. Players are free to steal cars, beat up the  local population for their money (or weapons), make time with  prostitutes, or simply roam to their heart's content. Those seeking  more structure can embark on dozens of plot-driven missions or steal  cars that let them play minigames. Nab a cop car and go on vigilante  missions. Grab a cab and play a deadly version ofCrazy Taxi.  Take a fire truck and earn money putting out fires. The game just never  gets boring.As in real life, there are consequences for your criminality. As your  random acts of mayhem mount up, the police start hounding you,  eventually calling in SWAT trucks, the FBI, and even the army if you  continue down the path of destruction. Shaking these pursuers is easily  the most fun part of the game, especially when a bunch of friends are  packed in the room to witness your narrow escapes.Grand Theft Auto IIIis fine-tuned to near perfection in every  category. All the vehicles, from slick sports cars to lumbering dump  trucks, handle exactly as you'd expect and smash apart realistically  when abused. The three islands in the game are rendered in terrific  detail considering their size, and are packed with traffic,  pedestrians, and hidden jumps. The audio is equally amazing.  Pedestrians talk, cops scream at you, and you can tune in nine  different radio stations whenever you are in a car. It all adds up to a  monumental achievement: the rare console game for adults that manages  to get everything right.--T. Byrl BakerNote: This review refers to thePlayStation2 versionof  this game.Pros:Offers an enormous world for players to exploit, rendered in  staggering detailEqually fun whether you go on plot-based missions or run around as  a freelance crookCons:Ultraviolence, foul language, and adult situations mean you'll want  to keep this far away from kidsIt takes too long to get from one island to another, making some  missions tedious",
        "0061710245": "The carefully constructed home Darling had created in her Manhattan apartment began to fall apart when her husband died.  When their only child left for college, and the nest emptied completely, Darling knew she had to reinvent or rediscover herself lest she succumb to the cumulative grief of both events.  She abandoned the verve and bustle of New York for the pervasive solitude of Vermont, buying a remote backwoods cabin that could only generously be called rustic.  Darling discovers that what she doesn&#x2019;t know about rural life is nearly eclipsed by what she doesn&#x2019;t know about herself, yet her determination to learn not only how to live but how to survive is a project she embraces with a journalist&#x2019;s passion for truth and fact-finding.  Along with unrelenting loneliness and unyielding Yankee stoicism, Darling also confronts her own mortality when she is diagnosed with breast cancer.  Darling has written a fierce and forthright chronicle of one formidable woman&#x2019;s courageous journey of healing and revelation, gratitude and resilience. --Carol Haggas",

        "0062072188": "Amazon Exclusive: Daniel Silva on WritingPortrait of a Spywith a PencilWhile on book tour, I&rsquo;ve been surprised to find that readers are fascinated by how writers actually write. Most readers hold in their mind an idealized image of the novelist at work&mdash;a figure in a trendy urban coffeehouse, a solitary figure walking along an empty beach. The truth, however, is seldom so romantic.Before going any further, let us stipulate that, much like the hero of my novels, the art restorer and spy Gabriel Allon, I am something of a creature of habit. I work seven days a week, from early in the morning until six thirty in the evening, when I stop to watch the evening news. My work clothing never varies: gray sweatpants by Russell Athletic, a long-sleeve T-shirt by L.L. Bean, fleece Acorn moccasins, and discount cotton socks from Marks &amp; Spencer in England. Occasionally, visitors to our house will catch a glimpse of this outfit, but, for the most part, my wife and children tend to shield me from public view. As a rule, I don&rsquo;t answer the telephone&mdash;unless it is a family emergency of some sort&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t read e-mail. I nibble rather than eat.Portrait of a Spy, like all the Gabriel Allon novels, was fueled largely by McVitie&rsquo;s digestive biscuits.I have a computer, of course, but I really do most of my actualwritingin longhand, on yellow legal pads. I prefer to work while lying on the floor rather than at my desk. This annoys my wife because she took a great deal of time and effort to have a desk custom made to fit my office. When I showed her a photograph of Muriel Spark, one of her literary heroes, writing in longhand stretched across a floor, she was only partially mollified. Sometimes we talk about living somewhere other than Georgetown. Secretly, the very idea terrifies me. After writing 14 books in the same room of the same house, I am afraid I have lost the ability to work anywhere else.As for my writing instrument of choice, it is unquestionably the pencil. There is something about the sound it makes scratching across the page that, for me, is the essence of composition. The pencil is the antithesis of all things cyber and e, a means of returning, however briefly, to a world that is unconnected and unwired. A pad and pencil do not freeze or crash. There are no viruses or error messages. If a thunderstorm knocks out the power, the words will still be there when the lights come on again. And then, there is the satisfying natural rhythm of the work itself&mdash;the turning of the completed page, the sharpening of the dulled point, the fortnightly disposal of the fluffy wooden shavings.Lately, I have been hoarding pencils. I&rsquo;m not sure precisely when it began; I suspect it had something to do with the death of the typewriter. An irrational fear gripped me, a fear that pencils were next. If the typewriter could go extinct, how could the lowly, environmentally hostile pencil possibly hope to survive in the brave new world? I now order my favorite brand&mdash;the Paper Mate Mirado Black Warrior No. 2&mdash;by the case. I am reasonably confident I now have enough pencils on hand to see me through the next several novels&mdash;though, if I happen to misplace a pencil, I will search the house thoroughly before removing a new one from its special drawer and sharpening it for the first time. To sharpen a virgin pencil is, in a sense, to commit an act of assisted suicide. It saddens me.I wish it were not so. I wish I could write on a computer while traveling on an airplane or sitting in a strange hotel room, but I cannot. I have become a prisoner of my office. I need my floor, and my Mirado Black Warrior No. 2 pencils, and my McVitie&rsquo;s digestive biscuits. I hoard them, too. I keep them on a special shelf in the storage room, next to my socks from Marks &amp; Spencer.Copyright &copy; Daniel Silva 2011. All Rights Reserved.",

Well, you get this rollickin&#x2019; adventure in which Pocket, the royal fool introduced in Moore&#x2019;s Fool (2009), is lured to Venice, where he thinks he&#x2019;ll be having a fun time with the beautiful Portia, but where three men (including a fella named Iago) are actually planning to murder him. To some, the idea of combining two Shakespeare plays and an Edgar Allan Poe short story might be vaguely chilling. To begin with, Moore, author of such delights as Sacre Blue (2012) and The Stupidest Angel (2004), has to move the events of the plays from the late sixteenth century to the thirteenth to keep the chronology in line with the events recounted in Fool, which means &#x201C;Amontillado&#x201D; is moved roughly 500 years back in time. And let&#x2019;s not forget that the plays are tragedies, whereas this book, which also interpolates elements of King Lear, from which Fool was derived, is a farce. The upshot is, if you&#x2019;re the kind of reader who insists Shakespeare is untouchable, then this novel will probably annoy you on general principles. On the other hand, if you&#x2019;re a fan of Moore&#x2019;s brand of history-mangling humor, you&#x2019;ll dive right in with a big grin on your face. The grins win in the end. --David Pitt",

Instead of exploring this weighty material, Gibson focuses on such lighthearted frolics as whipped-cream fights in the aisles of Kate's grocery store. Because Rob remains literally and figuratively behind the wheel of his Hummer and Kate never fully faces her own demons, their romance lacks emotional heft. Gibson also portrays Gospel's elderly citizenry as cartoonish, rendering what could have been a poignant romance between Kate's grandfather and Rob's mother as condescendingly sweet.

        "0060531258": "In her spirited, witty, inimitable style, Quinn (It's in His Kiss) wraps up her Regency era Bridgerton series with a tale that takes to task the notion of love at first sight. Gregory Bridgerton's six siblings have all fallen prey to love, so he figures he need only sit back and wait for \"the one\" to waltz into his life. Then he meets Hermione Watson. The \"breathtakingly perfect curve of her neck\" convinces Gregory that she's destined to be his, but Hermione's practical, plainspoken friend Lucy Abernathy throws cold water on his aspirations when she informs him that Hermione's heart belongs to another. Quinn's final Bridgerton romance brings the series to a gratifying close. Although some readers will wish that it contained more of the sibling camaraderie that has propelled the series so ably&mdash;and less repetitive description of the protagonists' flaws&mdash;this tale is as frothy and festive as a glass of bubbly, and more than worthy of a toast.(July)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He said it began the summer Dill came to us, when Dill first gave us the idea of making Boo Radley come out.\"Set in the small Southern town of Maycomb, Alabama, during the Depression,To Kill a Mockingbirdfollows three years in the life of 8-year-old Scout Finch, her brother, Jem, and their father, Atticus--three years punctuated by the arrest and eventual trial of a young black man accused of raping a white woman. Though her story explores big themes, Harper Lee chooses to tell it through the eyes of a child. The result is a tough and tender novel of race, class, justice, and the pain of growing up.Like the slow-moving occupants of her fictional town, Lee takes her time getting to the heart of her tale; we first meet the Finches the summer before Scout's first year at school. She, her brother, and Dill Harris, a boy who spends the summers with his aunt in Maycomb, while away the hours reenacting scenes fromDraculaand plotting ways to get a peek at the town bogeyman, Boo Radley.

Then Atticus is called on to defend the accused, Tom Robinson, and soon Scout and Jem find themselves caught up in events beyond their understanding. During the trial, the town exhibits its ugly side, but Lee offers plenty of counterbalance as well--in the struggle of an elderly woman to overcome her morphine habit before she dies; in the heroism of Atticus Finch, standing up for what he knows is right; and finally in Scout's hard-won understanding that most people are essentially kind \"when you really see them.\" By turns funny, wise, and heartbreaking,To Kill a Mockingbirdis one classic that continues to speak to new generations, and deserves to be reread often.--Alix Wilber--This text refers to theMass Market Paperbackedition.",

        "0060753943": "If you judge books by their covers, Jack Welch'sWinningcertainly grabs your attention. Testimonials on the back come from none other than Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, Rudy Giuliani, and Tom Brokaw, and other praise comes fromFortune,Business Week, andFinancial Times. As the legendary retired CEO of General Electric, Welch has won many friends and admirers in high places. In this latest book, he strives to show why.Winningdescribes the management wisdom that Welch built up through four and a half decades of work at GE, as he transformed the industrial giant from a sleepy \"Old Economy\" company with a market capitalization of $4 billion to a dynamic new one worth nearly half a trillion dollars.Welch's first book,Jack: Straight from the Gut, was structured more as a conventional CEO memoir, with stories of early career adventures, deals won and lost, boardroom encounters, and Welch's process and philosophy that helped propel his success as a manager. InWinning, Welch focuses on his actual management techniques. He starts with an overview of cultural values such as candor, differentiation among employees, and inclusion of all voices in decision-making. In the second section he covers issues around one's own company or organization: the importance of hiring, firing, the people management in between, and a few other juicy topics like crisis management. From there, Welch moves into a discussion of competition, and the external factors that can influence a company's success: strategy, budgeting, and mergers and acquisitions. Welch takes a more personal turn later with a focus on individual career issues--how to find the right job, get promoted, and deal with a bad boss--and then a final section on what he calls \"Tying Up Loose Ends.\" Those interested in the human side of great leaders will find this last section especially appealing. In it, Welch answers the most interesting questions that he's received in the last several years while traveling the globe addressing audiences of executives and business-school students. Perhaps the funniest question in this section comes at the very end, posed originally by a businessman in Frankfurt, who queried Welch on whether he thought he'd go to heaven (we won't give away the ending).While different from the steadier stream of war stories and real-life examples of Welch's first book,Winningis a very worthwhile addition to any management bookshelf. It's not often that a CEO described as the century's best retires, and then chooses to expound on such a wide range of management topics. Also, aside from the commentary on always-relevant issues like employee performance reviews and quality control, Welch suffuses this book with his pugnacious spirit. The Massachusetts native who fought his way to the top of the world's most valuable company was in many ways the embodiment of \"Winning,\" and this spirit alone will provide readers an enjoyable read.--Peter Han",

        "B00002DHEV": "Nintendo first dabbled in video games during the industry's early years of the mid-'70s. Generations of successful gaming console releases through the years led to the much-hyped 1996 launch of Nintendo 64, a system that represented a giant evolutionary leap in video game technology. Within the first three days of launch, hundreds of thousands of gamers hunkered down withMario 64, considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever created. Even today, the system's excellent design continues to host an ever-expanding library of breakthrough games.Nintendo 64's popularity among younger gamers is no surprise. Well-respected games featuring such long-lived and much-loved personalities as Mario (of arcade classicDonkey Kongfame), Zelda, andBanjo-Kazooieare easy to learn and offer enormous replay value. But times are a' changin' and the system's ever-growing library of titles has expanded into every genre of games imaginable, including games better-suited for older gamers. In fact, some of the most acclaimed--in some cases, groundbreaking--games available on any platform today are packed onto N64's old-school cartridges.Under the system's hood, its appeal to the young certainly didn't produce a less mature gaming machine. On the contrary, the 64-bit system boasts impressive graphics, stereo sound, and numerous accessory enhancements, including a high-resolution pack that boosts graphics to awe-inspiring resolutions.Start your library withGoldeneye 007,Mario 64,Banjo Kazooie,Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, andStar Wars: Episode One Racer--these titles represent a decent start to any N64 cartridge library.With the recent launch of Sega's Dreamcast system, Nintendo 64 is being left behind as the leader in video game technology. And with newer game systems featuring CD-based games, the system's expensive cartridge format is proving itself an archaic and unconventional storage format. But, at a sub-$100 recommended retail price, innovative accessory enhancements and a great library of games keep the system's rabid fan base satisfied, if not eager for Nintendo's next evolutionary step.--Eric Twelker",

        "0007124015": "A Christian can almost be forgiven for not reading the Bible, but there's no salvation for a fantasy fan who hasn't read the gospel of the genre, J.R.R. Tolkien's definitive three-book epic, the Lord of the Rings (encompassingThe Fellowship of the Ring,The Two Towers, andThe Return of the King), and its charming precursor,The Hobbit. That many (if not most) fantasy works are in some way derivative of Tolkien is understood, but the influence of the Lord of the Rings is so universal that everybody from George Lucas to Led Zeppelin has appropriated it for one purpose or another.Not just revolutionary because it was groundbreaking, the Lord of the Rings is timeless because it's the product of a truly top-shelf mind. Tolkien was a distinguished linguist and Oxford scholar of dead languages, with strong ideas about the importance of myth and story and a deep appreciation of nature. His epic, 10 years in the making, recounts the Great War of the Ring and the closing of Middle-Earth's Third Age, a time when magic begins to fade from the world and men rise to dominance. Tolkien carefully details this transition with tremendous skill and love, creating in the Lord of the Rings a universal and all-embracing tale, a justly celebrated classic.--Paul Hughes--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

The Olympic dreams of teenaged equestrian Annemarie Zimmer end when her beloved horse, Harry, injures her and destroys himself in a jumping accident. In the agonizing aftermath, she gives up riding and horses entirely. Two decades later, she returns to her family's horse farm a divorcee, with her troubled teenaged daughter, Eve, in tow. There, her gruff Germanic mother struggles to maintain the farm and care for Annemarie's father, who is stricken with ALS. Although Annemarie decides (disastrously) to manage the farm's business, her attention quickly turns to an old and ostensibly worthless horse with the same rare coloring as Harry. Her long-denied passion for riding reawakens as she tracks the horse's identity and eventually discovers it to be Harry's younger brother. She must heal both horse and herself as she struggles with her father's deterioration, Eve's rebellion and her attraction to both the farm's new trainer and her childhood sweetheart Dan. Impulsive and self-absorbed, Annemarie isn't always likable, but Gruen's portrait of the stoic elder Zimmers is beautifully nuanced, as is her evocation of Eve's adolescent troubles. Amid this realistically complex generational sandwich, the book's appealing horse scenes&#x97;depicted with unsentimental affection&#x97;help build a moving story of loss, survival and renewal.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Although the Arkham asylum is well fortified, he has a nagging feeling that all is not well, which proves to be the case when seconds after turning The Joker over to the guards, the master criminal breaks free of his captors. Even more surprising than this quick turn of events is the revelation that it was never The Joker's intent to escape the vault-like facility, but instead to trap Batman there. Surrounded by an asylum full of dangerous criminals, many of which he put there and all at the beck and call of the Joker, can Batman survive and discover what is behind the Joker's intricate plot?GameplayInBatman: Arkham Asylumplayers strap on the gadget-heavy utility belt of the Caped Crusader. Gameplay here is a combination of both the knuckle crunching rush of hand to hand combat as you take on the hordes of thugs that infest Arkham Asylum, and stealth gameplay in which you must dispatch individuals from the shadows. Players can expect an engrossing single player campaign in which Batman continually moves forward to face the henchmen, bosses and traps that The Joker has set for him. With regards to opponents, in addition to The Joker who you will hear more than you see, the dark walls of Arkham also hold familiar villains from the the Batman criminal universe including Harley Quinn, Victor Zsasz and Killer Croc, that you will have to deal with, but don't expect a one-dimensional experience. As players progress from environment to environment within Arkham they will have to use varying combinations of muscle, detective skills, gadgetry and a certain degree of light RPG-like leveling of Batman's skills, arsenal and physical characteristics to survive and discover what The Joker's underlying scheme is.In addition to the story-driven single player campaignArkham Asylumalso contains various additional play modes. These include an arcade styled combat mode where players accumulate points by engaging hordes of thugs in a hand to hand slugfest across a series of maps, in which Batman's physical strength and agility play a major role. The key here is to chain together as many attacks as possible due to the fact that with each successful combo players increase the point multiplier associated with their actions. The game also features a time-based stealth mode where players must hone their ability to strike silently from the shadows. This gameplay, referred to as 'Invisible Predator' utilizes the Dark Knight's skill with gadgets like the grapple tool, batarang and explosives. These allow for vertical/horizontal mobility, the ability to quickly strike from above and at a distance and to take out enemies and create distractions, even through walls. But remember that Batman works solo and is not superhuman. Your enemies will congregate around trouble areas and work as a team against you, so you must be silent, plan your attacks wisely, strike quickly and discover the value of encouraging fear within enemies.Key FeaturesExperience the game in a whole new way with Game of the Year Edition extras including: Access to the playable Joker character (in the PS3 version only) and the Joker Challenge maps and 4 additional standard challenge maps.Utilize the unique FreeFlow combat system to chain together unlimited combos seamlessly and battle with huge groups of The Joker's henchmen in brutal melee brawls.Investigate as Batman, the world's greatest detective, by solving intricate puzzles with the help of cutting edge forensic tools including x-ray scanning, fingerprint scans, 'Amido Black' spray and a pheromone tracker.Face off against Gotham's greatest villains including The Joker, Harley Quinn, Victor Zsasz and Killer Croc.Become the Invisible Predator with Batman's fear takedowns and unique vantage point system to move without being seen and hunt enemies.Choose multiple takedown methods, including swooping from the sky and smashing through walls, and use the predator camera get a closer look at the action.Explore every inch of Arkham Asylum and roam freely on the infamous island, presented for the first time ever in its gritty and realistic entirety.Experience what it's like to be Batman using batarangs, explosive gel aerosol, the Batclaw, sonar resonator and the line launcher.Unlock more secrets by completing hidden challenges in the world and develop and customize equipment by earning experience points.Enjoy complete superhero freedom in the environment with the use of Batman's grapple to get to any place you can see, jump from any height and glide in any direction.",

Battered, bruised, and lamed sea serpents have returned to the Rain Wild River to lay eggs that will hatch into dragons. But the dragon hatchlings are feeble, misshapen, unable to fly. They can't even survive without the assistance of human Dragon Keepers. Keepers and dragons make a perilous foray up the river in search of the long lost Elderling city of Kelsingra, which possibly holds the key to the dragons' survival. Tight bonds unite the humans to their ancient liveship Tarma, but as they voyage upriver they find the landscape hideously altered by earthquakes and storms. Starvation stalks them, and the bonds among humans, at least, fray even without any open treachery gnawing at them. The Rain Wilds is one of the most gripping settings in modern fantasy, highly to Hobb's credit, and an entire novel amid its lowering trees and rock formations would be impossible to put down even without Hobb's superior skills at characterization. Let us applaud, and shelve this with the rest of Hobb's magisterial fantasy fiction, though it won't stay on the shelf long. --Roland Green",
        "009956064X": "The rediscovery and rejuvenation of Richard Yates's 1961 novelRevolutionary Roadis due in large part to its continuing emotional and moral resonance for an early 21st-century readership. April and Frank Wheeler are a young, ostensibly thriving couple living with their two children in a prosperous Connecticut suburb in the mid-1950s. However, like the characters in John Updike's similarly themedCouples, the self-assured exterior masks a creeping frustration at their inability to feel fulfilled in their relationships or careers. Frank is mired in a well-paying but boring office job and April is a housewife still mourning the demise of her hoped-for acting career. Determined to identify themselves as superior to the mediocre sprawl of suburbanites who surround them, they decide to move to France where they will be better able to develop their true artistic sensibilities, free of the consumerist demands of capitalist America. As their relationship deteriorates into an endless cycle of squabbling, jealousy and recriminations, their trip and their dreams of self-fulfillment are thrown into jeopardy.Yates's incisive, moving, and often very funny prose weaves a tale that is at once a fascinating period piece and a prescient anticipation of the way we live now. Many of the cultural motifs seem quaintly dated--the early-evening cocktails, Frank's illicit lunch breaks with his secretary, the way Frank isn't averse to knocking April around when she speaks out of turn--and yet the quiet desperation at thwarted dreams reverberates as much now as it did years ago.

This parasitic species infects other life forms with a virus that rapidly mutates victims into new Chimera. In mere decades this race has ripped apart populations across Asia and Europe and by 1951 has landed on the shores of England.

An alien race began toying with the planet just after Word War I and in mere decades, the Chimera &#x2568; a species of unknown origin propagating a virus that converts other life forms into more Chimera &#x2568; has overrun Russia and all of Europe. Humanity&#x2552;s hope for survival is slim, and the tide of the battle rests on the shoulders of U.S. Army Ranger, Sgt. Nathan Hale.The Chimera didn't plan to take this protracted war lying down, however, and amassed their forces in Russia. Once Russia was captured, they quickly erected a wall around the former country, rebuking all efforts at communication or contact. While the world waited and wondered what other terrors might spill from the wall, England prepares for and falls to a major Chimera invasion in 1951.The United States comes to aid their English allies, but all does not go as planned. The next three days will see some of the most intense fighting the war has known thus far, and it's up to you to end the Chimera threat before the plague of defeat can encircle the globe.Next-generation gameplay and styleThe gameplay of Resistance is classic First Person Shooter. Insomniac Games has combined its passion for creating exotic weapons and vehicles with a proprietary physics system to create unique human and alien weaponry. Many of the weapons of the game are era-appropriate, such as pistols and grenades. Other weapons, such as the Chimeran Auger, are of alien design. Due to the differences in the ways that the various weapons handle, great care must be taken when entering an area infested with Chimera with their own weaponry. In addition to the obvious array of weapons, players can use melee attacks and jump to avoid attack.Special game actions, called \"Skill Tasks,\" are worth set number of points that can be spent to unlock new content in the game. A Skill Task may be something as simple as killing a number of enemies in a short period of time or as involved as locating a hidden area in the single player campaign. The mystery of the tasks, however, is that they aren't actually revealed until you have completed the task. This makes for a great reply incentive, as you will be mowing down Chimera and be suddenly rewarded with task points, often when you least expect the reward.Obviously, presentation is one of the areas in which Resistance shines. The frame rate is silky-smooth, and never seems to get bogged down when there is a large number of Chimera or teammates on screen. Animations are believable, the locations are detailed, and the voice acting is top-notch. Explosions are especially impressive, sending shrapnel and smoke in all directions. If you're looking for a game to impress your friends with graphically, look no further. Resistance is the type of game that makes you feel confident about the future of the PLAYSTATION 3.Track stats and more onlineResistance also boasts an impressive 40 player online multiplayer mode. It's not uncommon to find large-scale battles with both intricate strategy and simple \"run and gun\" play styles.

She has spent the past 100 years in the Everneath, a world where immortals, called the Everliving, go to replenish their strength by feeding on the energy of humans. Nikki, anchored by the memory of her boyfriend Jack, miraculously survived the feed. Now she has six final months at home to say her good-byes before returning to the Tunnels, a hellish extension of the Everneath. Combining elements of the Persephone myth and the tale of Orpheus and Eurydice, the story alternates between the events that led Nikki to agree to the feed and her return. As the only person ever to survive, she is urged by Cole, the Everliving who initially took her away, to seize control of the Everneath (with him, of course). Will she?

        "0060598964": "In this unique biography of Thomas Jefferson, leading journalist and social critic Christopher Hitchens offers a startlingly new and provocative interpretation of our Founding Father. Situating Jefferson within the context of America's evolution and tracing his legacy over the past two hundred years, Hitchens brings the character of Jefferson to life as a man of his time and also as a symbolic figure beyond it.Conflicted by power, Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence and acted as Minister to France yet yearned for a quieter career in the Virginia legislature. Predicting that slavery would shape the future of America's development, this professed proponent of emancipation elided the issue in the Declaration and continued to own human property. An eloquent writer, he was an awkward public speaker; a reluctant candidate, he left an indelible presidential legacy.Jefferson's statesmanship enabled him to negotiate the Louisiana Purchase with France, doubling the size of the nation, and he authorized the Lewis and Clark expedition, opening up the American frontier for exploration and settlement. Hitchens also analyzes Jefferson's handling of the Barbary War, a lesser-known chapter of his political career, when his attempt to end the kidnapping and bribery of Americans by the Barbary states, and the subsequent war with Tripoli, led to the building of the U.S. navy and the fortification of America's reputation regarding national defense.In the background of this sophisticated analysis is a large historical drama: the fledgling nation's struggle for independence, formed in the crucible of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment, and, in its shadow, the deformation of that struggle in the excesses of the French Revolution. This artful portrait of a formative figure and a turbulent era poses a challenge to anyone interested in American history -- or in the ambiguities of human nature.Discover More Eminent LivesFrancis Crick: Discoverer of the Genetic Codeby Matt RidleyFreud: Inventor of the Modern Mindby Peter KramerMachiavelli: Philosopher of Powerby Ross KingMuhammad: A Prophet for Our Timeby Karen ArmstrongGeorge Washington: The Founding Fatherby Paul JohnsonAlexis de Tocqueville: Democracy's Guideby Joseph Epstein",
        "B00030GS80": "There's always been a certain magic to Zelda games. The classic formula should have gotten old by now, but it hasn't. Perhaps it's because we all identify on some level with this shy, unlikely hero. Maybe the games remind us of our own childhood. Or perhaps these titles are consistently of such high quality that we can't help but love them. Regardless, The Minish Cap succeeds in all these ways &#x96; simultaneously embracing its links to the past while offering numerous innovations that keep gameplay fresh, exciting, and a true joy to&#xA0;play.The greatest of these novel concepts is the ability to transform from normal size down to the diminutive form of the Minish, a race of tiny people living right under the noses of the humans. This opens up entirely new realms of gameplay, as puzzles and even combat must be accomplished in different ways. When miniaturized, the smallest puddle becomes a deep lake, and the most mundane creatures become monstrous foes.There's a new item called the Gust Jar that allows you to suck up obstacles and enemies before blowing them back out in a burst of air. It's one of the cooler new power-up items I've encountered in any of the Zelda games, and adds yet another level of complexity to how you play. Another new ability allows Link to double himself, creating a ghostly after-image that mirrors his moves for a brief time. As you might imagine, this results in some clever and unique brainteasers that are a nod to the recent Four Swords games. In all these ways, the game challenges you to think in multiple dimensions and carefully remember details on your journey. A large cast of characters fleshes out the land of Hyrule, and monsters both large and small await your blade. To further connect you to the world's people, you will now collect items called Kinstones &#x96; broken halves of coin-like objects that can be fused with the Kinstones that other characters in the world have collected. By doing so, you'll open up portals, treasure chests, and secret doors all over the map. It's an addictive side quest that serves as a worthy compliment to the main adventure.One of my few complaints is that while the puzzles in the game are uniformly challenging, some of the combat is easier than I might have liked, especially against the bosses, who were often one-trick ponies requiring minimal skill. Even so, the fights are satisfying in their simplicity, and you have access to all the familiar weapons and techniques, including the boomerang, spin attack, and bow. The old and new features combine to make a game that feels both true to the Zelda heritage while offering an entirely unique experience.But more than any of this, the game charms you with its stalwart hero. This silent little boy with ruffled, messy hair is faced with seemingly insurmountable odds. Through him, the game establishes a hero whose pure heart and will are carrying him forward. All the elements of The Minish Cap (even its presence on the GBA) contribute to the idea of a tiny force for good that strives to triumph against a huge evil. It's a classic adventure that more than lives up to the legacy of a classic series.Concept:The time-honored Zelda tale retold in yet another new formGraphics:Mixing the familiar images of previous Zelda games with humorous and detailed new character designs results in an impressive success for the GBASound:Some of the most memorable and recognizable tunes in gaming sound great even on those little GBA speakersPlayability:Responsive and flexible with a nearly perfect learning curve that moves from simple to challengingEntertainment:Like many of its predecessors &#x96; a true classicReplay:ModerateRated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Matt MillerIssue:February 20052nd Opinion:There's a bird sitting on my head, I'm no larger than a toenail clipping, and I've been stuck on the same puzzle for the last three hours. Long story short, I'm having the time of my life. For any of you who played the remarkable Super Nintendo title A Link to the Past, The Minish Cap will bring a tear to your eye. This is classic Zelda gameplay in all its glory. The journey is a tad easy for my liking (boss fights are a breeze), but I can't get enough of the creative puzzles and new gadgets. Shrinking in height to a two-pixel speck is not only hilarious, it's one of the most compelling concepts that the series has offered up in a long time. Minigames are also in great abundance, and you can collect over 130 different figurines that shed some light on the characters in the world (which also happens to be one of my favorite aspects of Wind Waker). From its stunning visuals to its gameplay finesse, The Minish Cap is another harrowing Hyrule adventure that you'll remember for a lifetime.Rated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer",
        "0062109847": "The latest Jack Swyteck legal thriller begins with a controversial not-guilty verdict, a violent act that leaves a young woman in a coma, and accusations of corruption leveled at Jack himself. His client, a woman accused of murdering her daughter because the girl impinged on her carefree lifestyle, is acquitted, but Jack knows there&#x2019;s a lot more to the case than he&#x2019;s been allowed to reveal in court. And after a woman who looks startlingly like his client is beaten nearly to death, Jack discovers that this was no weirdly coincidental act of violence but rather a result of something hidden behind the media spectacle surrounding the trial. After a few lethargic Swyteck novels, the author charged back in 2011 with Afraid of the Dark, and this one is similarly energetic, with a story that&#x2019;s full of twists and turns and, not incidentally, some well-aimed criticisms of the way high-profile trials are covered by the news media.

Sophie Honeywell hasn't heard from ex-boyfriend Thomas Gordon since she broke his heart three years ago. He's since married and fathered a child, while Sophie remains single, pining for a baby. When Thomas's Aunt Connie leaves her house on Scribbly Gum Island to Sophie, the family is largely nonplussed&mdash;but then, they're used to mysteries. The famous 1932 discovery of baby Enigma by Connie and her sister, Rose Doughty, led to the successful \"Munro Baby Mystery\" tour that kept the sisters afloat for years. Among the large, eccentric family, Sophie starts a new life, befriending Thomas's cousin Grace, who is suffering through postpartum depression; finding a dangerous mutual attraction with Grace's husband, Callum; and dealing with bitter, intense Veronika, Thomas's sister, who covets Connie's house. Moriarty expertly handles a large cast and their relationships, keeping everyone guessing as the true story of baby Enigma&mdash;and its role in Sophie's strange inheritance&mdash;is slowly revealed.

        "006019491X": "Oprah Book Club&#174; Selection, February 2000:Until Isabel Allende burst onto the scene with her 1985 debut,The House of the Spirits, Latin American fiction was, for the most part, a boys' club comprising such heavy hitters as Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez, Jorge Luis Borges, and Mario Vargas Llosa.  But the Chilean Allende shouldered her way in with her magical realist multi-generational tale of the Trueba family, followed it up with four more novels and a spate of nonfiction, and has remained in a place of honor ever since. Her sixth work of fiction,Daughter of Fortune, shares some characteristics with her earlier works: the canvas is wide, the characters are multi-generational and multi-ethnic, and the protagonist is an unconventional woman who overcomes enormous obstacles to make her way in the world. Yet one cannot accuse Allende of telling the same story twice; set in the mid-1800s, this novel follows the fortunes of Eliza Sommers, Chilean by birth but adopted by a British spinster, Rose Sommers, and her bachelor brother, Jeremy, after she is abandoned on their doorstep.\"You have English blood, like us,\" Miss Rose assured Eliza when she was old enough to understand. \"Only someone from the British colony would have thought to leave you in a basket on the doorstep of the British Import and Export Company, Limited. I am sure they knew how good-hearted my brother Jeremy is, and felt sure he would take you in. In those days I was longing to have a child, and you fell into my arms, sent by God to be brought up in the solid principles of the Protestant faith and the English language.\"The family servant, Mama Fresia, has a different point of view, however: \"You, English? Don't get any ideas, child. You have Indian hair, like mine.\" And certainly Eliza's almost mystical ability to recall all the events of her life would seem to stem more from the Indian than the Protestant side.As Eliza grows up, she becomes less tractable, and when she falls in love with Joachin Andieta, a clerk in Jeremy's firm, her adoptive family is horrified. They are even more so when a now-pregnant Eliza follows her lover to California where he has gone to make his fortune in the 1849 gold rush. Along the way Eliza meets Tao Chi'en, a Chinese doctor who saves her life and becomes her closest friend. What starts out as a search for a lost love becomes, over time, the discovery of self; and by the time Eliza finally catches up with the elusive Joachin, she is no longer sure she still wants what she once wished for.  Allende peoples her novel with a host of colorful secondary characters. She even takes the narrative as far afield as China, providing an intimate portrait of Tao Chi'en's past before returning to 19th-century San Francisco, where he and Eliza eventually fetch up. Readers with a taste for the epic, the picaresque, and romance that is satisfyingly complex will find them all inDaughter of Fortune.--Margaret Prior",

        "0099526832": "David Lurie is hardly the hero of his own life, or anyone else's. At 52, the protagonist ofDisgraceis at the end of his professional and romantic game, and seems to be deliberately courting disaster. Long a professor of modern languages at Cape Town University College, he has recently been relegated to adjunct professor of communications at the same institution, now pointedly renamed Cape Technical University:Although he devotes hours of each day to his new discipline, he finds its first premise, as enunciated in the Communications 101 handbook, preposterous: \"Human society has created language in order that we may communicate our thoughts, feelings and intentions to each other.\" His own opinion, which he does not air, is that the origins of speech lie in song, and the origins of song in the need to fill out with sound the overlarge and rather empty human soul.Twice married and twice divorced, his magnetic looks on the wane, David rather cruelly seduces one of his students, and his conduct unbecoming is soon uncovered. In his eighth novel, J.M. Coetzee might have been content to write a searching academic satire. But inDisgracehe is intent on much more, and his art is as uncompromising as his main character, though infinitely more complex. Refusing to play the public-repentance game, David gets himself fired--a final gesture of contempt. Now, he thinks, he will write something on Byron's last years. Not empty, unread criticism, \"prose measured by the yard,\" but a libretto. To do so, he heads for the Eastern Cape and his daughter's farm. In her mid-20s, Lucy has turned her back on city sophistications: with five hectares, she makes her living by growing flowers and produce and boarding dogs. \"Nothing,\" David thinks, \"could be more simple.\" But nothing, in fact, is more complicated--or, in the new South Africa, more dangerous. Far from being the refuge he has sought, little is safe in Salem. Just as David has settled into his temporary role as farmworker and unenthusiastic animal-shelter volunteer, he and Lucy are attacked by three black men. Unable to protect his daughter, David's disgrace is complete. Hers, however, is far worse.There is much more to be explored in Coetzee's painful novel, and few consolations. It would be easy to pick up on his title and viewDisgraceas a complicated working-out of personal and political shame and responsibility. But the author is concerned with his country's history, brutalities, and betrayals. Coetzee is also intent on what measure of soul and rights we allow animals. After the attack, David takes his role at the shelter more seriously, at last achieving an unlikely home and some measure of love. In Coetzee's recent Princeton lectures,The Lives of Animals, an aging novelist tells her audience that the question that occupies all lab and zoo creatures is, \"Where is home, and how do I get there?\" David, though still all-powerful compared to those he helps dispose of, is equally trapped, equally lost.Disgraceis almost willfully plain. Yet it possesses its own lean, heartbreaking lyricism, most of all in its descriptions of unwanted animals. At the start of the novel, David tells his student that poetry either speaks instantly to the reader--\"a flash of revelation and a flash of response\"--or not at all. Coetzee's book speaks differently, its layers and sadnesses endlessly unfolding.--Kerry Fried--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

Origin began as a secret military project run by the Aramacham Technology Corporation (ATC) . In an experiment run by Alma's own father, her DNA was used to create two clones that possessed her impressive psychic powers in an attempt to engineer a telepathic military commander. In the end, the research team became worried about the dangers of Alma's powers, and they tried to kill her.While her heart stopped beating and her physical body died, her psychic energy continued to exist, and she manifested herself in many forms, including both a child and a deformed adult figure that betrays the gruesomeness of her ordeal. Due to a string of events tied to both her clones, Alma has escaped the disastrous explosion of the last game and the facility where she was held, and the haunting manifestations of her power are at work all around you, adding an unpredictable, nightmarish quality to the world.Strange Events in a Supernatural SettingIn order to get anywhere in the rubble of the city of Auburn, you'll need to survive firefights, stay calm in the face of surprisingly graphic events, and uncover the terrifying and mysterious nature of your real enemies. Your character's phenomenal reflexes allow the much-talked-about slow motion effect from the original title to persist here, giving you an edge in combat and adding to the unique nature of your perspective.Improved Details and Enemy AIAn enhanced graphics engine means more detailed environments to explore and better effects. The vast destruction in the city opens up a huge variety of spaces and enhances the other-worldly feel of your mission, and you better be ready to stay on guard because all-new enemies powered by improved AI don't just act more realistically than their predecessors, they employ advanced combat tactics and know how to use the environment against you. But they aren't the only ones with more resources at their disposal--additional world interaction enhancements allow you to create cover and protect yourself or remove obstacles from your path.While it may be the horrific action and the details that first catch your eye, the tactical demands and the way story elements are slowly unveiled promise to help keep you interested as gameplay wears on. And for those times when you're not in the mood for a prolonged single-player campaign, this title also offers the ability to battle with or against friends in multiplayer mode.",

I know of no other spy thriller that so successfully blends the fascinating nuances of the business of espionage and intelligence work with full-throttle suspense storytelling.&rdquo; --Jeffery DeaverAmazon Exclusive: Jeffrey Deaver Interviews Matthew DunnJeffrey Deaver:Matthew, why did you choose to write under your own name and not a pseudonym? Isn&rsquo;t that what most people who&rsquo;ve written about espionage work have done? Are there risks to using your own name?Matthew Dunn:When I was a spy I always operated under completely different identities. At the beginning of every mission, I felt like an actor taking to the stage on the first night. Though an actor can take off his or her costume at the end of the night, often I could not do so for months and in some cases years. I decided to write under my own name for three reasons: First, I wanted to do something that had my real name attached to my work. Second, I felt my readers deserved to know who I really am. And third, I felt it would be cowardly to hide behind another name since I am no longer a spy. Yes, there are severe and immediate risks, and I&rsquo;m conscious of them every day. But I&rsquo;ve chosen those risks. If a team comes for me, I&rsquo;ll deal with it.JD:What kind of man or woman makes an ideal field officer&mdash;one who runs agents?MD:There are many quantifiable traits &ndash; intellect, skills in lateral thinking, a gregarious personality (deployed in exact moments), an unwavering belief that anything is possible, the ability to manipulate, ruthlessness, compassion, leadership, the ability to make rifle-shot decisions, and tremendous courage. But ultimately MI6, the CIA, the French DGSE, the Russian SVR (the successor to the KGB) and Mossad &ndash; that is, the truly &ldquo;global&rdquo; intelligence services &ndash; recruit a particular breed of animal to work as an agent, and one knows that animal when one sees her or him.  That person is simply different from everyone else. If you are a good field officer, your agent (i.e. the foreign national you&rsquo;ve recruited to spy on his country) will trust you with his life. He won&rsquo;t risk execution by working for just MI6 or whatever institution you represent &ndash; he&rsquo;ll do it for you.JD:How autonomous does a field officer have to be? And is operating solo an advantage in the world of intelligence and espionage?MD:Intelligence officers are lone wolves. It&rsquo;s vital that they don&rsquo;t make themselves visible.  One can&rsquo;t get the best intelligence by using a sledgehammer approach. To that extent, there are no &ldquo;superior forces or big guns&rdquo; when you&rsquo;re in the field. Your country&rsquo;s army, navy, and air force are the inferior forces that are liable to get it wrong. And that means you can&rsquo;t trust or use them. But if you mess up and get caught, you will die.JD:Can you describe the operation for which you were awarded an unusual, special commendation by the British government?MD:I can, but I won&rsquo;t.JD:Good call. If you had answered, maybeI'dhave found one of those red laser dots on my forehead&hellip; If there's one vital lesson to be learned in foreign intelligence training, what is it?MD:Mind-set is key. An MI6 officer believes that he or she can achieve anything and very often that self-belief is justified. MI6 is far and away the best intelligence organization at encouraging that outlook. As a result, and based on what it has achieved, it is without doubt the best intelligence organization in the world.JD:What do you mean when you say, &ldquo;When a gun comes out on a deep-cover mission, it&rsquo;s the worst thing that can happen?&rdquo; Talk a bit about the physical aspects of espionage.MD:Officers are typically trained to use guns in tight, urban situations, to deploy highly aggressive and effective unarmed military combat techniques, and to do whatever is necessary to get out of a situation. But the primary role of a spy is to collect intelligence. When guns are deployed &ndash; certain direct actions excluded &ndash; something has gone wrong. Even when things have gone wrong, many good spies would prefer to die and maintain the integrity of the operation than to pull a weapon. No good intelligence comes out of a fight or torture; these actions only result in the pleadings of a man who wants to live. Morality aside, the CIA&rsquo;s use of water boarding made men say anything to keep from drowning. Saying anything, or even providing &ldquo;good information,&rdquo; is a million miles away from providing intelligence, (i.e. something that is most certainly not public knowledge). For that reason and to their peril, the British learned that torture was ineffective in the Boer War. Guns and torture are anathema to intelligence-gathering activities, but they are also bedfellows.JD:Is it hard for retiring foreign-service officers to adapt to private life?MD:Most people who leave are achievers. They get jobs in the top ranks of industry, commerce, government, or maybe some place similar in the arts. But all of us struggle. We are trained to believe that we are better than everyone else when the reality is that we are not. We&rsquo;ve simply seen different, odd things and had to do a job that requires inordinate self-belief. It&rsquo;s taken me ten years to adjust to not being a spy. I&rsquo;m still adjusting.JD:What about the service do you miss?MD:I miss the friendships I had with my foreign agents. They would do the most unbelievably brave things for me, but would always be aware of the danger they were in and their own mortality. I respected them and loved them more than MI6 or anyone else, and that is how it is supposed to be. My agents were my family. We laughed together in one-on-one meetings in swanky hotels and war-zone ditches. We cried together. I held their hands and told them to be brave. I watched the fear and defiance in their eyes as they went back to their tasks. But I was never Matthew Dunn. I was someone else even if the emotion was real. I miss my agents, but they don&rsquo;t miss me because they never knew who I was. I regret that more than anything.",

        "0060548940": "&ldquo;Elphaba&rsquo;s Heirs and Assigns&rdquo; by Gregory MaguireDepending on how you count the years, I am about at my 25th anniversary of the original inspiration forWicked. I was on a walk on a country road in Massachusetts, thinking myopically and somewhat self-regardingly about various offenses that I felt had been perpetrated against me. I was wondering about how apparently trustworthy people could turn dangerous, or if they really had been dangerous all along, merely well-disguised, even from themselves? A standard issue college dorm question, I suppose, but the matter seemed urgent to me that year. I moved from the slightly sore subject of my personal life into the realm of imagination to keep the question alive without it hurting so much, and almost immediately I thought of the Wicked Witch of the West--admittedly, more Margaret Hamilton than L. Frank Baum--and I wondered: Was she always terrible?The momentary crisis of that year, combined with attention to acts of evil and distress in our larger world a few years later, brought me into Oz and the world ofWicked. Still, even eight years later whenWickedwas first published, I hadn't expected that the story would remain a presence in the world. I had an imagination big enough to see into every cranny of Oz, but not big enough to imagine that anyone else might get interested, and stay interested.After the story of Elphaba hit the bookstores, the national bestseller lists, the book clubs, and then the Broadway stage, the increasing attention to the story prompted me to go back and follow up the clues I had liberally sprinkled in the first book.Son of a Witchposited that Elphaba and Fiyero had an illegitimate boy, and considered the troubles he would have first growing up with the Witch as a negligent mother and then, even worse, with his negligent mother gone from his life.A Lion Among Menfollowed up with the Cowardly Lion's tale. Why the Lion and not the Tin Woodman or the Scarecrow, readers ask me. For a number of reasons, but chief among them is that the Lion is an Animal, and Elphaba's concern for the flight of talking Animals makes his life story more urgent to the themes of the Wicked Years sequence.So finally we come toOut of Oz, the fourth and I believe final book in the series. I feel both elated and elegiac to be bringing it to readers. I get to revisit characters I love--Glinda, under house arrest; the Cowardly Lion, on the run from the law; Liir, the Witch's boy; and a little girl growing up in the shadows who may be pivotal to the resolution of military and social struggle in Oz.Oh, and yes--Dorothy too. Dorothy Gale. That Dorothy. She comes on for something more than a curtain call. Face it: you always knew Dorothy was too strong a force to stay buckled down on the Kansas prairie, didn't you? No earthly gravity can hold that girl in one place for long: she defies gravity, too, only without the broomstick.Come for a visit and stay a while.

Rutledge doesn&#x2019;t believe Russell for a moment, and a lunch meeting with the dying man does nothing to change his mind. Armed with just a few leads, Rutledge journeys to an obscure corner of Essex, where the locals receive him with equal parts loathing and fear. The cold case becomes even more chilling when Russell is fatally shot. Rutledge continues to probe, as a singular question consumes his thoughts. Why would Russell confess to a crime he didn&#x2019;t commit?

        "0062240501": "*Starred Review* Robinson&#x2019;s long-running and best-selling Inspector Banks series, now spanning more than 20 novels, has won a clutch of awards, including France&#x2019;s Grand Prix de Litt&#xE9;rature Polici&#xE8;re and Sweden&#x2019;s Martin Beck awards, along with nominations for Edgar and Agatha awards. Detective Chief Inspector Banks, the artsy and melancholic Yorkshire detective, and his snarky sidekick, Detective Inspector Annie Cabbot, are consistently fun to watch, whether you just drop in on this series or have seen the shifts in their relationship from the beginning. Robinson writes police procedurals in which the latest forensic science enhances, while still taking a back seat to, the basic arts of detection; Banks is clearly on the side of old-fashioned discovery of motive and opportunity, and his questioning of suspects is wonderful to witness. This time the body of a former university lecturer is found on the tracks of an abandoned railroad track in North Yorkshire. The man has been living hand to mouth since his dismissal on charges of sexual misconduct several years before. The scene reads as a suicide, except to Banks, who suspects that the 5,000 pounds left in the man&#x2019;s pocket and his recent reaching out to militant college contacts from the 1970s may point to a more complicated story. As usual with a Banks novel, the chief inspector&#x2019;s frictions with higher-ups are nearly as gripping as the unraveling of the case itself. First-rate procedural and character study.      HIGH-DEMAND BACKSTORY: An A-list staple, Robinson&#x2019;s Inspector Banks series has a devoted following, especially in libraries, and this is one of the series&#x2019; highlights. --Connie Fletcher",

Noted medievalist Norman Cantor tells the story of the pandemic and its widespread effects inIn the Wake of the Plague.After giving an overview, Cantor describes various theories about the medical crisis, from contemporary fears of a Jewish conspiracy to poison the water (and the resulting atrocities against European Jews) to a growing belief among modern historians that both bubonic plague and anthrax caused the spiraling death rates. Cantor also details ways in which the Black Death changed history, at both the personal level (family lines dying out) and the political (the Plantagenet kings may well have been able to hold onto France had their resources not been so diminished).Cantor veers from topic to topic, from dynastic worries to the Dance of Death, and from peasants' rights to Perpendicular Gothic. This makes for amusing reading, though those seeking an orderly narrative may be frustrated. He also seems overly concerned with rumors of homosexual behavior, and his attempt to link the savage method of Edward II's murder to a cooling in global weather is a bit farfetched.Cantor wears his considerable scholarship lightly, but includes a very useful critical biography for further reading.

The author is off to a good start with the tale of how Vivi, Teensy, Caro and Necie met as little girls in 1930, their spunk and liveliness a harbinger of things to come. But the focus on the Ya-Yas' early years soon wavers and the novel is all over the map&mdash;here a few tales about the grown-up Ya-Yas, like Vivi's run-in with her son's first-grade teacher, a pompous nun; there a story about Vivi's eldest daughter, Sidda, one of the so-called \"Petites Ya-Yas,\" and her directorial debut at age eight at a Valentine's Day party. A chapter appears out of nowhere from the viewpoint of Myrtis Spevey, a contemporary of the original Ya-Yas, who is so excessively jealous and resentful of the friends that she comes off as a cartoon character. After a vexing 30-year leap, Myrtis's creepy, emotionally ill daughter, Edythe, takes over the narrative, kidnapping one of the Ya-Yas' grandchildren. What begins as a collection of haphazard but entertaining snippets from the Ya-Yas' lives suddenly bumps up against a sober story about a missing child and the lengths to which parents will go to protect their young. Readers may lose patience as even the loose family-album format fails to hold up, but Wells still charms when she focuses on the redemptive power of family love and the special bond that comes from genuine, long-lived friendship.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

And in San Francisco, a large earthquake occurred just after five in the morning on April 18--and that was just the beginning. The quake caused a conflagration that raged for the next three days, destroying much of the American West's greatest city. The fire, along with water damage and other indirect acts, proved more destructive than the earthquake itself, but insurance companies tried hard to dispute this fact since few people carried earthquake insurance. It was also the world's first major natural disaster to have been extensively photographed and covered by the media, and as a result, it left \"an indelible imprint on the mind of the entire nation.\"Though the epicenter of this marvelously constructed book is San Francisco, Winchester covers much more than just the disaster. He discusses how this particular quake led to greater scientific study of quakes in an attempt to understand the movements of the earth. Trained at Oxford University as a geologist, Winchester is well qualified to discuss the subject, and he clearly explains plate tectonics theory (first introduced in 1968) and the creation of the San Andreas Fault, along with the geologic exploration of the American West in the late 19th century and the evolution of technology used to measure and predict earthquakes. He also covers the social and political shifts caused by the disaster, such as the way that Pentecostalists viewed the quake as \"a message of divine approval\" and used it to recruit new members into the church, and the rise in the local Chinese population. With many records destroyed in the fire, there was no way to distinguish between legal and illegal immigrants, and thus many more Chinese were granted citizenship than would have otherwise been.

Told from the point of view of Tinkerbell, listeners live the story of Tiger Lily, daughter of cross-dressing shaman Tik Tok, and her role as wild girl in Neverland. When her arranged marriage to Giant looms closer, Tiger Lily defies her elders and discovers the burrow where Peter Pan and the Lost Boys live. As Tiger Lily spends more time with Peter than with her tribe, she begins to lose sight of a major dilemma facing her village: Englishman Philip forcing his beliefs on the &#x201C;savages.&#x201D; While the main focus of the story is the budding romance between the wild girl and the boy who never grew up, all the familiar characters from Neverland are given a new twist: Smee is more feared than Hook, Tinkerbell is not attached to Peter, and the boys are more like teenagers. Expertly narrated by Cassandra Morris, Tink's voice is captured effortlessly as she follows Tiger Lily around Neverland. Note that there are drinking references an dmild innuendos. Fans of the original Peter Pan (Barrie, 1911) and the acclaimed &#x201C;Peter and the Star Catchers&#x201D; series (Barry/Pearson 2006) will fall in love with Tiger Lily.&#x2013;Amanda Schiavulli Finger Lakes Library System, NY&#x3B1;(c) Copyright 2013.

        "B00006IR62": "Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship",

What she never counted on was discovering her fianc&eacute;, A.J. Jernigan, cavorting with her maid of honor in the middle of her rehearsal dinner. She pitches a hissy fit that reverberates through her tiny hometown of Madison, Ga., and captures the attention of Will Mahoney, a newcomer who recently purchased an antebellum plantation house. Headstrong, freckled Will pressures Keeley to restore the rundown mansion within six months. His plan: to woo a woman whom he has seen only on television by designing the house of her dreams by Christmas. Keeley knows it's an insane plan, but the Jernigans are now trying to put her out of business, so she begrudgingly accepts. As the house comes together, Keeley discovers links between the Jernigan legacy of infidelity and her mother's disappearance many years ago.

And Keeley's vast knowledge of all things antique offers a fascinating peek into the luscious world of designer home furnishing, sure to make readers drool with envy over sideboards and sofas.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0060898771": "Book DescriptionTerrorist attacks. Natural disasters. Domestic crackdowns. Economic collapse. Riots. Wars. Disease. Starvation.What can you do when it all hits the fan?You can learn to be self-sufficient and survive without the system.**I've started to look at the world through apocalypse eyes.** So begins Neil Strauss's harrowing new book: his first full-length worksince the international bestsellerThe Game, and one of the most original-and provocative-narratives of the year.After the last few years of violence and terror, of ethnic and religious hatred, of tsunamis and hurricanes&ndash;and now of world financial meltdown&ndash;Strauss, like most of his generation, came to the sobering realization that, even in America, anything can happen. But rather than watch helplessly, he decided to do something about it. And so he spent three years traveling through a country that's lost its sense of safety, equipping himself with the tools necessary to save himself and his loved ones from an uncertain future.With the same quick wit and eye for cultural trends that markedThe Game, The Dirt,andHow to Make Love Like a Porn Star, Emergencytraces Neil's white-knuckled journey through today's heart of darkness, as he sets out to move his life offshore, test his skills in the wild, and remake himself as a gun-toting, plane-flying, government-defying survivor. It's a tale of paranoid fantasies and crippling doubts, of shady lawyers and dangerous cult leaders, of billionaire gun nuts and survivalist superheroes, of weirdos, heroes, and ordinary citizens going off the grid.It's one man's story of a dangerous world&ndash;and how to stay alive in it.Before the next disaster strikes, you're going to want to read this book. And you'll want to do everything it suggests. Because tomorrow doesn't come with a guarantee...Questions for Neil StraussAmazon.com:What initially inspired you to writeEmergency?Strauss:It happened over the last eight years, watching as everything that we thought could never happen in America suddenly started happening. So I decided to take control over my own life, rather than being dependent on an increasingly undependable system, and worked toward becoming as self-sufficient, independent, skilled, and experienced as I could. That journey continues today.Amazon.com:You use the term \"Fliesian\" in the book (as inLord of the Flies). What is a Fliesian?Strauss:Someone who believes that people, if put in a world where there are no consequences to their actions, will do horrible things.Amazon.com:So how can we hold on to our kindness and humaneness in a crisis?Strauss:Fortunately, in my experience, it is precisely these situations when you see the best in people come out. The worst in some tends to arise only when the resources one needs to survive are scarce and there is competition for them.Amazon.com:Do you think that this book is catering to a fear-based culture?Strauss:Actually, the book is less about spreading fears than getting over them. What most of us fear is the unknown, and we fret about what&#x2019;s going to happen in an uncertain future when we consider the calamities of the past. I decided to no longer react to the things I read in newspapers, but instead to understand them. So I took each worst-case scenario to the extreme, and experienced many of the things that used to make me anxious. I guess, in that way, it was like a more interesting, adventurous Prozac.Amazon.com:A lot of writers these days are basing books on various year-long stunts: read the encyclopedia for a year, always say \"yes\" for a year, have sex with your wife every day for a year. But your brand of immersion journalism, inEmergencyand inThe Game, is more open-ended--and more personal--than that. Do you draw any sort of line between the books and your life?Strauss:My books never begin as books. They usually begin as some sort of lack I recognize in my life and try to fix with the help of the most qualified experts I can find. Often, these people are not in the public eye, but hidden in a splinter subculture. And while I&#x2019;m trying to get taken under their wing, I realize at some point I&#x2019;m spending so much time trying to learn and improve that I might as well have something to show for it, so I write a book.Amazon.com:One of the first subcultures you embedded yourself in was a cabal of billionaires. Are wealthy people safer than the rest of us?Strauss:No, they&#x2019;re more scared than the rest of us. That&#x2019;s why they&#x2019;re taking so many precautionary measures. They are defined by their money, and now that identity is crumbling around them. You can&#x2019;t buy safety. Those who are the most safe are the ones with knowledge, skills, and experience.Amazon.com:You describe the philosophy of the sphincter inEmergency. What is that?Strauss:I learned that from one of my defense instructors. The basic idea is that, in a high-pressure situation, the first thing that happens is people get nervous and uptight. And as soon as your sphincter tightens, as the metaphor goes, it cuts off circulation to your brain. So one of the best survival skills you can have is the ability to quickly and coolly assess a situation rather than panicking and doing something stupid.Amazon.com:From your wilderness survival training, it sounds like you're in pretty good shape if things ever hit the fan. But what if you live in the city?Strauss:That&#x2019;s a good point. A lot of the wilderness survival skills I learned don&#x2019;t take into account that, in America today, there&#x2019;s little actual wilderness left. So I took a class called Urban Escape and Evasion. As the teacher put it, &#x201C;Once you learn lockpicking, the world is your oyster.&#x201D; He also taught car hot-wiring, evading pursuit vehicles, and, as an exam, handcuffed me, put me in a trunk, and told me I had to escape. It was one of the most interesting classes I&#x2019;d taken in my life. If I&#x2019;d known these skills in high school, I definitely would have been expelled.Amazon.com:The book has a surprising trajectory--surprising to the reader and I think to you as well. You start out looking for a way to get out of Dodge if one of many possible disasters strikes, but as you develop your survival skills, instead of becoming a lone wolf in the woods, you start becoming tied to your community, as an EMT and a trained crisis management worker (not to mention a goat midwife). It's actually pretty heartwarming. Did you see any of that coming?Strauss:Definitely not. I had no idea that when disasters happen now, instead of running away from them, I&#x2019;d be running toward them and trying to be of some use to the community. I think that, if there&#x2019;s a silver lining in the dark cloud that is the economy right now, it&#x2019;s that hard times bring people closer together. Now is the time to get to know your neighbors. You never know when you may need them.Amazon.com:Has your experience writingEmergencyaffected you differently from your experience writingThe Game?Strauss:Yes, because now, at 3 a.m. on a Saturday night, my search-and-rescue pager will go off and I&#x2019;ll have to stop doing what I learned inThe Gameand start doing what I learned inEmergency.",

        "0061766720": "AmazonBest of the Month, June 2009:The story itself could take your breath away: an 11-year-old boy, the only survivor of a small-plane crash in the San Gabriel Mountains in 1979, makes his way to safety down an icy mountain face in a blizzard, using the skills and determination he learned from his father. But it's the way that Norman Ollestad tells his tale that makesCrazy for the Storma memoir that will last. He almost has too much to tell: a way-larger-than-life father--former child actor, FBI man (who took on Hoover in acontroversial book), and surfer who drove his son to test his limits in the surf and on the slopes; a youth spent in the short-lived counterculture paradise of Topanga Canyon; a stepfather who could give Tobias Wolff's a run for his money; and of course the crash. But writing 30 years later, Ollestad is wise and talented enough to focus his story on the essentials, cutting elegantly back and forth between a moment-by-moment account of the crash and his memories of the difficult but often idyllic year leading up to it. More than a story of survival, it's a time-tempered reckoning with what it means to be a father and a son. --Tom NissleyAmazon Exclusive Essay:It Starts With a Good Storyby Norman OllestadIt was time for my eight-year old son, Noah, to read before bed. \"Eh,\" he groaned. \"Reading is so boring. It sucks.\" He&rsquo;d been reciting this same mantra for months. I was resting beside him in his bed and I saw his whole life crumble--a slew of poor report cards and father-son arguments, ending in long term unemployment. \"What about Dr. Seuss?\" I reasoned. He glared at me with his brown eyes. \"It's okay,\" he mumbled. I opened the book he was reading for his class and handed it to him. He stared at it, mute. \"Noah,\" I said from my lowest register. He proceeded to read at a snail's pace and I pointed out that it would take him twice as long as usual to get through the required five pages. So he ran the words together, not even stopping at periods. I grabbed the book and told him we'd be reading all weekend to make up for his lack of cooperation. For months I coerced him like that, urging him past his lazy monotone, trying to get him to connect with the story. It was a long few months.When I was Noah's age I also disliked reading. I just wanted to hear the story without having to work for it. I had wished my dad could work the same kind of magic he did with surfing: he'd push me into the waves so that I could simply enjoy the ride, eliminating the most arduous, frustrating part of surfing--paddling for the wave.My father was always asking my mother, who was a grade-school teacher, why I wasn't a better reader. She advocated patience, and encouraged me by tirelessly pointing out things in each story that I might relate to. My father was killed when I was eleven, so he never got to witness my eventual love of reading.In order to help Noah find that love, I searched for a seminal moment in my past that had transformed me. There was no single thing. But during my reminiscences I flashed on Dad reading aloud my grandparents' monthly letters from Mexico. They had retired to Puerto Vallarta and their letters were filled with stories. Stories about an inland village where Grandpa went twice a week to buy ice for their fridge, to keep their food cold. Stories about helping a Mexican family after a hurricane hit Puerto Vallarta. Stories of secret waterfalls and secluded isthmuses that Grandpa and Grandma had discovered around Vallarta. And that&rsquo;s when it hit me--it was very simple: the essence of my love for reading really emanates from my love for stories.\"How about I tell you a story tonight,\" I whispered with great zeal to Noah. His eyes lit up and he smiled. \"What kind of story?\"\"Any kind,\" I said.\"A story about a magic skateboard would be cool,\" he suggested. As I spun the impromptu tale, he rolled onto his side and stared at me, totally focused. The following night I made a bargain with him: \"First read five pages, then I'll work up a story about whatever you want.\" Before I got myself nestled beside him, he was halfway through the first page. Progressively, Noah's topics became more elaborate, and soon he was giving me outlines for stories. Somewhere along the line his reading voice changed--he was gobbling up the sentences, his voice alive with inflection. He'd broken through. Noah was hooked on stories, like I got hooked on riding waves. Once he'd experienced the pleasure of going on that narrative ride, reading became second nature, like paddling for a wave. It all starts with a good story.Photographs fromCrazy For the Storm(Click to Enlarge)My first surfboard, Topanga Beach, 1968Mom, Dad, and Me, Topanga Beach, 1968Dad in St. Anton, Austria, Early 1970'sSt. Anton with DadMe, Ski racingSkiing with DadPuerto Vallarta, 1975Three generations of Normans, 1977",

        "0060628391": "When Richard Foster began writingCelebration of Disciplinemore than 20 years ago, an older writer gave him a bit of advice: \"Be sure that every chapter forces the reader into the next chapter.\" Foster took the advice to heart; as a result, his book presents one of the most compelling and readable visions of Christian spirituality published in the past few decades. After beginning with a simple observation--\"Superficiality is the curse of our age.... The desperate need today is not for a greater number of intelligent people, or gifted people, but for deep people\"--Foster's book moves to explain the disciplines people must cultivate in order to achieve spiritual depth. In succinct, urgent, and sometimes humorous chapters, Foster defines a broad range of classic spiritual disciplines in terms that are lucid without being too limiting and offers advice that's practical without being overly prescriptive. For instance, after describing meditation as a combination of \"intense intimacy and awful reverence,\" he settles into such down-to-earth topics as how to choose a place and a posture in which to meditate.Perhaps most interesting and useful is Foster's chapter on the controversial Christian discipline of submission. According to Foster, submission does not demand self-hatred or loss of identity. Instead, it simply means growing secure in the conviction that \"our happiness is not dependent on getting what we want\" but on the fulfillment that naturally flows from love of one's neighbors. Such wise and encouraging suggestions have helped many readers to discard the idea that discipline is an onerous duty and to move toward a liberating and simpler idea of discipline--whose defining character, as Foster never forgets, is joy.--Michael Joseph Gross",

As told by journalist Kashner (Sinatraland) and biographer Schoenberger (Dangerous Muse: The Life of Caroline Blackwood), the romance between the glittering Tinseltown diva and the sonorous, self-loathing Shakespearean reprises their co-starring movie roles: it has the passion ofCleopatra(the Vatican condemned their on-set adultery as erotic vagrancy), the riotous merriment ofThe Taming of the Shrew, the poisonous marital fights ofWho's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?and a cast of thousands of paparazzi and shrieking fans. The well-researched narrative&mdash;the authors make good use of Burton's engaging love letters and diary entries&mdash;offers juicy details of his epic alcoholism and her towering tantrums, and is fascinated with the jewelry pieces, like the Taj Mahal diamond that Taylor famously extracted from Burton as tribute or penance. But from the binges and bling emerges a revealing portrait of the magnetic qualities&mdash;her vulgar warmth, his soulful virility&mdash;that glued the couple together.

Eph, who is joined by Setrakian and a motley crew of fighters, must now find a way to stop the contagion and save his city--a city that includes his wife and son--before it is too late.The Strain: Chapter One\"Once upon a time,\" said Abraham Setrakian&rsquo;s grandmother, \"there was a giant.\"Young Abraham&rsquo;s eyes brightened, and immediately the cabbage borscht in the wooden bowl got tastier, or at least less garlicky. He was a pale boy, underweight and sickly. His grandmother, intent on fattening him, sat across from him while he ate his soup, entertaining him by spinning a yarn.Abubbeh meiseh, a \"grandmother&rsquo;s story.\" A fairy tale. A legend.\"He was the son of a Polish nobleman. And his name was Jusef Sardu. Master Sardu stood taller than any other man. Taller than any roof in the village. He had to bow deeply to enter any door. But his great height, it was a burden. A disease of birth, not a blessing. The young man suffered. His muscles lacked the strength to support his long, heavy bones. At times it was a struggle for him just to walk. He used a cane, a tall stick--taller than you--with a silver handle carved into the shape of a wolf&rsquo;s head, which was the family crest.\"\"Yes, Bubbeh?\" said Abraham, between spoonfuls.\"This was his lot in life, and it taught him humility, which is a rare thing indeed for a nobleman to possess. He had so much compassion-- for the poor, for the hardworking, for the sick. He was especially dear to the children of the village, and his great, deep pockets--the size of turnip sacks--bulged with trinkets and sweets. He had not much of a childhood himself, matching his father&rsquo;s height at the age of eight, and surpassing him by a head at age nine. His frailty and his great size were a secret source of shame to his father. But Master Sardu truly was a gentle giant, and much beloved by his people. It was said of him that Master Sardu looked down on everyone, yet looked down on no one.\"She nodded at him, reminding him to take another spoonful. He chewed a boiled red beet, known as a \"baby heart\" because of its color, its shape, its capillary-like strings. \"Yes, Bubbeh?\"\"He was also a lover of nature, and had no interest in the brutality of the hunt--but, as a nobleman and a man of rank, at the age of fifteen his father and his uncles prevailed upon him to accompany them on a six-week expedition to Romania.\"\"To here, Bubbeh?\" said Abraham. \"The giant, he came here?\"\"To the north country,kaddishel. The dark forests. The Sardu men, they did not come to hunt wild pig or bear or elk. They came to hunt wolf, the family symbol, the arms of the house of Sardu. They were hunting a hunting animal. Sardu family lore said that eating wolf meat gave Sardu men courage and strength, and the young master&rsquo;s father believed that this might cure his son&rsquo;s weak muscles.\"\"Yes, Bubbeh?\"\"Their trek was long and arduous, as well as violently opposed by the weather, and Jusef struggled mightily. He had never before traveled anywhere outside his family&rsquo;s village, and the looks he received from strangers along the journey shamed him. When they arrived in the dark forest, the woodlands felt alive around him. Packs of animals roamed the woods at night, almost like refugees displaced from their shelters, their dens, nests, and lairs. So many animals that the hunters were unable to sleep at night in their camp. Some wanted to leave, but the elder Sardu&rsquo;s obsession came before all else. They could hear the wolves, crying in the night, and he wanted one badly for his son, his only son, whose gigantism was a pox upon the Sardu line. He wanted to cleanse the house of Sardu of this curse, to marry off his son, and produce many healthy heirs.\"And so it was that his father, off tracking a wolf, was the first to become separated from the others, just before nightfall on the second evening. The rest waited for him all night, and spread out to search for him after sunrise. And so it was that one of Jusef&rsquo;s cousins failed to return that evening. And so on, you see.\"\"Yes, Bubbeh?\"\"Until the only one left was Jusef, the boy giant. That next day he set out, and in an area previously searched, discovered the body of his father, and of all his cousins and uncles, laid out at the entrance to an underground cave. Their skulls had been crushed with great force, but their bodies remained uneaten--killed by a beast of tremendous strength, yet not out of hunger or fear. For what reason, he could not guess&mdash;though he did feel himself being watched, perhaps even studied, by some being lurking within that dark cave.\"Master Sardu carried each body away from the cave and buried them deep. Of course, this exertion severely weakened him, taking most of his strength. He was spent, he wasfarmutshet. And yet, alone and scared and exhausted, he returned to the cave that night, to face what evil revealed itself after dark, to avenge his forebears or die trying. This is known from a diary he kept, discovered in the woods many years later. This was his last entry.\"Continue   ReadingThe Strain",

        "B001BNFQKO": "What does the American Dream mean today?For Niko Bellic, fresh off the boat from Europe, it is the hope he can escape his past. For his cousin, Roman, it is the vision that together they can find fortune in Liberty City, gateway to the land of opportunity. As they slip into debt and are dragged into a criminal underworld by a series of shysters, thieves and sociopaths, they discover that the reality is very different from the dream in a city that worships money and status, and is heaven for those who have them and a living nightmare for those who don&rsquo;t.Beginning with the 1997 release of the originalGrand Theft Auto, theGTAseries has been one of the most prolific, controversial and down right entertaining franchises in video games history. This pedigree of success guarantees that the highly anticipated eleventh game in the series,Grand Theft Auto IV, will garner at least as much attention if not more.Return to Liberty City.The dream as Niko expected it.View larger.There's always a catch.View larger.But some skills are international.View larger.The PlotGrand Theft Auto IVis a brand new adventure in theGTAuniverse following the experiences of Nikolai \"Niko\" Bellic, a new immigrant from an undisclosed eastern European country whose troubled pa st and the persuasion of his cousin Roman have brought him to the fictional Liberty City. Unfortunately, Niko&rsquo;s search for the American Dream and a much needed fresh start, hits an immediate snag when the rags to riches story Roman spun to pique Niko's interest is exposed as not only a complete fabrication, but a ploy to enlist Niko&rsquo;s well-known skills as a tough guy against the ample list of enemies clamoring for Roman&rsquo;s debt-ridden blood.Because Roman is the only person Niko knows in Liberty City he begrudgingly accepts his role as Roman&rsquo;s protector despite the deception. But as time goes on Niko comes into his own, and his experience on the wrong side of the tracks proves more valuable than he could have ever imagined as he fights for survival and later supremacy on the crime ridden streets of Liberty City.Game EnvironmentsBased on several of the boroughs of New York City and parts of New Jersey, Liberty City, familiar to players of previous games in the series, has been entirely redesigned forGTA IV. Players can expect visible detail down to the weeds growing in the cracks in the sidewalk, cars and buildings of visibly different ages and a much greater level if verticality in the buildings and bridges that they are able to explore as Niko moves through the city streets. In addition, pedestrians inGTA IVare much more realistic. No longer simply moving cardboard cutouts, these NPCs are intelligent, modern, human representations that laugh, cry, eat, drink, use cell phones and ATMs, and talking amongst themselves regardless of Niko&rsquo;s interaction with them.GameplayHistoricallyGTAgames have focused heavily on mission-based play, requiring successful completion of fixed tasks in order for players to progress through the game, but this has changed to a great extent inGTA IV. Players will experience an entirely new and exciting emphasis centered on the blending of on-mission and off-mission play, resulting not only in an increased sense of realism, but more interesting and unrestricted gameplay.FeaturesAside from the car jacking and a detailed city environment here are the new features forGTA IV:Improved combat system - Now you can use cover and also a target lock system, which allows you to take out targets with greater ease and accuracy. Plus, you can engage in some hand-to-hand combat if you can't get your hands on a piece quick enough.Cell phone - Not just for basic phone calls anymore. Use your in-game cell phone to receive missions via SMS, snap photos, and ZiT (tag) songs that can be downloaded exclusively on Amazon.com/mp3.Free time - In between missions you can take advantage of \"me\" time. There are gentleman's clubs, comedy clubs, bowling alleys, and bars, which all house unique activities.Take a break from the storyline - A variety of side missions allow you to help run a car service, \"borrow\" cop cars, assassinate targets, help solve problems for those on the street, or take to the air with stunt jumps that are scattered all over the city.Control your own fate - Throughout the game choice moments will arrive causing you to make a decision that will affect relationships and money.MultiplayerGive Niko a rest and create your own multiplayer \"hero.\"GTAhas added multiplayer modes allowing you to take your creation out to play online in competitive, co-op, and free form modes. Competitive mode has you fighting against the cops, jacking cars, or racing to finish odd jobs. Co-op challenges you and your friends with various tasks including Hangman's NOOSE where you are responsible for escorting a wanted kingpin to a safe extraction point. Freeform lets you and 15 others lose on Liberty City. Use this mode to hit up the bar and play virtual darts versus each other or head out to the streets and set up your own drag races.

        "0060873027": "Amazon Exclusive: &ldquo;Microis Anything But Small&rdquo; by James RollinsAn avid spelunker and scuba enthusiast,James Rollinsholds a doctorate in veterinary medicine  and is the author of theNew York Timesbest-selling Sigma Force series, the most recent of which isThe Devil Colony.First I have to admit, Michael Crichton is why I write.  In fact, if not for his books, I&rsquo;d probably still be a practicing veterinarian in Northern California, dealing with flea allergies, ear infections, and all manner of medical maladies.  It was Crichton&rsquo;s stories of wild adventures, his explorations into the strange frontiers of science, and his truly ripped-from-the-headlines plotting that inspired me to set down my own scalpel and stethoscope and pick up pen and paper.But his influence went beyond mere heady inspiration.  His books also served as a tutorial into the practicalities of storytelling.  When I tackled my first novel (a deep-earth adventure titledSubterranean), I continually kept a copy ofJurassic Parkon the shelf above my desk.  That book became my roadmap on how to build a story&rsquo;s structure:  who dies first and when, at what point do we see the first dinosaur, how do you fold science into a novel without stagnating the flow?  That old copy ofJurassic Parkremains dog-eared and heavily highlighted, and it still holds a cherished place on my bookshelf.So I dove into Crichton&rsquo;s latest novel,Micro, with some trepidation, fearing how a collaborative effort might tarnish his great body of work.  Now, to be fair, I&rsquo;d also read Richard Preston&rsquo;s nonfiction masterpiece of scientific horror and intrigue,The Hot Zone.  That book was as brilliant as it was terrifying.  But still I wondered, could Preston take Crichton&rsquo;s story and truly do it justice?In a word:YES.In two words,HELL YES.Microis pure Crichton.   Dare I say,vintageCrichton, harkening back to the scientific intrigue ofAndromeda Strain, to the exploration of the natural world covered inCongo, and to the adventure and thrills ofThe Lost World.   As only Crichton can, he has taken a scientific concept as wild as the one he tackled inTimelineand exceeded in making it chillingly real.  It took a clever quirk of genetics and cloning to give rise to the dinosaurs inJurassic Park.  Likewise, a twist of science in Micro calls forth a new horror out of the natural world&mdash;but not just one line of threat.  In this book, the entire biosphere becomes a vast and deadly playground.  Its depiction is both darkly beautiful and stunningly dreadful.  It is a terrain as foreign as any hostile planet, yet as close as our own backyard.  To tell more would ruin a great adventure that will have you looking out your window with new eyes.Similarly, this lethal and toxic terrain must be traversed by a band of gutsy heroes.  But in typical Crichton style, these are not elite commandos or a highly trained black ops team.  They&rsquo;re simply a group of graduate students&mdash;each uniquely talented and flawed&mdash;gathered from various scientific disciplines:  entomology, toxicology, botany, biochemistry.  They must learn to combine resources and ingenuities to survive and ultimately thwart a danger threatening to break free into the world at large, all the while pursued by a sociopath as cunning as he is sadistic.In the end,Microhas everything you&rsquo;d expect in a Crichton novel&mdash;and so much more.  But the greatest achievement here is a simple and profound one:  with this novel, the legacy of a true master continues to shine forth in all its multifaceted glory.  And someone somewhere will read this novel, turn the last page, and in a great aura of awe and inspiration, come to a realization:I want to try to write stories like that.And they will.",

Mother and daughter have had a difficult, peripatetic life performing magic shows and conducting s&#xE9;ances, but when they land in New York City, they find a stable home and increasing fame (even Vanderbilts attend their performances). For Marguerite, it&#x2019;s a matter of being a good actress, but for 16-year-old Anna, there&#x2019;s more to it than sleight of hand, as she truly feels and sees things that are inexplicable, adding excitement and danger to their shows and lives. Regardless of whether this ability is a matter of pedigree or coincidence, it makes her a person of interest to suave young men, dangerous kidnappers, and the real-life Society for Psychical Research. Yet despite these promising details, the story&#x2019;s actual point is rather nebulous and blandly executed. Still, the 1920s elements of prohibition, automobiles, and cloche hats are interesting, and the timeless adolescent themes of self-definition, rebellion, and romance infuse the magic with a realism that may be comforting, if predictable.

It is also the land of Cate Cooper's childhood, the place where all the ghosts of her past roam freely. Cate never thought she'd wind up in this tiny cottage named the Porgy House on this breathtakingly lovely strip of coast. But circumstances have changed, thanks to her newly dead husband whose financial&mdash;and emotional&mdash;bull and mendacity have left Cate homeless, broke, and unmoored.Yet Folly Beach holds more than just memories. Once upon a time another woman found unexpected bliss and comfort within its welcoming arms. An artist, writer, and colleague of the revered George Gershwin, Dorothy Heyward enjoyed the greatest moments of her life at Folly with her beloved husband, DuBose. And though the Heywards are long gone, their passion and spirit lingers in every mango sunset and gentle ocean breeze.And for Cate, Folly, too, holds the promise of unexpected fulfillment when she is forced to look at her life and the zany characters that are her family anew. To her surprise, she will discover that you can go home again. Folly Beach doesn't just hold the girl she once was&hellip; it also holds the promise of the woman she's always wanted&mdash;and is finally ready&mdash;to become.Folly Beach, filled with the irresistible charm, saucy wit, and lush atmosphere that have won her the devotion of fans and propelled her books to bestsellerdom, is vintage Dorothea Benton Frank.A Look InsideFolly BeachClick on the images below to open larger versions.Dorothy and DuBose Heyward,from the Collections of the South Carolina Historical Society.Tourist brochure of Folly Beach,from the Collections of the South Carolina Historical Society.The way to thebeach from Porgy House.

Photo credit: Kathy Glick.Dorothea Benton Frank on WritingFolly BeachLast summer, I went down to the South Carolina Historical Society and read the papers of Dorothy and DuBose Heyward, thinking that it was DuBose who wrotePorgy and Besswith George Gershwin on Folly Beach during the summer of 1934.  Not true.My first discovery was that DuBose was a high school dropout and that Dorothy, a young orphan,  was unusually well educated and already an award winning playwright when they married. Then I discovered the huge economic disparities between them. Dorothy was wealthy and although DuBose was comfortable at the time they met, he had grown up in poverty. I ran across a copy of her birth certificate, on which her name is &ldquo;Dorothea&rdquo;&mdash;my name&mdash;and letterhead that stated she lived on Fifth and Twelfth in Manhattan&mdash;my old address&mdash; on and on.  Every time I turned around, it seemed I was bumping into another coincidence. Okay, I thought, there&rsquo;s a story here and I&rsquo;m going to try and tell it. Who wasDorothyHeyward?  And what happened that summer on Folly Beach?It is historic fact that Dorothy herself adapted DuBose&rsquo;s bookPorgyfor the stage and that she also had a great hand in creating the adaptation ofMamba&rsquo;s Daughtersfor the stage, the two most successful works with DuBose Heyward&rsquo;s name attached to them. But she shied away from taking credit for herself and spent her widowhood making sure that DuBose&rsquo;s name appeared in the credits of all of Gershwin&rsquo;s productions ofPorgy and Bessso that his estate would receive the royalties that were due.What is in those boxes at the SCHS is there because it was what Dorothy wanted us to see. Every single letter from her to DuBose is absent. Perhaps he did not save her letters or perhaps she disposed of them. We will never know. But it appears that Dorothy wanted us to have a one-sided conversation with DuBose, not her. Dorothy always wanted DuBose to be the celebrity, the icon, the one who was remembered and revered. She loved him that much.And, finally, while Dorothy Heyward may have wanted to disappear into history as &ldquo;just a girl from Ohio who wanted a career on the other side of the footlights,&rdquo; the facts appear differently to me. True, she was diminutive in the extreme, and the fact that she was from Ohio may have left her more easily dismissed by DuBose&rsquo;s crowd of aristocratic old Charlestonians.  But Dorothy Kuhns Heyward was a powerhouse, who married into one of Charleston&rsquo;s most prestigious families and spent her life doing everything she could for the man she fiercely loved who was, for his time, a civil rights pioneer.  My new novel explores their lifelong collaboration, their devotion to each other and what magic happened on Folly Beach in 1934 and in 2010, both periods of fascinating self-discovery.",

There may be catharsis in those kinds of stories, but there's often little joy, which is what makes this quiet and tender debut so disarmingly good.Stiltsvilleis a story of a marriage that begins with serendipity--that holiest of relationship grails--one warm summer day in Miami. It's 1969 when girl (Frances, the novel's clear-eyed, guileless narrator) meets boy (Dennis, who in Frances's estimation is \"careless but lucky\") at one of a copse of houses built on stilts in Miami's Biscayne Bay. That such a place existed is incredible now, and in the scenes that reconstruct its peculiar beauty, Susanna Daniel ushers you into an exotic and unpredictable corner of the country. It's a perfect place to fall in love, and Frances and Dennis do, without fanfare or pretense. Theirs is a love that almost instantly becomes constant and real, full of simple happiness that makes it possible to weather the storms that come. --Anne BartholomewCurtis Sittenfeld Interviews Susanna DanielCurtis Sittenfeld, author ofPrep,The Man of My Dreams, andAmerican Wife, andSusanna Daniel, author of the debut novelStiltsville, met at the Iowa Writers&rsquo; Workshop. Here they talk about friendship and its role in&mdash;and beyond&mdash;novels.Curtis Sittenfeld: One of the many things I love aboutStiltsvilleis that it starts with the main character, Frances, making a new friend, Marse, and then pretty much immediately falling for the guy Marse likes. Yet these two women become very close, even though only one of them can get the guy. Were you consciously defying stereotypes about female friendship, or did this just feel like the organic way to depict these characters?Susanna Daniel: There's a lot of bad press out there regarding female friendships, which are so much more nuanced than stereotypes would have us believe. When Frances meets Dennis, her friendship with Marse is just beginning, but already they both know there's potential. Neither woman wants to throw that away. There's a moment when Frances tells Marse that it's not like her to flirt with -- not to mention steal -- another woman's guy, and their future pretty much hinges on Marse believing her. Which she does. To grant your friend permission to pursue what might turn out to be the love of her life -- that's a sign of trust and humility, which Marse is strong enough to give.CS: So much ofStiltsvilleis about Frances' marriage to Dennis. I'm wondering how you think getting married and having children -- or not getting married and not having children when the people around you are -- changes the nature of women's friendships.SD: I think there's a lot of truth to the idiom that it takes a village --not only to raise a child, but to support a marriage. Because their lives take such different paths, Frances and Marse must make exceptions for each other that they might not make for other friends. Their differences might have divided them, but instead, Marse becomes a member of Frances' family in a way that a married friend could never be. Late in the book, Frances says that Marse had been almost like a second wife to Dennis in some ways, over the years. But she loves and trusts Marse like a sister, and when Marse's life changes unexpectedly, Frances must look outside her own troubles to support her friend the way she's been supported for so long.CS: Two of Frances' best friends are her daughter, Margo, and her sister-in-law, Bette. What are the particular pleasures and complications of friendships with family members?SD: Bette, Dennis's sister, is one of the most complicated characters of the book. In order to forge a friendship early on, Frances must become a confidante of Bette's, which isn't an easy thing to do. Unlike Marse, who remains in Frances' daily life until the end, Bette has to choose between family and love partway through the book -- and the choice she makes breaks Frances' heart. But later, Frances has to make a similar choice with regards to Margo. Moving away from family, inStiltsville, is not a choice made lightly or without a lot of heartache, but sometimes it's the only way for a character to grow.CS: You and I met in 1999, on our first day as graduate students at the Iowa Writers' Workshop, when we were the only two women in a class of eight. One of the most frequent questions I get about having attended the Workshop is whether it's competitive and back-stabbing. How do you answer this question?SD: The program is definitely competitive in nature, though not back-stabbing. Writing isn't a team sport -- ultimately it's all about you and what you produce. No one can undermine you if you're focused and ambitious. That said, workshopping material is not for the faint of heart -- not because people are back-stabbing but because they are bright, experienced readers, and devastatingly honest. At the same time, I'm grateful for the Workshop for many reasons, not the least of which is that it's where I met the woman who continues to be my great reader, advocate, and friend: you.CS: You're the friend I've learned the most from because you're so smart and opinionated, and you also see the world in a really different way than I do. But now that we're publicly exposing our friendship, do you think it will go the way of Gwyneth and Winona's? Also, in this scenario, which of us will end up shoplifting from Saks and which of us will dispense frittata recipes on a lifestyle website?SD: I think I'm the boring domestic of the two of us, so it might be me with the web site (I think you probably disagree with this assessment). But then again, you're staunchly ethical, so I can't see you going the way of Winona. I think a better model for our friendship, which I'm proud to publish, is that of Ann Patchett and Elizabeth McCracken, two writers who for decades have read for each other and supported each other while living in different cities. What I hope is that we continue to enjoy the differences between us -- as writers, mothers, wives, friends -- and never let them distance us. When we met, we hadn't yet made the decisions that would root our lives, as we have now. I look forward to a future when maybe we don't live so far apart, and maybe our kids play independently together while we kick back and read magazines and talk about what Winona and Gwyneth are up to these days. Because who even remembers that they were friends once, except the two of us?",

As time goes on, we learn that Sera and her family have used their power and money time and time again to influence the lives of Bhima and Maya, from caring for Bhima's estranged husband after a workplace accident, to providing the funds for Maya's college education.

Exchanging greetings with senators and other dignitaries, my heart should have been joyful; instead, I was stunned.  That morning&rsquo;sWashington Postheadline had read: &ldquo;Albright Family Tragedy Comes to Light.&rdquo;I was 59 when I learned from a reporter and from certain letters I had received that my ancestral heritage was Jewish and that more than two dozen of my relatives had died in the Holocaust.  The revelation shook my deeply ingrained sense of identity, and prompted me to seek answers to questions that I had never before thought to ask.  That search began with visits to the small towns in Czechoslovakia where my parents had grown up and to the ancient synagogue where the names of Holocaust victims are enshrined.Prague Winteris a continuation of that personal journey, but also a much wider tale concerning a generation compelled to make painful moral choices amid the tumult of war.In 1939, when efforts by British and French leaders to appease Hitler had backfired, the Nazis invaded my homeland.  I was not yet two years old.  My parents escaped with me to London where my father became head of broadcasting for the Czechoslovak government in exile.  Strangers in an embattled land, we endured along with our new neighbors the terrible bombing of the Blitz.  Back home, the German occupation quickly evolved into a reign of terror under the direction of Reinhard Heydrich, &ldquo;The Butcher of Prague.&rdquo;  As preparations were made to exterminate the country&rsquo;s Jews, Czechoslovak parachutists returned to their native soil with a mission: to kill Heydrich -- the only successful assassination of a senior Nazi during the war.  In the months that followed that daring assault, Czechs suffered from Hitler&rsquo;s vengeance, while Jews confined to the infamous Terezin ghetto struggled to retain hope despite overcrowded conditions and the periodic departure of fellow inmates on trains to the east.  In England, Czechoslovak leaders maneuvered to reclaim their country&rsquo;s independence; my mother and father agonized over the fate of loved ones who had remained behind.From the day America entered the war, my parents and their friends were confident the Allies would win. As democrats from Central Europe, they prayed that the United States&mdash;not the Soviet Union&mdash;would wield the decisive postwar influence in our region. It was not to be. When at last the Nazis were defeated, Czechoslovakia became again a battleground between democracy and totalitarianism; before long, my family was forced into exile for the second time, finding a permanent home in America.The story ofPrague Winteris often as intensely personal as a mother&rsquo;s letter, a father&rsquo;s hidden sorrow, and the earnest artwork of an imprisoned ten-year-old cousin.  The themes, however, are universal: loyalty and betrayal, respect and bigotry, accommodating evil or fighting back.  What fascinates me is why we make the choices we do. What prompts one person to act boldly in a moment of crisis and a second to seek shelter in the crowd? Why do some people become stronger in the face of adversity while others quickly lose heart?  What drives many of us to look down on neighbors based on the flimsy pretexts of nationality and creed?  Is it education, spiritual belief, parental guidance, traumatic events, or more likely some combination that causes us to follow the paths that we do?

When Art finds himself at the center of the maelstrom, Sheila returns to Boston, ready to fight for him and his reputation. What she discovers is more complicated than she imagined. Her strict, lace-curtain-Irish mother is living in a state of angry denial. Sheila's younger brother Mike, to her horror, has already convicted his brother in his heart. But most disturbing of all is Art himself, who persistently dodges Sheila's questions and refuses to defend himself.As the scandal forces long-buried secrets to surface,Faithexplores the corrosive consequences of one family's history of silence&mdash;and the resilience its members ultimately find in forgiveness. Throughout, Haigh demonstrates how the truth can shatter our deepest beliefs&mdash;and restore them. A gripping, suspenseful tale of one woman's quest for the truth,Faithis a haunting meditation on loyalty and family, doubt and belief. Elegantly crafted, sharply observed, this is Jennifer Haigh's most ambitious novel to date.A Q&amp;A with Author Jennifer HaighQ:What was your inspiration for writingFaith?Haigh:When I moved to Boston from Iowa in 2002, the city was reeling from revelations that Catholic priests had molested children, and that the Archdiocese had covered up the abuse. I was reeling too:  I was raised in a Catholic family, spent twelve years in parochial schools and had extremely fond memories of my interactions with Catholic clergy. It&rsquo;s no exaggeration to say that nuns and priests were the heroes of my childhood.  Like many people, I was horrified by what had happened in Boston--and, as later became clear, in Catholic dioceses across the country.Faithwas my attempt to explain the inexplicable, to understand what I couldn&rsquo;t make sense of in any other way.Q:Exploring the interplay between parents and children and among siblings is a delicate art that is not easily mastered, even for seasoned writers. How do you, as a storyteller, work to keep your story emotionally evocative&mdash;pulling the reader in with a depth of feeling&mdash;without falling into melodrama or treacle?Haigh:I don&rsquo;t try to make the reader feel any particular way. I just try to be accurate, to show people as they are.Q:Faithis told from the point of view of Art&rsquo;s sister, Sheila. It&rsquo;s a surprising choice, since she doesn&rsquo;t actually witness the events in question. Why did you approach the story in this way?Haigh:It took me a while to figure out how to tell this story.  When I read account of priests who&rsquo;d been accused of sexual abuse, I was struck by the difficulty of getting to the bottom of such cases. Often it comes down to one person&rsquo;s word against another:   only two people know for sure what happened, and sometimes the child is too traumatized to remember it clearly.  As Sheila tells the story, she&rsquo;s struggling to arrive at the truth, to find out whether her brother could possibly have done the things he&rsquo;s accused of, to imagine what he thought and felt, to get inside his head. In a sense, it mirrors the way all novels are written.  To me, writing is an exercise in empathy.Q:Over the course of four novels, you&rsquo;ve broadened your skills and honed your narrative dexterity, from the exquisite character sketches ofMrs. Kimble, to broader questions of family, religion, and society in the rich, multi-layered family drama that isFaith. What are you working on next?Haigh:My current project is a collection of short stories set in Bakerton, the Pennsylvania coal town where my second novel,Baker Towers, took place.Q:What inspires you as a writer&mdash;and as a reader?  Who has influenced your writing and who you are as a person?Haigh:Like all writers, I am a reader first. When my work is going well, I read. When it&rsquo;s going badly, I read more. Faulkner, William Styron, James Salter, Alice Munro, William Trevor, Richard Yates, JM Coetzee:  these are writers whose books remind me what&rsquo;s possible, why I wanted to write novels in the first place.",

        "0061132381": "In 2005, two tragedies--the Asian tsunami and Hurricane Katrina--turned CNN reporter Anderson Cooper into a media celebrity.Dispatches from the Edge, Cooper's memoir of \"war, disasters and survival,\" is a brief but powerful chronicle of Cooper's ascent to stardom and his struggle with his own tragedies and demons. Cooper was 10 years old when his father, Wyatt Cooper, died during heart bypass surgery. He was 20 when his beloved older brother, Carter, committed suicide by jumping off his mother's penthouse balcony (his mother, by the way, being Gloria Vanderbilt). The losses profoundly affected Cooper, who fled home after college to work as a freelance journalist for Channel One, the classroom news service. Covering tragedies in far-flung places like Burma, Vietnam, and Somalia, Cooper quickly learned that \"as a journalist, no matter ... how respectful you are, part of your brain remains focused on how to capture the horror you see, how to package it, present it to others.\" Cooper's description of these horrors, from war-ravaged Baghdad to famine-wracked Niger, is poignant but surprisingly unsentimental. In Niger, Cooper writes, he is chagrined, then resigned, when he catches himself looking for the \"worst cases\" to commit to film. \"They die, I live. It's the way of the world,\" he writes. In the final section ofDispatches, Cooper describes covering Hurricane Katrina, the story that made him famous. The transcript of his showdown with Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu (in which Cooper tells Landrieu people in New Orleans are \"ashamed of what is happening in this country right now\") is worth the price of admission on its own. Cooper's memoir leaves some questions unanswered--there's frustratingly little about his personal life, for example--but remains a vivid, modest self-portrait by a man who is proving himself to be an admirable, courageous leader in a medium that could use more like him. --Erica C.

Traveling first by boat, the family reaches a tent city in Guam, moves on to Florida, and is finally connected with sponsors in Alabama, where H&#xE0; finds refuge but also cruel rejection, especially from mean classmates. Based on Lai&#x2019;s personal experience, this first novel captures a child-refugee&#x2019;s struggle with rare honesty. Written in accessible, short free-verse poems, H&#xE0;&#x2019;s immediate narrative describes her mistakes&#x2014;both humorous and heartbreaking&#x2014;with grammar, customs, and dress (she wears a flannel nightgown to school, for example); and readers will be moved by H&#xE0;&#x2019;s sorrow as they recognize the anguish of being the outcast who spends lunchtime hiding in the bathroom. Eventually, H&#xE0; does get back at the sneering kids who bully her at school, and she finds help adjusting to her new life from a kind teacher who lost a son in Vietnam.

        "0099287595": "\"Every summer Lin Kong returned to Goose Village to divorce his wife, Shuyu.\" Like a fairy tale, Ha Jin's masterful novel of love and politics begins with a formula--and like a fairy tale,Waitinguses its slight, deceptively simple framework to encompass a wide range of truths about the human heart. Lin Kong is a Chinese army doctor trapped in an arranged marriage that embarrasses and repels him. (Shuyu has country ways, a withered face, and most humiliating of all, bound feet.) Nevertheless, he's content with his tidy military life, at least until he falls in love with Manna, a nurse at his hospital.  Regulations forbid an army officer to divorce without his wife's consent--until 18 years have passed, that is, after which he is free to marry again. So, year after year Lin asks his wife for his freedom, and year after year he returns from the provincial courthouse: still married, still unable to consummate his relationship with Manna. Nothing feeds love like obstacles placed in its way--right? But Jin's novel answers the question of what might have happened to Romeo and Juliet had their romance been stretched out for several decades. In the initial confusion of his chaste love affair, Lin longs for the peace and quiet of his \"old rut.\" Then killing time becomes its own kind of rut, and in the end, he is forced to conclude that he \"waited eighteen years just for the sake of waiting.\"There's a political allegory here, of course, but it grows naturally from these characters' hearts. Neither Lin nor Manna is especially ideological, and the tumultuous events occurring around them go mostly unnoticed. They meet during a forced military march, and have their first tender moment during an opera about a naval battle. (While the audience shouts, \"Down with Japanese Imperialism!\" the couple holds hands and gazes dreamily into each other's eyes.) When Lin is in Goose Village one summer, a mutual acquaintance rapes Manna; years later, the rapist appears on a TV report titled \"To Get Rich Is Glorious,\" after having made thousands in construction. Jin resists hammering ideological ironies like these home, but totalitarianism's effects on Lin are clear:Let me tell you what really happened, the voice said. All those years you waited torpidly, like a sleepwalker, pulled and pushed about by others' opinions, by external pressure, by your illusions, by the official rules you internalized. You were misled by your own frustration and passivity, believing that what you were not allowed to have was what your heart was destined to embrace.Ha Jin himself served in the People's Liberation Army, and in fact left his native country for the U.S. only in 1985. That a non-native speaker can produce English of such translucence and power is truly remarkable--but really, his prose is the least of the miracles here. Improbably, Jin makes an unconsummated 18-year love affair loom as urgent as political terror or war, while history-changing events gain the immediacy of a domestic dilemma. Gracefully phrased, impeccably paced,Waitingis the kind of realist novel you thought was no longer being written.--Mary Park--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",
        "B0028ZNX68": "Although theGuitar Heroseries has only been around since 2005, the gobs of exposure--or  perhaps over exposure--that it has received has fueled an understandable amount of skepticism among many gamers regarding the future of the overall franchise.

The turntable portion of the controller is made up of a realistic platter that spins all the way around in both directions when pushed by the player and has familiar green, red and blue buttons attached on top. The mixer half has a sliding three-position fader bar, a button used to activate star power like \"Euphoria\" gameplay sections which temporarily double point multipliers, an effects knob and a hidden control panel containing your console's standard navigational buttons. Gameplay takes you through pre matched, two-jam tracks, with the green and blue buttons oriented on the left and right edges of the note highway and on the platter representing these, and the red button in the middle providing  a spot to add samples, which can be changed at various times in the game with the effects knob. Players must perform three main types of DJ actions when prompted by the note highway: taps, which are beat matching actions requiring the pushing of buttons on the platter;  fader bar moves indicating either a selection of one of the two tracks during the jam, or a mix of the two; and scratching, which entails selecting one of the two tracks on the platter and moving the turntable quickly up and down. In addition, players can activate Euphoria strategically, as success throughout sections of a track fills the Euphoria meter at the left, and shoot for the additional bonus of a Rewind, given for perfection in certain sections, and allowing the player to replay that same section again for additional points.It's interesting how this latest release in the series parallels the historical deconstructive trend  in actual pop music, which saw Hip-hop, Electronica, House, and other musical genres rise through the use of DJ sampling and mixing techniques, but does this mean thatDJ Herowill enjoy as much success and be as good a play experience as some of theHerogames that came before it? Only time will tell, but after a few hours breaking it down on the DJ deck myself, it seems to me that the game has a major thing going against it, and an equally important positive thing going for it that together will probably decide this for most players. The negative is that the controller used is a bit more difficult to operate than any used in earlier games, except perhaps the drums ofGuitar Hero World Tour, while the positive is that the overall gameplay is as fun and infectious as any seen in the series.To be clear, the controller issues alluded to are by no means a deal breaker. More than anything else, what the vast majority of players will be challenged by in theDJ Herocontroller is their unfamiliarity with a DJ deck. As popular as DJ influenced music is in reality, not too many fans per capita have had hands-on experience with the tools of the trade, unlike the legions ofGuitar Herofans, purchasing in their millions, who are at least somewhat familiar with how a guitar, drum and microphone work. Another inconvenience related to the controller is its fairly cramped layout, with both sections residing right next to each other and no apparent way to create space between the two pieces without disconnecting them. This is enhanced by the fact that in many cases the controller may be more easily worked from a high platform in front of the standing player, potentially making this lack of space even more of a problem. But as with any new controller type, muscle memory will kick in with practice and players become more comfortable with the basic DJ mechanics of the game. There are also some simple hints doled out by the in-game tutorials that should be heeded, like when scratching make sure to let go at the end of each scratch, and anchor your hand to the turntable deck with your thumb to avoid spinning the platter too wildly. Also, the two pieces of the controller can be swapped to allow for left-handed play, and thankfullyDJ Hero's development team recognized that discouraged players are not a good thing and did away with the familiarGuitar Heroscenario of AI audiences booing a player off the stage. If you are screwing up they will still let you know, but at least players will always get the experience of finishing. At the end of each set you are rated at 1-5 stars, where the more stars you get the more tracks are unlocked and DJ gear is made available to you. The gradual organization of the game's four play settings also help you build confidence by introducing more advanced skills as you progress. In Easy, players primarily use tapping and a simplified form of scratching. The Medium setting adds fader bar functionality. Play on the Hard level requires precise directional scratching, where you must scratch in the same direction as the note highway. The assumption is that Expert level bumps things up even farther, although this level was not available with the demo played.Finally, as part of the fun built into the game, players can expect various ways to play and experience the game. These include a variety of gameplay modes including single player, a head-to-head multiplayer DJ vs. DJ mode where two players work their way through the same track for the best possible point total, the multiplayer Guitar and DJ mode which is compatible with allGuitar Heroguitars made for the same platform, and Party Mode where scoring is turned off and you can just listen to the 80+ unique mixes by big name DJs included in the game. And as with all games in theGuitar Heroseries players can expect some pretty deep character customization options to be made available as their skills rise.Taken together does all this equate to a quality music gameplay experience? Well, what I've seen is pretty solid, so if you are a fan of bothGuitar Herotype gameplay and DJ music and culture, I'd say you almost certainly will not be disappointed. Also, with its new controller, as well as different and in many places, challenging gameplay, if you are more interested inDJ Heroas a departure from series' very well-worn gameplay mold, you will probably be equally happy.Tom Milnes, Amazon.com/games freelance contributor",
        "0062220756": "A seemingly incongruous choice of subject matter for author Greenberg, well-known ESPN anchor, All You Could Ask For examines the lives of three well-to-do women from Greenwich, Connecticut. Part 1 of the novel introduces us to Brooke, the young mother still very much in love with her husband; Samantha, the newlywed shocked to discover evidence of her husband&#x2019;s infidelity while they&#x2019;re on their Hawaiian honeymoon; and Katherine, the powerful banking executive who still works for the man who broke her heart years ago. Part 2 goes on to reveal how the women come to know one another and how their lives change for the better through shared friendships. Although the novel comes off, at times, as manufactured and cloying, Greenberg&#x2019;s heart is in the right place. The shared adversity these women face is portrayed realistically and tenderly, although a storybook ending ties up the individual stories a little too neatly. The three women are well drawn, and Greenberg displays an admirable ear for realistic dialogue. Fans of Deborah Copaken Konan, Sarah Pekkanen, and contemporary ensemble fiction will enjoy this debut novel. --Stephanie Turza",
        "0060852550": "Starred Review.[Signature]Reviewed byNina PlanckMichael Pollan is the crack investigator and graceful narrator of the ecology of local food and the toxic logic of industrial agriculture. Now he has a peer. Novelist Kingsolver recounts a year spent eating home-grown food and, if not that, local. Accomplished gardeners, the Kingsolver clan grow a large garden in southern Appalachia and spend summers \"putting food by,\" as the classic kitchen title goes. They make pickles, chutney and mozzarella; they jar tomatoes, braid garlic and stuff turkey sausage. Nine-year-old Lily runs a heritage poultry business, selling eggs and meat. What they don't raise (lamb, beef, apples) comes from local farms. Come winter, they feast on root crops and canned goods, menus slouching toward asparagus. Along the way, the Kingsolver family, having given up industrial meat years before, abandons its vegetarian ways and discovers the pleasures of conscientious carnivory.This field&mdash;local food and sustainable agriculture&mdash;is crowded with books in increasingly predictable flavors: the earnest manual, diary of an epicure, the environmental battle cry, the accidental gardener.Animal, Vegetable, Miracleis all of these, and much smarter. Kingsolver takes the genre to a new literary level; a well-paced narrative and the apparent ease of the beautiful prose makes the pages fly. Her tale is both classy and disarming, substantive and entertaining, earnest and funny. Kingsolver is a moralist (\"the conspicuous consumption of limited resources has yet to be accepted widely as a spiritual error, or even bad manners\"), but more often wry than pious. Another hazard of the genre is snobbery. You won't find it here. Seldom do paeans to heirloom tomatoes (which I grew up selling at farmers' markets) include equal respect for outstanding modern hybrids like Early Girl.Kingsolver has the ear of a journalist and the accuracy of a naturalist. She makes short, neat work of complex topics: what's risky about the vegan diet, why animals belong on ecologically sound farms, why bitterness in lettuce is good. Kingsolver's clue to help greenhorns remember what's in season is the best I've seen. You trace the harvest by botanical development, from buds to fruits to roots. Kingsolver is not the first to note our national \"eating disorder\" and the injuries industrial agriculture wreaks, yet this practical vision of how we might eat instead is as fresh as just-picked sweet corn. The narrative is peppered with useful sidebars on industrial agriculture and ecology (by husband Steven Hopp) and recipes (by daughter Camille), as if to show that local food&mdash;in the growing, buying, cooking, eating and the telling&mdash;demands teamwork.(May)Nina Planck is the author ofReal Food: What to Eat and Why(Bloomsbury USA, 2006).Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0099505967": "This sixth installment in Nesb&oslash;'s popular series finds Harry Hole, Oslo's most successful and least collaborative police investigator, spending the Christmas season trying to unravel a knotty murder case while bemoaning the loss of a friendly superior and working around the demands of the strong-willed new boss. The novel alternates between Harry's sleuthing and a Croatian assassin's attempt to evade him long enough to escape the city. John Lee selects a properly surly and world-weary voice for Harry, and an accented, desperate one for the killer known as the little redeemer. Since the book travels through various strata of Oslo society and even includes a side trip to the former Yugoslavia, Lee is given ample opportunity to display a panoply of Norwegian and Croatian accents. He uses his own rich British accent to guide us smoothly through the novel's descriptive passages. Since the author packs his fast-paced scenes with crucial details easily missed, Lee's clear, crisp rendition is a blessing. However, several shifts between Harry's sections and those of the little redeemer are so abrupt&mdash;narrated by that same well-modulated voice&mdash;it may take listeners a moment to realize whose story is being told.

Almost immediately, Abdullah is whisked off on a series of adventures that bear an uncanny resemblance to his own daydreams. He meets the love of his life only to have her kidnapped by a fierce djinn. With the help of the magic carpet--and an ornery genie--Abdullah sets out to rescue his bride-to-be. His travels take him to the fairy tale land of Ingary, the setting of this novel's predecessor, Howl's Moving Castle. As usual, Jones has constructed a wonderfully complicated plot, chock-full of magical mayhem. However, while her other interconnected novels ( Charmed Life , The Magicians of Caprona and The Lives of Christopher Chant ) can be read on their own, the final third of Abdullah's story is likely to confuse readers not already acquainted with the characters introduced in the first book.

        "0060572140": "This memoir of Patchett's friendship withAutobiography of a Faceauthor Lucy Grealy shares many insights into the nature of devotion. One of the best instances of this concerns a fable of ants and grasshoppers. When winter came, the hard-working ant took the fun-loving grasshopper in, each understanding their roles were immutable. It was a symbiotic relationship. Like the grasshopper, Grealy, who died of cancer at age 39 in 2002, was an untethered creature, who liked nothing more than to dance, drink and fling herself into Patchett's arms like a kitten. Patchett (The Patron Saint of Liars;Bel Canto) tells this story chronologically, in bursts of dialogue, memory and snippets of Grealy's letters, moving from the unfolding of their deep connection in graduate school and into the more turbulent waters beyond. Patchett describes her attempts to be a writer, while Grealy endured a continuous round of operations as a result of her cancer. Later, when adulthood brought success, but also heartbreak and drug addiction, the duo continued to be intertwined, even though their link sometimes seemed to fray. This gorgeously written chronicle unfolds as an example of how friendships can contain more passion and affection than any in the romantic realm. And although Patchett unflinchingly describes the difficulties she and Grealy faced in the years after grad school, she never loses the feeling she had the first time Grealy sprang into her arms: \"[She] came through the door and it was there, huge and permanent and first.\"Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0099271478": "InThe Vampire Armand, Anne Rice returns to her indomitableVampire Chroniclesand recaptures the gothic horror and delight she first explored in her classic taleInterview with the Vampire(in which Armand, played by Antonio Banderas in the film  version, made his first appearance as director of the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre des Vampires).The story begins in the aftermath ofMemnoch the Devil. Vampires from all over the globe have gathered around Lestat, who lies prostrate on the floor of a cathedral. Dead? In a coma? As Armand reflects on Lestat's condition, he is drawn by David Talbot to tell the story of his own life. The narrative abruptly rushes back to 15th-century Constantinople, and the Armand of the present recounts the fragmented memories of his childhood abduction from Kiev. Eventually, he is sold to a Venetian artist (and vampire), Marius. Rice revels in descriptions of the sensual relationship between the young and still-mortal Armand and his vampiric mentor. But when Armand is finally transformed, the tone of the book dramatically shifts. Raw and sexually explicit scenes are displaced by Armand's introspective quest for a union of his Russian Orthodox childhood, his hedonistic life with Marius, and his newly acquired immortality. These final chapters remind one of the archetypal significance of Rice's vampires; at their best, Armand, Lestat, and Marius offer keen insights into the most human of concerns.The Vampire Armandis richly intertextual; readers will relish the retelling of critical events from Lestat and Louis's narratives. Nevertheless, the novel is very much Armand's own tragic tale. Rice deftly integrates the necessary back-story for new readers to enter her epic series, and the introduction of a few new voices adds a fresh perspective--and the promise of provocative future installments.--Patrick O'Kelley--This text refers to theHardcoveredition.",

        "0061173975": "In this sometimes provocative, often pedantic memoir of his own attempts to answer the great theological question about the persistence of evil in the world, Ehrman, a UNC&ndash;Chapel Hill religion professor, refuses to accept the standard theological answers. Through close readings of every section of the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament, he discovers that the Bible offers numerous answers that are often contradictory. The prophets think God sends pain and suffering as a punishment for sin and also that human beings who oppress others create such misery; the writers who tell the Jesus story and the Joseph stories think God works through suffering to achieve redemptive purposes; the writers of Job view pain as God's test; and the writers of Job and Ecclesiastes conclude that we simply cannot know why we suffer. In the end, frustrated that the Bible offers such a range of opposing answers, Ehrman gives up on his Christian faith and fashions a peculiarly utilitarian solution to suffering and evil in the world: first, make this life as pleasing to ourselves as we can and then make it pleasing to others. Although Ehrman's readings of the biblical texts are instructive, he fails to convince readers that these are indeed God's problems, and he fails to advance the conversation any further than it's already come.(Mar.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Hill, the son of horror master Stephen King, runs a diverse gamut that includes some unapologetic chillers along the lines of the book's title story. Yet the essence of his material could best be described as a hybrid that connects the ironic twists from episodes ofThe Twilight Zonewith the angst and vulnerability of childhood and adolescence. David LeDoux, whose previous audiobook credits include Douglas Coupland'sHey Nostradamus!and Sara Gruen'sWater for Elephants, demonstrates an especially keen knack for capturing the cadence of teen and young adult male speech patterns, with equal parts deadpan cool and quivering tension. Hill's novella Voluntary Committal provides a sublime experience of jarring suspense and compelling family drama. Admittedly, a few of the briefer works may leave listeners longing for more fully developed story lines, but Hill consistently manages to evoke emotional responses and provoke unsettling questions, which makes for a worthwhile experience.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Now, in Palin&#x2019;s much-hyped book, he&#x2019;s just a fat, smoking bullet-head who told her to &#x201C;stick to the script.&#x201D; The feeling running through Going Rogue is that Palin has been bursting to take a whack at those she believes didn&#x2019;t do right by her during the campaign. (Katie Couric, we&#x2019;re looking at you!) Before readers get to that, however, there&#x2019;s personal biography. We&#x2019;re introduced to Sarah the reader&#x2014;loved to read&#x2014;the basketball player, hunter, wife, mother. Then lots and lots of Alaska politics, which will probably be a little hard even for people from Alaska to plow through. (Scores are settled here, too.) Once Palin gets into the 2008 campaign, the tone is folksy, but the knives are out. Much has been made of her criticisms of Schmidt and another McCain staffer, Nicolle Wallace. But less has been said about Palin&#x2019;s comments about Barack Obama. For instance, she notes that when she and husband Todd first heard Obama speak, they saw the wow factor but worried that his &#x201C;smooth&#x201D; talk would hide his radical ideas. She also implies that Obama wanted to shield only his own children from the press, though, in fact, in September 2008, he told CNN that Palin&#x2019;s children must be off limits as well. Ronald Reagan&#x2019;s name is mentioned by page 3 and invoked regularly throughout. There&#x2019;s no doubt Palin sees herself as heir to his legacy. But many readers will see the Sarah Palin revealed in these pages as much closer to George Bush, someone you&#x2019;d like to have a beer with.

Kurt Wallander, who has just returned from an idyllic vacation in Rome, joins the hunt for the missing Holger Eriksson, an elderly poet. Finding the man's corpse in a ditch, impaled on sharpened bamboo stakes, brings Wallander back abruptly to the realities of crime in modern Sweden. While Wallander and his colleagues investigate the murder, another man is found dead in the local woods, making it clear that they have a brutal serial killer on their hands. The killer plans each murder carefully to ensure that the victim suffers for several days before dying. Who could hate these innocent-seeming men so much as to want to torture them to death? The police detectives must delve deeply into the victims' lives to find out what links them together and what might have made them a deadly enemy. Mankell takes the reader slowly and meticulously through the long investigation's progress, including frequent reversals. The policemen are constantly overworked and exhausted, but they make acute deductions and chase down every lead relentlessly. Mankell is a talented writer, and the translation by Steven Murray is graceful and colloquial, but the narrative is so bleak and brooding that it certainly qualifies as the darkest of Swedish noir.

AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have. In addition to adding multi-player action via xBox live, or via networked consoles, the Xbox version of Doom 3 also adds a great two-player cooperative mode.Hell on MarsYour character is a low ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the United Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars Research Facility. That's pretty much all the back-story you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the story-line department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of theDoomfranchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?) it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well crafted sound effects were successful at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly-lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth, ethereal Revenant fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy, a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking.

Yet despite his monumental discoveries, principally in the South Pacific, Cook  the man has remained an enigma. In retracing key legs of the circumnavigator's  journey, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Tony Horwitz chronicles the cultural  and environmental havoc wrought by the captain's opening of the unspoiled  Pacific to the West, as well as the alternately indifferent and passionate  reactions Cook's name evokes during the writer's journeys through Polynesia,  Australia, the Aleutians, and the explorer's native England. Horwitz skillfully  weaves a biography and travel narrative with warm humor that is natural and human-scale, and his restless inquisitiveness quickly infects the reader. While  striking dichotomies abound throughout that journey--Maori toughs who adopt Nazi  imagery to symbolize their own fight against white domination, millennia-old  Polynesian sexual mores that would shame the Reeperbahn, a sense that  Christianity decimated native cultures at least as effectively as Western  venereal diseases did--few are more poignant than the ones that abound in Cook's  own life.

The truth is more brutal. More likely, writes Anthony Bourdain inKitchen Confidential, that elegant three-star concoction is the collaborative effort of a team of \"wacked-out moral degenerates, dope fiends, refugees, a thuggish assortment of drunks, sneak thieves, sluts, and psychopaths,\" in all likelihood pierced or tattooed and incapable of uttering a sentence without an expletive or a foreign phrase.

        "0061032085": "A small town's prodigal daughter returns to face her past in bestseller Phillips's latest cheeky, diverting fairy tale. Sugar Beth Carey, \"the wild child of Parrish, Mississippi,\" was once the queen of all she surveyed, but after 15 years and three marriages, she's a broken (and broke) husk of her former self. Who's loving the schadenfreude? The Seawillows, for starters-the gaggle of Southern belles Sugar dumped years ago, plus Winnie Davis, the half-sister she treated like dirt. And there's more: not only did Sugar stomp on gorgeous Ryan Galantine's heart (luckily, Winnie caught him on the rebound), she also got Colin Byrne, the sexy British high school teacher, fired for ostensibly coming on to her. Colin now owns her family's manse, and she's inherited the carriage house on his property-along with a highly valuable painting, location unknown (might it be hiding in Colin's attic? Or is it right under her nose?). Phillips keeps the tension high, with Colin (now a successful writer and member of the town's \"in\" crowd) and all of the rest of Parrish looking to make Sugar pay for past misdeeds. Colin hires her to be his housekeeper, and soon their days are filled with bickering, backstabbing and lots of orgasmic sex. A subplot involving Gigi, Winnie and Ryan's rebellious teenage daughter, who somewhat improbably turns to Sugar Beth for advice, detracts from the primary drama. The novel is at its best when Phillips sticks with what she does best-fast-paced romps featuring two headstrong people who finally realize that they're soul mates.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "B000IMWK2G": "To make gaming as accessible to people of all ages and all abilities, Nintendo wanted to create a controller that was as inviting as it was sophisticated- the result is the Wii Remote. Nintendo fused the global familiarity of a remote control with the sophistication of motion-sensing technology to come up with an input device that differentiates the Wii from any other console that has come before it.Revolutionary controlSporting the dimensions of a small traditional remote control, the wireless Wii Remote is a multifunctional device that is limited only by the game designer's imagination. The magic of the Wii Remote's design lies within; acellerometers inside the controller body measure movement in all directions and at all speeds. In a tennis game, it serves as your racket as you swing your arm for a long forehand or a quick and hard backhand. In a 4x4 driving game it serves as a steering wheel, allowing you to swerve to avoid obstacles or pickup power-ups. In first-person shooters, the Wii Remote acts as a firearm that you can point directly at an on-screen enemy. The list of potential uses is enormous, and the light weight of the Wii Remote allows gamers to play for hours without feeling fatigued.The Wii Remote boasts impressive technology for such a compact package.All Wii Remote buttons are accessible and responsive.View larger.Control many games from up to 30 feet away.View larger.The motion sensing technology is neatly tucked away within the Wii Remote body.View larger.The remote feels comfortable in both right and left hands.View larger.As comfortable as it is functionalThe Wii Remote is equally comfortable in right and left hands and houses just the right number of buttons for gaming- not so many that new players will get confused, but enough so that Wii games don't feel constrained. On the face of the remote are the D (or \"plus\") pad, a large \"A\" button which is used for major on-screen actions, and two small options buttons. Between the game buttons are a plus and minus buttons (which often act as \"forwards\" and \"back\"), as well as a \"Home\" button to engage the Wii home screen to change settings or check remote battery levels. On the back side of the controller is a trigger-like \"B\" button, perfect for timing releases of a bowling roll inWii Sports.Thankfully, battery life is excellent with the two included AA batteries, just as with the previous generation of Nintendo wireless controllers.Immersive intelligenceAlong the bottom of the Wii Remote, four blue LED lights indicate which player position the remote is currently set to. The controller automatically connects to the Wii console via Bluetooth wireless technology. Below the LEDs, an expansion port lets you connect a number of devices including the Nunchuck and Classic controllers for Virtual Console gaming (Virtual Console games and controller accessories sold separately). Other features of the Wii Remote include adjustable rumble force-feedback and a reinforced wrist strap to ensure safe use. A speaker inside the remote gives the player feedback about the strength of swings or the accuracy of their moves- such as realistic tennis noises as the \"racket\" connects with the ball inWii Sports. Overall, the physical design of the remote is extremely sturdy and of very high quality, ensuring countless hours of Wii gaming fun!",

There are billions of dollars in advertising  moving online, waiting to be claimed by whoever can build the best content and communities.  Despite this change, most people keep working at jobs that don&rsquo;t make them happy and  businesses continue to ignore the major marketing and public relations benefits that can be  found online.Myth #1:I&rsquo;m not passionate about something sexy or popular like  wine so these lessons don&rsquo;t apply to me.The internet has drastically decreased the costs of building communities around niche  subjects, allowing for even the most obscure subjects to draw enough eyeballs to command  advertising attention.

While you may have to  fall behind on the current season of Lost or let your Madden 2010 game suffer, because  you&rsquo;ll be doing something you love you won&rsquo;t mind putting in the extra effort.InCrush It, Gary Vaynerchuk shows how anyone can build a career around what  they&rsquo;re passionate about.

        "0061176044": "Starred Review. In the spirit ofBlinkandPredictably Irrational(but with a large helping of erudition), journalist Schulz casts a fresh and irreverent eye upon the profound meanings behind our most ordinary behaviors&mdash;in this instance, how we make mistakes, how we behave when we find we have been wrong, and how our errors change us. [I]t is ultimately wrongness, not rightness, that can teach us who we are, she asserts. Schulz writes with such lucidity and wit that her philosophical enquiry becomes a page-turner. She deftly incorporates Wittgenstein, Descartes, and Freud, along with an array of contemporary social scientists and even a spin with Shakespeare and Keats. There's heavy stuff here, but no heavy-handedness. Being wrong encompasses the cataclysmic (economic collapse) and the commonplace (leaving a laptop in front of the window before the storm). Being wrong may lead to fun (playing with and understanding optical illusions) or futility (the Millerite expectation of the Rapture in 1844). Being wrong can be transformative, and Schultz writes, I encourage us to see error as a gift in itself, a rich and irreplaceable source of humor, art, illumination, individuality, and change&mdash;an apt description of her engrossing study.(June)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Chapters rotate narration among freedom-fighter Alina, privileged Quinn, and empathetic Bea. Quinn and Bea are friends, but he doesn't notice her the way she wants to be noticed. A planned camping trip in which Bea hopes to gain his affection goes awry when beautiful Alina tags along. The relaxing getaway turns serious as the group tries to avoid government forces chasing Alina and heads for the safety of a rebel stronghold. Once at the base, the story hits its only sour note. The leader and her psychopathic, orphaned child sidekick are repulsive characters. Much of the sympathy for the rebels and their just cause evaporates in their leader's lunacy. Woven throughout the trio's perilous adventure to discover if the government has lied and humankind can survive outside the dome is a thoughtful romance. Secondary characters are fully realized. Pacing is quick, but allows the tension to build. While echoes of The Hunger Games lessen the originality of the story, it won't diminish readers' interest.-Cindy Wall, Southington Library & Museum, CT&#x3B1;(c) Copyright 2011.

In 2007, nine-year-old Rahima, the middle child among five daughters, becomes a bacha posh, a girl who dresses as a boy so that she can run to the market and escort her sisters when they leave the house. Rahima enjoys incredible freedoms as a boy, from attending school to roughhousing with children her age, but it all comes to an abrupt end when Abdul Khaliq, a vicious warlord, decides he wants her for his wife. Only 13 when she&#x2019;s forced to marry Abdul Khaliq, Rahima draws her strength from her aunt&#x2019;s tales of her ancestor Shekiba, who as a young girl was scarred by kitchen oil and was reviled by her extended family after the death of her parents and siblings. Shekiba eventually found unlikely refuge in the king&#x2019;s palace in Kabul, dressing as a man to guard the king&#x2019;s harem. Alternating between Rahima and Shekiba&#x2019;s stories, Hashimi weaves together two equally engrossing stories in her epic, spellbinding debut. --Kristine Huntley",

And while the game clearly takes full advantage of the graphics  power and speed of the N64, a few components that made the original so compelling  have been left out of this release.Still, Nintendo's expertise at sucking players into the game world is strongly evident, andMario Kart 64offers enough challenges to keep players (especially casual  gamers) entertained. Placing a familiar Nintendo personality behind the wheel of a  sputtering kart powered by a 50, 100, or 150-cc engine, the game lets players race  computerized opponents or up to four other players on a variety of well-designed tracks.  Because karts lack the power and speed of race cars, drivers must focus on collecting  power-ups and nonlethal weapons rather than negotiating hairpin turns on two wheels.  Grabbing and using on-track items is the heart of the game's fun: a strategically-placed  banana peel sends the unlucky victim into a spin, nailing an opponent with a turtle shell  launches their vehicle skyward, and a rocket provides a quick boost to near-breakneck  speeds, if only for a moment.The multiplayer mode provides enormously chaotic fun for up to four players--flip it on  at a party and watch the guests congregate around the screen.--Eric TwelkerPros:Well-designed tracksSimple controlsStrong multiplayer appealCons:Computerized opponents sometimes pull off questionable feats",

        "0062120999": "Jim Collins on the Writing ProcessWhen I first embarked on a career that required writing, I devoured dozens of books about the process of writing.  I soon realized that each writer has weird tricks and idiosyncratic methods.  Some wrote late at night, in the tranquil bubble of solitude created by a sleeping world, while others preferred first morning light.  Some cranked out three pages a day, workmanlike, whereas others worked in extended bursts followed by catatonic exhaustion.  Some preferred the monastic discipline of facing cinder-block walls, while others preferred soaring views.I quickly learned that I had to discover my own methods.  Most useful, I realized that I have different brains at different times of day.  In the morning, I have a creative brain; in the evening, I have a critical brain.  If I try to edit in the morning, I&rsquo;m too creative, and if I try to create in the evening, I&rsquo;m too critical.  So, I go at writing like a two piston machine: create in the morning, edit in the evening, create in the morning, edit in the evening&hellip;Yet all writers seem to agree on one point: writing well is desperately difficult, and it never gets easier.  It&rsquo;s like running: if you push your limits, you can become a faster runner, but you will always suffer.  In nonfiction, writing is thinking; if I can&rsquo;t make the words work, that means I don&rsquo;t know yet what I think.  Sometimes after toiling in a quagmire for dozens (or hundreds) of hours I throw the whole effort into the wastebasket and start with a blank page.  When I sheepishly shared this wastebasket strategy with the great management writer Peter Drucker, he made me feel much better when he exclaimed, &ldquo;Ah, that is immense progress!&rdquo;The final months of completingGreat by Choicerequired seven days a week effort, with numerous all-nighters.  I had naively hoped after writingGood to Greatthat perhaps I had learned enough about writing that this work might not require descending deep into the dark cave of despair.  Alas, the cave of darkness is the only path to producing the best work; there is no easy path, no shorter path, no path of less suffering.  Winston Churchill once said that writing a book goes through five phases.  In phase one, it is a novelty or a toy; by phase five, it is a tyrant ruling your life, and just as you are about to be reconciled to your servitude, you kill the monster and fling him to the public.  And so, exiting the caving blinking in the sunlight, we&rsquo;ve killed the monster and hereby fling.  We love this book, and have great passion about sharing it with the world&mdash;making all the suffering worthwhile.A Q&amp;A with Morten T. HansenQ:How did you and Jim develop ideas together during the research?Hansen:During our hundreds of research meetings&mdash;what we called &ldquo;chimposiums&rdquo; (as when two curious chimps get together), Jim and I probed the data, exchanged views, and debated vigorously. We didn't always agree, in which case we did some more analysis to get to the main findings we report in Great by Choice.Q:Why didGreat by Choicetake nine years of effort?Hansen:When Jim and I started out some nine years ago, we did not anticipate that it would take us this long, nor did we know what the results would be.  We followed a simple principle&mdash;carry out the absolutely best research we could possibly do, no matter how long.Q:Did you find what you expected, or surprises?Hansen:The way we did the research was to explore why some companies attained great performance over the long-run while others did not. We did not start with any preconceived ideas and hypotheses about what made the difference. We let the data speak. What we found, and what we report in the book, surprised us a great deal. A few times we scratched our heads because we were so surprised, but that's what the data revealed.Q:Did you have fun?Hansen:Analyzing the data, debating, and arriving at some really interesting insights was a great deal of fun. It created joy in my life. It may not be everyone's idea of having a good time, but Jim and I always looked forward to our chimposiums.

Features such as video chat, Internet access, digital photo viewing, and digital audio and video will likely make it the central component of your media set-up. Still, it is first and foremost a game console--a powerful one at that.Under the HoodThe PS3 features IBM's \"Cell\" processor and a co-developed Nvidia graphics processor that makes the system able to perform two trillion calculations per second. That's approximately 320 times more calculations per second than the PS2. Along with the traditional AV and composite connections, it also boasts an HDMI port, which delivers uncompressed, unconverted digital picture and sound to compatible high-definition TV and projectors. The system is capable of 128-bit pixel precision and 1080p resolution for a full HD experience.PlayStation 3: Tower of powerA sleek new lookWith the wireless, motion-sensitive controllerBlu-Ray is the New WaySony's PlayStation 3 games are encoded onto the Blu-Ray disc media format, which can hold six times as much data as traditional DVDs. This increase in capacity--combined with the awesome power of its processor and graphics card--promises mind-blowing games once developers have learned how to fully harness the new console's power. The PS3 will also support CD-ROM, CD-RW, DVD, DVD-ROM, DVD-R, DVD+R formats.In addition, PlayStation 3 system software update version 2.20 and up includesBD Live support. With this you can now play discs that support Blu-ray Disc Profile 2.0 (BD-LIVE) and you can also connect to the Internet while playing discs that support this format so that you can obtain additional features. Features that are available vary depending on the software in use.Sensational ControllerNew gamers intuitively move the controller while playing, even though that movement has traditionally had no relation to what's going on in the game. Sony has picked up on this tendency and is using it to bring a new level of control into the PS3. Inside the controller is a high-precision six-axis sensing system that accurately detects fine movements in pitch, roll, and yaw, as well as three dimensions of movement, to control games. This means that future PS3 games will be controlled by the movements of your hands rather than just your thumbs. For example, you might be able to steer a car by holding the controller like a steering wheel.While the PS3 controller looks much like its Dual Shock predecessors, it will lack the force-feedback vibration since that would only interfere with the sensing system. It uses Bluetooth 2.0 wireless technology and can support up to seven wireless controllers at a time. It's a hot-swappable system, so if your controller is running low on power, just pause your game and connect a USB 2.0 cable. You can continue playing while your controller recharges automatically.Plays All PlayStation GamesThe PlayStation 3 will be backward compatible with PlayStation and PlayStation 2 games, which means you'll be able to play all your favorite games without keeping all the old systems. The console will have slots for Memory Stick Duo, an SD slot and a Compact Flash memory slot. It comes with a pre-installed hard disc drive, which allows you to save games as well as download content from the Internet.Gran Turismo HDResistance: Fall of ManA Slew of New GamesA whole host of game publishers are already backing the PS3 and several have even confirmed games for the console. At the 2006 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), more than 30 titles were displayed for the system, includingGran Turismo HD,Resistance: Fall of Man, andFinal Fantasy XIII. Previously announced titles includeMetal Gear Solid 4,Devil May Cry 4andTekken 6.OnlineSony has stated that the PS3 will have similar online connectivity and services as the next generation of Xbox Live. Calling it \"an always on, always connected device,\" SCEI's chief technical officer Masa Chatani said the PS3 would be constantly in touch with a \"PlayStation World\" network \"fundamentally based on community, communication commerce, and content.\" Technically, the infrastructure is there to make that connection.

But as Winifred discovers, there is no evidence that the Ripper ever visited Hampstead, let alone buried one of his victims inside the chimney of a house there, and his presence in the story is a red herring. Much more interesting is the mysterious disappearance of Winnie's cousin, John Comestor, the latest resident of the family house. Moreover, something is making an infernal racket inside the chimney, and soon there are other bizarre manifestations of some unseen force. A Dickensian assortment of neighbors (one dotty lady is called Mrs. Maddingly) variously obfuscate and hint at strange events. Maguire's prose is both jaunty and scary; he knows how to mix spooky ingredients with contemporary situations. By the time a spirit called Gervasa begins to speak through Winnie, readers will be hooked.Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

        "0060195339": "Sportswriter Leavy describes her book as not so much a biography of a ballplayer as a social history of baseball, with the former star pitcher's career as the barometer of change. While both a preface and an introduction spin Leavy's storytelling wheels, a compelling, literary social history does indeed get rolling. Koufax refused to participate in the project, so Leavy has spoken to hundreds of people with something to share on the former Brooklyn/L.A. Dodger Hank Aaron, Joe Torre, childhood friend and Mets co-owner Fred Wilpon and even the old Dodgers equipment manager among them and their testimonies make for a rich baseball pastiche and an engaging look at the game's more innocent period. Koufax capped off his first year by watching the 1955 World Series against the hated Yankees from the bench, and following the Dodgers' historic victory headed from Yankee Stadium to class at Columbia University, where he studied architecture (in case the baseball thing didn't work out). Even when Leavy's historical anecdotes are quaint, they prove timely: she details Koufax holding out for a better contract with fellow star pitcher Don Drysdale in '66, paving the way for free agency. While Leavy's interest in Koufax's Jewish heritage at times seems to border on the obsessive, she delivers an honest and exquisitely detailed examination of a complex man, one whose skills were such that slugger Willie Stargell once likened hitting against Koufax to \"trying to drink coffee with a fork.\"Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.",

Their job: investigate the disappearance of a multiple murderess from a locked room. Tom Stechschulte's rendition of the endlessly shifting story line is a tour de force. He begins by capturing the easygoing male bonding of the two lawmen and slowly adds a harder edge to the narration as they meet the odd people in charge of the facility and encounter an assortment of increasingly disturbing events.

At heart it means to be entirely practical, as the \"Science\" of the name would indicate. Denying any interest in theology (there is no theology in the Bible, Fox argues), the author instead suggests that what Jesus was after was results: \"Jesus explains to us what the nature of God is, and what our own nature is; tells us the meaning of life and of death; shows us why we make mistakes; why we yield to temptation; why we become sick, and impoverished, and old; and, most important of all, he tells us how all these evils may be overcome, and how we may bring health, happiness, and true prosperity into our lives.\"And the Spiritual Key? Fox puts it quite simply: \"The Truth turns out to be nothing less than the amazing but undeniable fact that the whole outer world--whether it be the physical body, the common things of life, the winds and the rain, the clouds, the earth itself--is amenable to man's thought, and that he has dominion over it when he knows it.\"--Doug Thorpe",

        "0006476155": "This second big winter thriller by a writer named Patterson (see Fiction Forecasts, Oct. 19) features a villain (a multiple-personality serial killer/kidnapper) whom the publisher hopes will remind readers of Thomas Harris's Hannibal Lecter, and a hero who is compared to those of Jonathan Kellerman. Unfortunately, the novel has few merits of its own to set against those authors' works. Hero Alex Cross is in fact a black senior detective in Washington, D.C., who is also a psychiatrist and has a facile but not entirely convincing line of sentimental-cynical patter. The villain is Gary Soneji/Murphy (read Hyde/Jekyll), who kills for recognition, and finally kidnaps the kids of prominent parents. Alex is soon on the case, more enraged by Gary's killing of poor ghetto blacks than by the Lindbergh-inspired kidnapping, and becomes involved with a gorgeous, motorcycle-riding Secret Service supervisor who is not what she seems. Soneji/Murphy is eventually captured--but can the bad part of him be proven guilty? There is even a hint at the end that he may survive for a sequel, though the reader has virtually forgotten him by then. Spider reads fluently enough, but its action and characters seem to have come out of some movie-inspired never-never land. If a contemporary would-be nail-biter is to thrill as it should, it urgently needs stronger connections to reality than this book has.

As a young black man in the Chicago of the '30s, he has no way out of the walls of poverty and racism that surround him, and after he murders a young white woman in a moment of panic, these walls begin to close in. There is no help for him--not from his hapless family; not from liberal do-gooders or from his well-meaning yet naive friend Jan; certainly not from the police, prosecutors, or judges. Bigger is debased, aggressive, dangerous, and a violent criminal. As such, he has no claim upon our compassion or sympathy. And yet...A more compelling story thanNative Sonhas not been written in the 20th century by an American writer. That is not to say that Richard Wright created a novel free of flaws, but that he wrote the first novel that successfully told the most painful and unvarnished truth about American social and class relations. AsIrving Howeasserted in 1963, \"The dayNative Sonappeared, American culture was changed forever. It made impossible a repetition of the old lies [and] brought out into the open, as no one ever had before, the hatred, fear and violence that have crippled and may yet destroy our culture.\"Other books had focused on the experience of growing up black in America--including Wright's own highly successfulUncle Tom's Children, a collection of five stories that focused on the victimization of blacks who transgressed the code of racial segregation. But they suffered from what he saw as a kind of lyrical idealism, setting up sympathetic black characters in oppressive situations and evoking the reader's pity. InNative Son, Wright was aiming at something more. In Bigger, he created a character so damaged by racism and poverty, with dreams so perverted, and with human sensibilities so eroded, that he has no claim on the reader's compassion:\"I didn't want to kill,\" Bigger shouted. \"But what I killed for, I am! It must've been pretty deep in me to make me kill! I must have felt it awful hard to murder.... What I killed for must've been good!\" Bigger's voice was full of frenzied anguish. \"It must have been good! When a man kills, it's for something... I didn't know I was really alive in this world until I felt things hard enough to kill for 'em. It's the truth...\"Wright's genius was that, in preventing us from feeling pity for Bigger, he forced us to confront the hopelessness, misery, and injustice of the society that gave birth to him.--Andrew Himes",

But when she visits a fortune-teller with a trio of mismatched friends, a marriage is predicted for the near future. When the fortune-teller's prophecies for the other three come true in peculiar ways, even disbelieving, boyfriendless Lucy begins to suspect that, somehow, wedding bells will ring for her. The identity of the lucky man will come as no surprise, though Lucy remains oblivious until the very end, but there are many eligible bachelors on the scene, among them Gus, Lucy's sexy but unreliable new lover; Daniel, her oldest friend; Chuck, a handsome American; and Adrian, the video shop man. The attendant mayhem includes drunken meals at ethnic restaurants, flamenco dancing accidents, blind dates gone wrong and many delicious confessions and revelations. As Lucy says, \"I was still at that stage in my life when I thought that weekdays were for recovering from the weekend,\" but more often than not, her weekdays are as full of exhausting fun as her weekends.

        "0099282194": "Athena College was snoozing complacently in the Berkshires until Coleman Silk--formerly \"Silky Silk,\" undefeated welterweight pro boxer--strode in and shook the place awake. This faculty dean sacked the deadwood, made lots of hot new hires, including Yale-spawned literary-theory wunderkind Delphine Roux, and pissed off so many people for so many decades that now, in 1998, they've all turned on him. Silk's character assassination is partly owing to what the novel's narrator, Nathan Zuckerman, calls \"the Devil of the Little Place--the gossip, the jealousy, the acrimony, the boredom, the lies.\"But shocking, intensely dramatized events precipitate Silk's crisis. He remarks of two students who never showed up for class, \"Do they exist or are they spooks?\" They turn out to be black, and lodge a bogus charge of racism exploited by his enemies. Then, at 71, Viagra catapults Silk into \"the perpetual state of emergency that is sexual intoxication,\" and he ignites an affair with an illiterate janitor, Faunia Farley, 34. She's got a sharp sensibility, \"the laugh of a barmaid who keeps a baseball bat at her feet in case of trouble,\" and a melancholy voluptuousness. \"I'm back in the tornado,\" Silk exults. His campus persecutors burn him for it--and his main betrayer is Delphine Roux.In a short space, it's tough to convey the gale-force quality of Silk's rants, or the odd effect of Zuckerman's narration, alternately retrospective and torrentially in the moment. The flashbacks to Silk's youth in New Jersey are just as important as his turbulent forced retirement, because it turns out that for his entire adult life, Silk has been covering up the fact that he is a black man. (If this seems implausible, consider that the famousNew York Timesbook critic Anatole Broyard did the same thing.) Young Silk rejects both the racism that bars him from Woolworth's counter and the Negro solidarity of Howard University. \"Neither the they of Woolworth's nor the we of Howard\" is for Coleman Silk. \"Instead the raw I with all its agility.Self-discovery--thatwas the punch to the labonz....  Self-knowledge butconcealed. What is as powerful as that?\"Silk's contradictions power a great Philip Roth novel, but he's not the only character who packs a punch. Faunia, brutally abused by her Vietnam vet husband (a sketchy guy who seems to have wandered in from a lesser Russell Banks novel), scarred by the death of her kids, is one of Roth's best female characters ever.

        "B00008J7NZ": "Halo 2is one of those rare video games that garnishes attention from regular folk who wouldn't know which direction to point a game controller. With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings",

        "0060594667": "Product DescriptionEdgar Award-winning author Tom Franklin returns with his most accomplished and resonant novel so far&#x2014;an atmospheric drama set in rural Mississippi. In the late 1970s, Larry Ott and Silas \"32\" Jones were boyhood pals. Their worlds were as different as night and day: Larry, the child of lower-middle-class white parents, and Silas, the son of a poor, single black mother. Yet for a few months the boys stepped outside of their circumstances and shared a special bond. But then tragedy struck: Larry took a girl on a date to a drive-in movie, and she was never heard from again. She was never found and Larry never confessed, but all eyes rested on him as the culprit. The incident shook the county&#x2014;and perhaps Silas most of all. His friendship with Larry was broken, and then Silas left town.More than twenty years have passed. Larry, a mechanic, lives a solitary existence, never able to rise above the whispers of suspicion. Silas has returned as a constable. He and Larry have no reason to cross paths until another girl disappears and Larry is blamed again. And now the two men who once called each other friend are forced to confront the past they've buried and ignored for decades.A Q&amp;A with Author Tom FranklinQ:Tell us a bit about your latest bookCrooked Letter, Crooked Letter. How did you come up with the title?Franklin:Title's a pneumonic device used to teach children (mostly southern children) how to spell Mississippi.  M, I, crooked-letter, crooked-letter, I, crooked-letter, crooked-letter, I, humpback, humback, I.Q:Crooked Letter, Crooked Letteris a bit of a departure from your previous two novels&#x2014;SmonkandHell at the Breech&#x2014;in that it is set in contemporary times and the story line is a bit less dark. What inspired the premise for this novel and the departure from a more historical setting?Franklin:I'd been wanting to write about a small town police officer, and I'd long had the image of a loner mechanic in my mind.  When I put the two together, the story began to form.  I used a lot of autobiographical stuff for Larry, the mechanic.Q:A review inUSA Today(forHell at the Breech) stated that, &#x201C;he also makes his characters rise up from the pages as if they were there with you.&#x201D; &#x2026;and this is certainly true in your latest novel. How do you approach the task of developing your characters and bringing them to life? Are the characters inCrooked Letter, Crooked Letterbased on anyone in particular?Franklin:They're both a combination of different facets of different people, a conglomeration of fact and fiction.  I usually try to just let them begin to do what they want to do, just put them in a situation and see what they do.  When they begin to surprise me, do things I hadn't anticipated, that's when it's working.But the character of Silas \"32\" Jones is very loosely based on the sole police officer of the hamlet of Dickinson, Alabama, where I grew up.  This guy was actually the law in a nearby mill town, and my hamlet of Dickinson fell in his tiny jurisdiction.  I've always loved the idea of small town cops, especially one who might be a kind of underdog to the police forces of nearby larger towns.Q:InCrooked Letter, Crooked Letteryour two main characters are anything but stereotypical&#x2014;the young black boy goes off to college to play baseball and comes back to be the town constable and the young white boy is the accused murderer and the town outcast. What, if anything, prompted you to portray these characters this way?Franklin:No real person is a stereotype, and I try to make my characters as real as I can.  We're all a mess of contradictions and secrets, strangenesses and desires, and nobody's all good or all bad.  We're all somewhere in the spectrum between absolute good and absolute evil.  So I just try to find a character who's fairly normal, and put him or her in a fix and see how he or she negotiates it to see, as Kurt Vonnegut says, what he or she is made of. In this case, the story as I came to understand it called for Larry to stay home and Silas to leave.  If it had been the other way around, I'd still work to make the characters unstereotypical.Q:Without giving away too much of the story, what is one thing (emotion, thought) that readers can expect to walk away with after reading this book?Franklin:It's a sad book, but it's full of hope.  Hope is what I want a reader to leave with.Q:Historically the South has not always had a positive image in other parts of the country. How has your experience growing up and living in the rural South shaped your talent as a writer? And have you ever felt the need to justify or redeem the South&#x2019;s past in any of your works?Franklin:I think growing up in the south made me the person I am, and the writer I am comes from that.  So, yes, the south's made me the writer I am.  It taught me to listen to the cadences and rhythms of speech, and to notice the landscape.  It also has this defeated feel, a lingering of old sin, that makes it sweet in a rotting kind of way.  Much of it is poor, much is rural, and that's an interesting combination, a deep well for stories.Q:Did you always know that you wanted to be a writer? Who are some writers, past and present, that you admire or have inspired you?Franklin:I always knew I wanted to tell stories, one way or another.  If I'd had a video camera in the mid 1970s I'm sure I'd be a filmmaker now.  But I just had a portable typewriter, and so the stories I could tell were ones on paper.Q:You are one of the most celebrated writers in the field, and have been compared to the likes ofHarper Lee,William Faulkner, andElmore Leonard.  What do you believe is the one thing that sets you apart from other contemporary writers in your genre?Franklin:What sets me apart?  I honestly don't know that I&#x2019;m more \"apart\" from other writers of my generation.  Landscape plays a large role in what I write, but that's true of many other writers.  My stuff is set in the south, but that's true of others as well.  I don't know, honestly.Q:As a professor of English, what is one piece of advice that you would share with aspiring writers?Franklin:Read, starting with the classics.  Read all the time.  If you don't read, you won't ever be a writer.  Also, write.  This seems obvious, but it's amazing how many \"writers\" don't write very much.",

Bradbury's vividly painted society holds up the appearance of happiness as the highest goal--a place where trivial information is good, and knowledge and ideas are bad. Fire Captain Beatty explains it this way, &quot;Give the people contests they win by remembering the words to more popular songs.... Don't give them slippery stuff like philosophy or sociology to tie things up with. That way lies melancholy.&quot;Guy Montag is a book-burning fireman undergoing a crisis of faith. His wife spends all day with her television &quot;family,&quot; imploring Montag to work harder so that they can afford a fourth TV wall. Their dull, empty life sharply contrasts with that of his next-door neighbor Clarisse, a young girl thrilled by the ideas in books, and more interested in what she can see in the world around her than in the mindless chatter of the tube. When Clarisse disappears mysteriously, Montag is moved to make some changes, and starts hiding books in his home. Eventually, his wife turns him in, and he must answer the call to burn his secret cache of books. After fleeing to avoid arrest, Montag winds up joining an outlaw band of scholars who keep the contents of books in their heads, waiting for the time society will once again need the wisdom of literature.Bradbury--the author of more than 500 short stories, novels, plays, and poems, includingThe Martian ChroniclesandThe Illustrated Man--is the winner of many awards, including the Grand Master Award from the Science Fiction Writers of America.

        "0060955775": "When Paulo Coelho (The Alchemist) was a young man, his parents had him committed to mental hospitals three times because he wanted to be an artist--an unacceptable profession in Brazil at the time. During his numerous forced incarcerations he vowed to write some day about his experiences and the injustices of involuntary commitment. In this fable-like novel, Coelho makes good on his promise, with the creation of a fictional character named Veronika who decides to kill herself when faced with all that is wrong with the world and how powerless she feels to change anything. Although she survives her initial suicide attempt, she is committed to a mental hospital where she begins to wrestle with the meaning of mental illness and whether forced drugging should be inflicted on patients who don't fit into the narrow definition of \"normal.\" The strength and tragedy of Veronika's fictional story was instrumental in passing new government regulations in Brazil that have made it more difficult to have a person involuntarily committed.

Kingsolver's ambitious new novel, her first in nine years (after theThe Poisonwood Bible), focuses on Harrison William Shepherd, the product of a divorced American father and a Mexican mother. After getting kicked out of his American military academy, Harrison spends his formative years in Mexico in the 1930s in the household of Diego Rivera; his wife, Frida Kahlo; and their houseguest, Leon Trotsky, who is hiding from Soviet assassins. After Trotsky is assassinated, Harrison returns to the U.S., settling down in Asheville, N.C., where he becomes an author of historical potboilers (e.g.,Vassals of Majesty) and is later investigated as a possible subversive. Narrated in the form of letters, diary entries and newspaper clippings, the novel takes a while to get going, but once it does, it achieves a rare dramatic power that reaches its emotional peak when Harrison wittily and eloquently defends himself before the House Un-American Activities Committee (on the panel is a young Dick Nixon). Employed by the American imagination, is how one character describes Harrison, a term that could apply equally to Kingsolver as she masterfully resurrects a dark period in American history with the assured hand of a true literary artist.(Nov.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0061856436": "Amazon Exclusive: A Letter from Sarah SilvermanDear Reader:My name is Sarah Silverman.  I was once primarily known for saying the word \"poop\" and getting paid above market rates for it.  But those days are over, because I am now going to be known for having written a book.  Why did I write a book, you might wonder?  Because it just seemed like the right time to be getting into the publishing industry.I'm kidding.  Publishing is rotting like an abandoned possum carcass on the shoulder of I-95.  I know that for a fact, because shortly after my book deal was announced, I kept hearing people lament the imminent demise of literature.  These days there is only one reason to write a book:to be taken seriously.  And that is exactly what is about to happen to me.  I'm an author now!  Like Ernest Hemingway and Fyodor Dostoevsky!When I was asked to provide text for an author page, I decided to approach it in a scholarly manner, because that's what authors do.  I looked to other author pages for inspiration, and I learned so much.  For example, while Hemingway and Dostoevsky do not have their own author pages on Amazon.com, Paris Hilton does.  And so does former teenage porn star and multi-tasking fellatrix, Traci Lords.  Hemingway and Dostoevsky might be wondering, quite literally, \"Whom do I have to blow to get my own author page?\"  If someone had a cruel sense of humor, they might respond to Hemingway, \"How about your head off?  Oh wait &ndash; you already DID that!\"  But such a remark would be in bad taste, and as a serious author, I'm above all that.I also learned that Paris' dog, Tinkerbell Hilton, has her own book too.  I read a few pages and found the prose to be overwrought, but you can imagine that, being a dog, she'd be coming from a place of needing to prove something.  By the way, here's a quote from a review of Paris' book that I found on her Amazon.com author page:\"Heiress, socialite, model, actress, singer and media darling Hilton loves her life, knows how to get what she wants and matter-of-factly explains how anyone can be a glamorous, fun-loving, tiara-wearing heiress just like her&hellip; [Paris&rsquo;] advice to 'channel your own inner heiress, create your own image, and project an extreme sense of confidence' is an empowering message for young women.\"This was profoundly inspiring to me.  It made me realize: if young women can read Hilton's book and become heiresses, they can likewise read my book and become anxiety-ridden bedwetters.  And amidst this generation of disposability that favors the digital over the physical, shopping online rather than in stores (oops, this is awkward!), and reading from LCD screens rather than from print on paper, it's nice to know that I will have left a permanent stain by which future generations shall know of my existence.

This new novel, found in manuscript form among his papers, will come as a bit of a surprise to many of his fans. It is, of all things, a pirate novel. Set in 1665, it tells the story of Captain Charles Hunter, a privateer who&#x2019;s hired by the governor of Jamaica&#x2019;s Port Royal to steal a Spanish galleon and its cargo of gold treasure. Don&#x2019;t expect to see Jack Sparrow in this story of pirates of the Caribbean, though: Crichton doesn&#x2019;t play his pirates for laughs. And this is no typical pirate adventure, either: it&#x2019;s actually a caper novel posing as a high-seas adventure. All the key caper-novel elements are here: the target, the mastermind, the plan, the motley crew, the ruthless villain, the gadgets, the twist, and the turncoat. Crichton keeps us in a constant state of suspense, never revealing quite what his hero, Captain Hunter, has up his sleeve, and the novel ends most unexpectedly. Pirate fans will love the book for its flashy characters and historical authenticity. Crime fans will enjoy the caper-novel structure and the way the author keeps them on their toes.

And many believe these shifts are doing more than just rocking the political and social climate; they're rocking the American core.What are these changes? Who, in addition to President Obama, have been the biggest forces behind them? What exactly do they mean for you, the everyday American citizen? How are they affecting your money, health, safety, freedom, and standing in this nation? Which are Pinheaded moves and which are truly Patriotic? In his latest spirited book, O'Reilly prompts further debate with the President and the American people on the current state of the union.After five consecutive, no-nonsense, tell-it-like-it-is megabestsellers, you can count on Bill to offer blunt and constructive political commentary. And as he did in his popular memoir, he offers some introspection too, looking back at his own actions and those of past Pinheads and Patriots who have inspired a code of conduct for such taxing times.As always, O'Reilly is fair, balanced, and uncompromisingly tough when guarding the American way. Only Pinheads would fail to fight for what they love most about this country or to embrace some measure of change to make it better. The rest of us Patriots will read this book to discover the difference between the two.",
        "0061241709": "Covel (Trend Following) revisits a famous financial trading experiment conducted by Wall Street trader Richard Dennis and extracts its lessons with mixed results. Dennis, who quickly learned how to trade after starting as a runner at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in 1966 at age 17, had made a reported $200 million by 1983. To settle an argument with fellow trader William Eckhardt about whether trading ability was innate or could be taught, he put an ad in theWall Street Journaloffering to teach candidates how to trade in two weeks, and then backed them with his own money. Of the thousands of people who who applied, 23 turtles were accepted. Their trading made $100 million for Dennis, leading some to become highly successful traders in their own right. Having tracked down most of the people involved, Covel describes the turtle training, including rules for entering and exiting trades as well as Dennis and Eckhardt's personal lessons, and speculates on why some turtles succeeded more than others. However, there are too many characters with competing interests, and many missing facts. Covel's own strong views can also get more emphasis than the voices of the principals. Still, the book is a useful training manual distilling the lessons of a fascinating experiment.(Oct.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Players control Ico with the goal of  escaping the castle with the princess safely in hand.Although it looks like an adventure game and has some rudimentary action  sequences, Ico is mostly about solving puzzles. Players will run, jump, and  climb their way through the gargantuan castle as well as figure out which  objects and environments are interactive. Yorda is very much a damsel in  distress, and isn't nearly as capable as Ico. A great deal of the puzzles  require the player to create a safe path for Yorda, who isn't physically able to  get to the places Ico can. The puzzles are quite brilliant, although a few are  so tough that players will feel like ditching the princess.Graphics, particularly the lighting effects and animations, are fantastic. The  developers did a superb job of conveying the enormity and beauty of the castle.  When Ico and Yorda move and interact, their actions seem totally lifelike.

Sent as ambassador to the Northern principality of Uberwald where they mine gold, iron, and fat--but never silver--he is caught up in an uneasy truce between dwarfs, werewolves, and vampires in the theft of the Scone of Stone (a particularly important piece of dwarf bread) and in the old werewolf custom of giving humans a short start in the hunt and then cheating.Pratchett is always at his best when the comedy is combined with a real sense of jeopardy that even favorite characters might be hurt if there was a good joke in it. As always, the most unlikely things crop up as the subjects of gags--Chekhov, grand opera, the Caine Mutiny--and as always there are remorselessly funny gags about the inevitability of story:They say that the fifth elephant came screaming and trumpeting through the atmosphere of the young world all those years ago and landed hard enough to split continents and raise mountains.No one actually saw it land, which raised the interesting philosophical question: when millions of tons of angry elephant come spinning through the sky, and there is no one to hear it, does it--philosophically speaking--make a noise?As for the dwarfs, whose legend it is, and who mine a lot deeper than other people, they say that there is a grain of truth in it.All this, the usual guest appearances, and Gaspode the Wonder Dog.--Roz Kaveney, Amazon.co.uk--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

In the hands of writers such asDavid James DuncanandNorman Maclean, the simple, repetitive motions of baseball, fly-fishing, and golf have acquired almost numinous significance. InThe Tennis Partner, Dr. Abraham Verghese takes on his own fascination with tennis and comes up with as good an explanation as any: \"In the way we controlled the movement of a yellow ball in space, we were imposingorderon a world that was fickle and capricious. Each ball that we put into play, for as long as it went back and forth between us, felt like a charm to be added to a necklace full of spells, talismans, and fetishes, which one day add up to an Aaron's rod, an Aladdin's lamp, a magic carpet. Each time we played, this feeling of restoring order, of mastery, was awakened.\"For both Verghese and his tennis partner, a fourth-year medical student named David Smith, the game is a much-needed island of order in the midst of personal chaos. Both men are struggling to rebuild their lives, Verghese undergoing a painful divorce, Smith struggling with an intravenous cocaine addiction. For a brief, idyllic period, their friendship flourishes; Verghese mentors Smith in the examining room, while Smith, an Australian who competed briefly on the pro circuit, ends up Verghese's teacher on the court. But there are dark corners to David's personality, and under the mounting pressures of medical school and his increasingly complicated love life, these come to the fore. Even as he learns how to inhabit his new life, Verghese watches with horror as his friend relapses, dries out, then relapses again. The author of the powerfulMy Own Country, a chronicle of caring for AIDS patients in rural Tennessee, Verghese once again proves that the skills of a good doctor are strikingly similar to those of a good writer. Careful observation, compassion, restraint: these are the instruments Verghese uses to stunning effect inThe Tennis Partner. A paean to the healing powers of tennis, this book is also a moving meditation on friendship, fatherhood, love, addiction, and the particular loneliness of physicians.--Mary Park",
        "009952712X": "Originally published in 1946 and out of print for decades, this book by the Nobel Prize-winning Icelandic author is a huge, skaldic treat filled with satire, humor, pathos, cold weather and sheep. Gudbjartur Jonsson becomes Bjartur of Summerhouses when, after 18 years of service to the Bailiff of Myri, he is able to buy his own croft. Summerhouses is probably haunted and is certainly unprepossessing, but Bjartur is a stubborn, leathery old (whatever his age) coot, and he soon has his new bride and few head of sheep installed in a sod house. When his wife dies cold and alone giving birth to the daughter of the Bailiff's son, Bjartur takes the child on almost as another test of his independence. Bjartur survives another wife, three sons that lived and several dead ones, all with his \"armour of scepticism,\" which \"endowed him with greater moral fortitude than that possessed by the other men.\" Through hard times (in the guises of worms and a cow that threaten his precious sheep), Bjartur maintains his ferocious and self-destructive independence, one aimed not so much at bettering his condition as being able to tell his former employer where to get off. Laxness is merciless with the hypocrisy of the upper classes, as exemplified by the Bailiff's poetess wife, who applauds the simple life of poor country people, or the Bailiff's son, whose social-welfare schemes help him but undermine the crofters. Laxness is not easy on Bjartur, who is bloody-minded in the extreme, but he is tender enough to compose a poem to his exiled adoptive daughter, and bold enough to engrave a simple marker in honor of the misunderstood ghoul who has haunted his farm and family. He's a figure that Snorri Sturluson would have recognized.Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an alternatePaperbackedition.",

Having lived in China for a decade now, fluent in Mandarin and working as a correspondent in Beijing, Hessler displays impressive knowledge, research and personal encounters as he brings the country's peoples, foibles and history into sharp focus. He frames his narrative with short chapters about Chinese artifacts: the underground city being excavated at Anyang; the oracle bones of the title (\"inscriptions on shell and bone\" considered the earliest known writing in East Asia); and he pays particular attention to how language affects culture, often using Chinese characters and symbols to make a point.A talented writer and journalist, Hessler has courage&mdash;he's undercover at the Falun Gong demonstrations in Tiananmen Square and in the middle of anti-American protests in Nanjing after the Chinese embassy bombings in Belgrade&mdash;and a sense of humor (the Nanjing rioters attack a statue of Ronald McDonald since Nanjing has no embassies). The tales of his Fuling students' adventures in the new China's boom towns; the Uighur trader, an ethnic minority from China's western border, who gets asylum after entering the U.S. withjiade(false) documents; the oracle bones scholar Chen Mengjia, who committed suicide during the Cultural Revolution&mdash;all add a seductive element of human interest.There's little information available in China, we learn, but Hessler gets the stories that no one talks about and delivers them in a personal study that informs, entertains and mesmerizes.

The game doesn't approach the epic scale of either of those titles, but  once you get used to its smaller scale, the various charms of this game do  become obvious.The game involves you, as Mario's brother Luigi, trying to exorcise a haunted  mansion of ghosts by sucking them into a vacuum cleaner. It sounds easier than  the previous cinematic attempts by theGhostbustersand theCatholic Church, but it's not.  The complications and cleverness of the game manifest in the use of light and  shadow. Many ghosts cannot be seen unless you reveal their shadows or manipulate  the objects in a room to make them appear. These imaginative--but never  frustrating--puzzles add to the otherwise simplistic process of catching the  smaller ghosts by freezing them with a beam of light and sucking them up with  your Hoover backpack.It's only a minor classic, butLuigi's Mansiondoes show off some off the  GameCube's graphic effects and provides a game the whole family can enjoy.

Even as a very young child I understood the extent of his suffering and struggled to fathom how something so terrible could happen to a beloved grandparent.&nbsp; And I am sure my interest in the women of that generation--the first generation of women to go to war in modern times--is rooted in memories of the ladies of a certain age who lived in our neighborhood as I was growing up. They were typical of that generation, very independent women who had remained single due to circumstance, for the men they might have married had been lost to war.So, to the question of writing about contemporary Britain--I think I'll find out more about my level of comfort with modern times when I pull that contemporary novel off the back burner. In the meantime, there's so much that I want to explore from the past, though when I immerse myself in the preparatory research for my books, I am always reminded of the old adage: \"history repeats itself.\"Smith: You and I both started as novelists rather later than is perhaps usual. Is that a good thing or a bad thing?Winspear: When I was sixteen I rather precociously announced that I would write my first novel by the time I was thirty--it seemed such a formidable age of adulthood, I suppose. Of course, thirty came and went with no novel to show for it, and in the meantime I was becoming more and more interested in nonfiction writing.&nbsp; I was in my late thirties by the time I made a real commitment to getting my work published, and I concentrated more on essays, articles and other creative nonfiction. I believe my writing at that time represented something of an apprenticeship in that I was really working at the craft of writing, of building my understanding of framing a scene, of bringing the reader along with metaphor, and with developing scenes that were something like the literary equivalent of a zoom lens on the camera; I was trying to find out what worked in terms of drawing the reader in and placing them at the center of the action. Though I had no plans to write a novel until the idea forMaisie Dobbsactually came to me, upon reflection it seems as if I had been preparing for the task with my literary cross-training in the same way that an athlete prepares for the big event.&nbsp;I believe the journey to becoming a writer is one that is very personal to the individual and is neither good or bad--it's just what it is. There are times when I think it would have been so much more fun to have started writing fiction earlier, but had that happened, the stars might not have aligned to bring the character of Maisie Dobbs into my life.&nbsp; And I think that in embarking upon being novelists in our middle years, we&rsquo;ve probably both brought something to our work that we might not have been able to offer in younger days, either due to other responsibilities, or simply who we were at the time (though having said that, I am sure your readers wish the wonderful Precious Ramotswe had been created many years before you decided to writeThe No 1 Ladies' Detective Agency!)Smith: Have you written anything about Maisie that you would like to unwrite?Winspear: No, not at all, although I should add that I have never gone back and re-read any of my books, a prospect I find rather daunting.&nbsp; Of course, I dip back into the books to check a point here and there, but I have never read the books from beginning to end--if I had done so, I might have a whole list of things that cause me to shudder.Smith: Do you think that transplanting oneself--in your case from the UK to California--helps one as a writer?Winspear: Another very good question!&nbsp; Many years ago, during a visit to New York, I went along to an exhibit at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue--it was called \"Writers in Exile.\"&nbsp; The focus was on writers who lived in a place other than the land of their birth, \"by will, or by compunction.\" I spent ages going around the exhibit taking copious notes, and remember it left me with a real sense of the power of being transplanted, whether by one&rsquo;s own choice, or by circumstance; and I have to say, I often think of it when people ask me if being here in California contributes to my work as a writer--and it does. To give an example, I can immerse myself in the time and place about which I write--Britain from the Great War on up to the 1930s--and I am not distracted by British life as it is today. Yes, of course, there is contemporary life here in California, but it is different (the way people speak, interact, shop, travel, work, etc.) so I can draw a firm line between life here and the world about which I write.&nbsp; I should confess that one of my recent challenges came when I started writingThe Mapping of Love and Death. The opening is set in California in 1914, so I had to ensure that my knowledge of that region today did not seep into the story. To that end I immersed myself in old books about the region, and managed to procure some vintage photographs to pin on the wall so that the past was very much with me as I wrote.When I write, the time and place of my imagination becomes very distilled, very sharp in my mind's eye. In terms of the series featuring Maisie Dobbs, it has definitely helped to be living here; when I sit down at my desk to write, I step from my world into her world, and I&rsquo;m aware of nothing else until I stop writing.&nbsp; And when I drag myself back from a morning spent in the smog-enveloped London of the 1930s, it's not bad to be able to walk outside into the garden and warm my bones in the California sun for a while.",
        "0006514006": "Sisterly rivalry is the basis of this fresh, wonderfully vivid retelling of the story of Anne Boleyn. Anne, her sister Mary and their brother George are all brought to the king's court at a young age, as players in their uncle's plans to advance the family's fortunes. Mary, the sweet, blond sister, wins King Henry VIII's favor when she is barely 14 and already married to one of his courtiers. Their affair lasts several years, and she gives Henry a daughter and a son. But her dark, clever, scheming sister, Anne, insinuates herself into Henry's graces, styling herself as his adviser and confidant. Soon she displaces Mary as his lover and begins her machinations to rid him of his wife, Katherine of Aragon. This is only the beginning of the intrigue that Gregory so handily chronicles, capturing beautifully the mingled hate and nearly incestuous love Anne, Mary and George (\"kin and enemies all at once\") feel for each other and the toll their family's ambition takes on them. Mary, the story's narrator, is the most sympathetic of the siblings, but even she is twisted by the demands of power and status; charming George, an able plotter, finally brings disaster on his own head by falling in love with a male courtier. Anne, most tormented of all, is ruthless in her drive to become queen, and then to give Henry a male heir. Rather than settling for a picturesque rendering of court life, Gregory conveys its claustrophobic, all-consuming nature with consummate skill. In the end, Anne's famous, tragic end is offset by Mary's happier fate, but the self-defeating folly of the quest for power lingers longest in the reader's mind.Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an alternatePaperbackedition.",

Fifteen years after Lisa goes missing, her younger brother, Sam, gets a strange phone call that leads him and his girlfriend, Phoebe, to discover a book, supposedly written by the King of the Fairies, that Lisa used as her bible to cross over, and which prompts Sam and Phoebe to meet up with Sam's cousin, Evie, to see if they can figure out what happened to Lisa.

Erdrich's 13th novel, a multigenerational tour de force of sin, redemption, murder and vengeance, finds its roots in the 1911 slaughter of a farming family near Pluto, N.Dak. The family's infant daughter is spared, and a posse forms, incorrectly blames three Indians and lynches them. One, Mooshum Milk, miraculously survives. Over the next century, descendants of both the hanged men and the lynch mob develop relationships that become deeply entangled, and their disparate stories are held together via principal narrator Evelina, Mooshum Milk's granddaughter, who comes of age on an Indian reservation near Pluto in the 1960s and '70s and forms two fateful adolescent crushes: one on bad-boy schoolmate Corwin Peace and one on a nun. Though Evelina doesn't know it, both are descendants of lynch mob members. The plot splinters as Evelina enrolls in college and finds work at a mental asylum; Corwin spirals into a life of crime; and a long-lost violin (its backstory is another beautiful piece of the mosaic) takes on massive significance. Erdrich plays individual narratives off one another, dropping apparently insignificant clues that build to head-slapping revelations as fates intertwine and the person responsible for the 1911 killing is identified.(May)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "B000087H7T": "Early Adopters Pick: March 2003. As the  world's smallest video-game platform, the Game Boy Advance SP is also the first to use a built-in rechargeable battery.Many decried the original Game Boy Advance's reflective LCD screen and its reliance on external light sources. The Game Boy Advance SP's main feature--optional backlighting--fixes this complaint nicely, but it's the wealth of other features that makes this system so surprisingly good.At first look, you might think the SP is a sleek travel alarm clock. When closed, it's just as tall and deep as the original GBA, but only half as wide. Due to its clamshell design, the screen is always protected from everyday scratches. A small button in the center of the console turns on the backlighting element for use in low-light situations, like in a moving car.The SP comes with a well-designed power adapter that recharges a built-in battery; its prongs fold in for easier storage. Our informal tests found that it takes about four hours to fully charge (you can even play it while it's plugged in and charging), and the battery lasts about 11 hours with the backlighting constantly on--your results may vary. Using the backlighting less often will conserve battery power.Withseparately sold  cables, you can connect the Game Boy Advance SP to other GBAs  for multiplayer gaming (above) or to theNintendo GameCube(below) to access secret levels, exchange data, or use other special  features that vary from game to game.The quality of the backlighting is very good. It's bright and clear when looking directly at it, but degraded from other angles. This is only a problem for friends who are watching the screen from over your shoulder.But size, power, and affordability do not come without trade offs. There's no headphone jack here, though Nintendo promises an adapter. The system isn't very loud at its highest volume, and the sound can be turned down to socially acceptable levels. The L and R shoulder buttons are a fraction of the size they were on the GBA, and thus are harder to hit. Also, the reduced size of the SP is slightly less comfortable for adult hands than the GBA, but perhaps more comfortable for smaller hands. The cartridge port placement on the lower part of the console is fine for GBA games, since they are flush with the console body, but older Game Boy Color carts will stick out in a way that takes some getting used to.Open it up and the hinge will seek out a preferred, pre-set angle (about 150 degrees), though you can open it a bit wider or narrower for your own comfort. The hinge stands up well to lateral pressure, and over all, the SP seems just as rugged as its predecessor--which has proven to be very rugged, indeed.--Porter B.

To calm his nerves as he sits in the courtroom, aspiring filmmaker Steve chronicles the proceedings in movie script format.

But there are no guarantees in deep space. Pandora, one of these distant planets, was reported to be rich in untapped mineral wealth, and so drew many hoping to get rich quick, but in the end little was found beyond the scattered ruins of a past alien civilization. With nothing to gain, any who could soon abandoned Pandora, leaving those who remained to deal with the lawlessness of a world gone bust, and the mystery of the long-dead alien civilization. But as chaotic as these times were, there were worse days yet to come. After several years the planet's huge orbit slowly brought it near to its sun and once unknown and horrifying creatures sprang from their long hibernation to terrify the stranded colonists. The only hope of the colonists seems to be a vault discovered in the side of a mountainside, rumored to contain alien technology and secrets about Pandora.

When Irma's&nbsp;mother dies, she warns her 16-year-old daughter that leaving their little Italian village dooms her to die among strangers. A few years later, Irma, frightened of her increasingly lustful father, leaves her village and, armed only with her sewing skills and a small dowry, secures passage on the Servia, where she meets the first in a series of helpful strangers who will color, shape, and add the occasional zest of danger (her face is scarred by the time she disembarks) to her journeys. In America, her friendships with a few determined women--Lula, an African-American cook; Molly, an Irish maid; and Sofia, an Italian nurse--help keep her afloat and moving from a Cleveland sweatshop, through misery and rejuvenation in Chicago, and, finally, to the lush hills in San Francisco. Though some plot turns are played too melodramatically, Irma's adventures and redeeming evolution make this a serious book club contender. (Feb.)(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.  All rights reserved.",
        "0060191872": "Stuart Woods's lean, taut thrillers typically feature a helping of Hollywood glitz along with a suave, sophisticated hero who gets his man and usually the girl, too. His newest is a convincing variation on that formula, featuring an eminently decent, likable hero we've met before in a couple of legal thrillers (Run Before the Wind,Grass Roots). Now Will Lee is a senator from Georgia with somewhat ambivalent aspirations to the presidency; think Bill Clinton with a stronger moral center and a more conventional marriage, to a smart, sexy wife named Kate, who happens to be a high-ranking CIA executive. When the sitting vice president, who's slated to be the party's standard-bearer in the upcoming election, tells Will in confidence that he's just been diagnosed with early Alzheimer's disease, Will decides to make the run of the title. That's good news for an imprisoned former CIA agent (think Aldrich Ames) who was Kate Lee's mentor in the agency; he knows his only possible chance for a pardon is Will's election, and he has enough dirt on the senator's rivals to blackmail them into getting out of the way. Throw in a right-wing fanatic with a long-standing grudge against Will and a determination to assassinate him before he can make it to the White House, and you have all the ingredients for a successful run at the bestseller list. But while Woods's many fans will cheer for both the author and his protagonist, that may not be enough to vault this one to the top; Will doesn't seem to have the requisite fire in the belly, and neither does Woods in what is ultimately a fairly tepid read.--Jane Adams",

A recovering alcoholic recently reassigned to the Norwegian Security Service, Insp. Harry Hole begins tracking Sverre Olsen, a vicious neo-Nazi who escaped prosecution on a technicality. But what starts as a quest to put Olsen behind bars soon explodes into a race to prevent an assassination. As Hole struggles to stay one step ahead of Olsen and his gang of skinheads, Nesb&oslash; takes the reader back to WWII, as Norwegians fighting for Hitler wage a losing battle on the Eastern front. When the two story lines finally collide, it's up to Hole to stop a man hell-bent on carrying out the deadly plan he hatched half a century ago in the trenches. Perfectly paced and painfully suspenseful, this crime novel illuminates not only Norway's alleged Nazi ties but also its present skinhead subculture. Readers will delight in Hole, a laconic hero as doggedly stubborn as Connelly's Harry Bosch, and yet with a prickly appeal all his own.(Dec.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0061009059": "Stephanie Plum is so smart, so honest, and so funny that her  narrative charm could drive a documentary on termites. But this tough gal from  New Jersey, an unemployed discount lingerie buyer, has a much more  interesting story to tell: She has to say that her Miata has been repossessed and  that she's so poor at the moment that she just drank her last bottle of beer  for breakfast. She has to say that her only chance out of her present rut  is her repugnant cousin Vinnie and his bail-bond business. She has to say  that she blackmailed Vinnie into giving her a bail-bond recovery job worth  $10,000 (for a murder suspect), even though she doesn't own a gun and has never apprehended a person in her life. And she has to say that the guy she  has to get, Joe Morelli, is the same creep who charmed away her teenage virginity behind the pastry case in the Trenton bakery where she worked after school.If that hard-luck story doesn't sound compelling enough, Stephanie's several unsuccessful attempts at pulling in Joe make a downright  hilarious and suspenseful tale of murder and deceit. Along the way, several more outlandish (but unrelentingly real) characters join the story,  including Benito Ramirez, a champion boxer who seems to be following Stephanie  Plum wherever she goes.Janet Evanovich shares an authentic feel for the streets of Trenton in  her debut mystery (she developed her talents in a string of romance novels before creating Ms. Plum), and her tough, frank, and funny first-person narrator offers a winning mix of vulgarity and sensitivity. Evanovich  is certainly among the best of the new voices to emerge in the mystery  field of the 1990s.--Patrick O'Kelley",

But it may be too late.Ignited by the Master&rsquo;s horrific plan, a war erupts between Old and New World vampires, each vying for total control.

What motivated you to write a novel?Del Toro:Well, it&rsquo;s a different challenge, but I've always written short stories and then, in my film work, storylines for movies (the storyline is a slightly \"freer\" form than screenplay writing) I have published some of my short stories in the past and it is my secret dream to write shivery tales for young readers. My favorite author in that sense isRoald Dahlwho mixed it free-style between the grotesque and the magical. I love the short story form as a reader but if a novel has a terse structure I find it far more immersive and fulfilling. Nevertheless some of my favorite authors, Borges,Quiroga,Saki, etc. are masters of the short story form. The novel grew out of appetite and scope.Q:You are one of the most extraordinarily imaginative and creative thinkers working in the arts today. What were some of the influences that have contributed to your success? Do you have any kind of a muse?Del Toro:Curiously enough I regularly draw more inspiration from painters and books than I do from other films.  Painters like Carlos Schwabe, Odilon Redon, Fliecien Rops, Bocklin, Freud, Bacon, Thomas Cole and many others, never fail to excite me and in the book front there are just as many authors...Dickens, does the trick every time as doesWilde,Rulfo,Quiroga, etc.Q:Many of your movies have centered on fantastical characters. Why did you choose to write your first novel about vampires?Del Toro:All of my life I&rsquo;ve been fascinated by them but always from a Naturalist's point of view.Cronos, my first movie, wanted to be a rephrasing of the genre&mdash;I love the rephrasing of an old myth.  When I tackledBlade II, I approached it with a myriad of ideas about Vampire Biology but only a few of those made it into the film. Tonally, the movie needed to be an action film and some of the biological stuff was too disturbing already...  I love the idea of the biological, the divine and the evolutionary angles to explain the origin and function of the Vampire genus. Some of my favorite books about Vampirism are treatises on Vampiric \"fact&rdquo;--books by Bernard J Hurwood,Augustin Camet, andMontague Summers.Q:There are many stories, movies, and even a television show involving vampires. The Strain Trilogy uses the idea that vampires are a plague, and that the lead hunter is a scientist from the Centers for Disease Control. What was your inspiration for this twist?Del Toro:When I was a kid I lovedThe Night Stalkerand I fell in love with the idea Matheson and Rice posited, of exploring a creature of such powerful stature through the point of view of a common worker, a man used to deal with things in a procedural way. \"Just another day at the job...\".Q:How did you and Chuck Hogan come together to write The Strain Trilogy? How does your collaboration work?Del Toro:It was a true collaboration. I had created a \"bible\" for the book. It contained most of the structural ideas and characters and Chuck then took his pass on it and invented new characters and ideas. Fet (one of my favorite characters) was completely invented by him. And then I did my pass, writing new chapters or heavily editing his pass, and then he did a pass on my pass and so on and so forth. This is the way I have co-written in the past.  I loved Chuck's style and ideas from reading his books and I specifically wanted him as a partner because he had a strong sense of reality and had NEVER written a horror book. I knew we would complete each other in the creation of this book. What surprised me is that he came up with some gruesome moments all on his own! He revealed himself to be a rather disturbed man!A Q&amp;A with Hammett Award-winner Chuck HoganQ:What most surprised you about working with Guillermo Del Toro? Has working with him impacted your own work? In your former career as a video store clerk, did you ever in your wildest dreams imagine working on a project like this&mdash;with a legend like Del Toro?Hogan:I'd never co-authored anything, nor had I published a true work of horror before, and here I was embarking on an epic trilogy with a master of the genre.  I probably should have been more intimidated--yet I felt an immediate kinship with the material, as well as true excitement at the challenge of bringing the story to life, both of which carried me through.   Guillermo is a daunting first audience, and yet an incredibly generous collaborator.  Not to mention an amazing resource:  it's just fun to have to ask him a question&mdash;say, about why the vampires run hot instead of cold&mdash;know that, not only will he take me through their intricate biology, but he will embroider the account with corroborating examples from the field of entomology, marine life, and some arcane fact about the function of human blood platelets.Q:The Town,Devils in Exile, andThe Killing Moon, probe the dark side of human nature. What draws you to this theme, and to the genre of suspense?Hogan:Crime and horror are both genres of existentialism, and I am drawn to stories of man at his extremes, of people who find themselves tested, haunted, threatened.  I believe a writer should challenge himself in his work just as he challenges the characters in his story&mdash;that anything less would be inauthentic and dishonest.  What I love aboutThe Strainis that the journey of the story takes this maxim and multiplies it by one thousand.",
        "0060588284": "In this beautiful picture book, winner of the 2005 Caldecott Medal,Kevin Henkes, captures the sweet, sometimes slapstick struggle of Kitten, who sees her first full moon and thinks it's a bowl of milk in the sky.Any child who has yearned for anything will understand how much Kitten wants that elusive bowl of milk. Readers will giggle as she tries to lick the faraway moon and gets a bug on her tongue, or leaps to catch it and falls down the stairs. In an effective refrain, the narrator repeats, \"Still, there was the little bowl of milk, just waiting.\" The winning combination here is the simplicity and humor of the story, paired with gorgeous black-and-white illustrations with thick black lines (mirrored by the thick bold sans-serif font) and shades of grey that are as luminous as a moonlit night should be. Full-moon circles and ovals appear throughout the design: white circle full moons on the endpapers, elliptical flowers by the porch, white circles of firefly light, oval pads on Kitten's paws, and her big round eyes (especially when surprised and soaking wet). Children will love Kitten's quest and ensuing comedy of errors, but what they will love even more is that there's an actual bowl of milk waiting on the porch for Kitten. (Preschool)--Karin Snelson",

        "0020519109": "Here, for a change, is a fish tale that actually does honor to the  author. In factThe Old Man and the Searevived Ernest Hemingway's career, which was foundering under the weight of such postwar stinkers asAcross the River and into the Trees. It also led directly to his receipt of the Nobel Prize in 1954 (an award Hemingway gladly accepted, despite his earlier observation that \"no son of a bitch that ever won the Nobel Prize ever wrote anything worth reading afterwards\"). A half century later, it's still easy to see why. This tale of an aged Cuban fisherman going head-to-head (or hand-to-fin) with a magnificent marlin encapsulates Hemingway's favorite motifs of physical and moral challenge. Yet Santiago is too old and infirm to partake of the gun-toting machismo that disfigured much of the author's later work: \"The brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its reflection on the tropic sea were on his cheeks. The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords.\" Hemingway's style, too, reverts to those superb snapshots of perception that won him his initial fame:Just before it was dark, as they passed a great island of Sargasso weed that heaved and swung in the light sea as though the ocean were making love with something under a yellow blanket, his small line was taken by a dolphin. He saw it first when it jumped in the air, true gold in the last of the sun and bending and flapping wildly in the air.If a younger Hemingway had written this novella, Santiago most likely would have towed the enormous fish back to port and posed for a triumphal photograph--just as the author delighted in doing, circa 1935. Instead his prize gets devoured by a school of sharks. Returning with little more than a skeleton, he takes to his bed and, in the very last line, cements his identification with his creator: \"The old man was dreaming about the lions.\" Perhaps there's some allegory of art and experience floating around in there somewhere--butThe Old Man and the Seawas, in any case, the last great catch of Hemingway's career.--James Marcus--This text refers to an alternatePaperbackedition.",

Despite the female bonding, this dark, violent novel is more evocative of Gogol or Dostoyevsky than Thelma and Louise. When Yayoi, the youngest and prettiest of the women, strangles her philandering gambler husband with his own belt in an explosion of rage, she turns instinctively for help to her co-worker Masako, an older and wiser woman whose own family life has fallen apart in less dramatic fashion. To help her cut up and get rid of the dead body, Masako recruits Yoshie and Kuniko, two fellow factory workers caught up in other kinds of domestic traps. In Snyder's smoothly unobtrusive translation, all of Kirino's characters are touching and believable. And even when the action stretches to include a slick loan shark from Masako's previous life and a pathetically lost and lonely man of mixed Japanese and Brazilian parentage, the gritty realism of everyday existence in the underbelly of Japan's consumer society comes across with pungent force.

        "0099458322": "The opening pages of a Haruki Murakami novel can be like the view out an airplane window onto tarmac. But at some point between page three and  fifteen--it's page thirteen inKafka On The Shore--the deceptively placid narrative lifts off, and you find yourself breaking through clouds at a tilt, no longer certain where the plane is headed or if the laws of flight even apply.Joining the rich literature of runaways,Kafka On The Shorefollows the solitary, self-disciplined schoolboy Kafka Tamura as he hops a bus from Tokyo to the randomly chosen town of Takamatsu, reminding himself at each step that he has to be \"the world&#xB9;s toughest fifteen-year-old.\" He finds a secluded private library in which to spend his days--continuing his impressive self-education--and is befriended by a clerk and the mysteriously remote head librarian, Miss Saeki, whom he fantasizes may be his long-lost mother. Meanwhile, in a second, wilder narrative spiral, an elderly Tokyo man named Nakata veers from his calm routine by murdering a stranger. An unforgettable character, beautifully delineated by Murakami, Nakata can speak with cats but cannot read or write, nor explain the forces drawing him toward Takamatsu and the other characters.To say that the fantastic elements ofKafka On The Shoreare complicated and never fully resolved is not to suggest that the novel fails. Although it may not live up to Murakami's masterfulThe Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, Nakata and Kafka's fates keep the reader enthralled to the final pages, and few will complain about the loose threads at the end.--Regina Marler--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

        "0062231707": "*Starred Review* Soon after arriving at Princeton University, where she continues to teach, Oates completed Bellefleur (1980), launching a series of sly gothic novels. One manuscript, The Crosswicks Horror, was left unfinished, and Oates has now resurrected it as a lush, arch, and blistering fusion of historical fact, supernatural mystery, and devilish social commentary. High-strung and ambitious Woodrow Wilson is the president of Princeton. Anxious over festering conflicts and appalled by what he learns about his distant relative and prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; after the nearby lynching of an African American man and his pregnant sister, Wilson seeks advice from retired Reverend Winslow Slade, who would rather think about the upcoming wedding of his granddaughter, Annabel. But this fair maiden is in danger of falling under the spell of a handsome stranger with otherworldly eyes. As an elite WASP enclave finds itself caught in the grip of inexplicable terror, readers will be bewitched by a fantastically dramatic, supremely imaginative plot rife with ghosts, vampires, demons, and human folly. Oates brings her nightshade humor and extraordinary fluency in eroticism and violence, American history and literature (her magnetizing characters include Mark Twain, Jack London, and Upton Sinclair) to this piercing novel of the devastating toll of repression and prejudice, sexism and class warfare. A diabolically enthralling and subversive literary mash-up.

And you will never discover how serious it was until the stakes are raised horribly high,\" Lewis writes. \"Nothing will shake a man--or at any rate a man like me--out of his merely verbal thinking and his merely notional beliefs.

Only under torture does he discover it himself.\" This is the book that inspired the filmShadowlands, but it is more wrenching, more revelatory, and more real than the movie.

        "0062024027": "A Q&amp;A with Author Veronica RothQ:What advice would you offer to young aspiring writers, who long to live a success story like your own?Roth:One piece of advice I have is: Want something else more than success. Success is a lovely thing, but your desire to say something, your worth, and your identity shouldn&rsquo;t rely on it, because it&rsquo;s not guaranteed and it&rsquo;s not permanent and it&rsquo;s not sufficient. So work hard, fall in love with the writing&mdash;the characters, the story, the words, the themes&mdash;and make sure that you are who you are regardless of your life circumstances. That way, when the good things come, they don&rsquo;t warp you, and when the bad things hit you, you don&rsquo;t fall apart.Q:You&rsquo;re a young author--is it your current adult perspective or not-so-recent teenage perspective that brought about the factions in the development of this story? Do you think that teens or adults are more likely to fit into categories in our current society?Roth:Other aspects of my identity have more to do with the factions than my age. The faction system reflects my beliefs about human nature&mdash;that we can make even something as well-intentioned as virtue into an idol, or an evil thing. And that virtue as an end unto itself is worthless to us. I did spend a large portion of my adolescence trying to be as &ldquo;good&rdquo; as possible so that I could prove my worth to the people around me, to myself, to God, to everyone. It&rsquo;s only now that I&rsquo;m a little older that I realize I am unable to be truly &ldquo;good&rdquo; and that it&rsquo;s my reasons for striving after virtue that need adjustment more than my behavior. In a sense,Divergentis me writing through that realization&mdash;everyone in Beatrice&rsquo;s society believes that virtue is the end, the answer. I think that&rsquo;s a little twisted.I think we all secretly love and hate categories&mdash;love to get a firm hold on our identities, but hate to be confined&mdash;and I never loved and hated them more than when I was a teenager. That said: Though we hear a lot about high school cliques, I believe that adults categorize each other just as often, just in subtler ways. It is a dangerous tendency of ours. And it begins in adolescence.Q:If you could add one more faction to the world withinDivergent, what would it be?Roth:I tried to construct the factions so that they spanned a wide range of virtues. Abnegation, for example, includes five of the traditional &ldquo;seven heavenly virtues:&rdquo; chastity, temperance, charity, patience, and humility. That said, it would be interesting to have a faction centered on industriousness, in which diligence and hard work are valued most, and laziness is not allowed. They would be in constant motion, and would probably be happy to take over for the factionless. And hard-working people can certainly take their work too far, as all the factions do with their respective virtues. I&rsquo;m not sure what they would wear, though. Overalls, probably.Q:What do you think are the advantages, if any, to the society you&rsquo;ve created inDivergent?Roth:All the advantages I see only seem like advantages to me because I live in our current society. For example, the members of their society don&rsquo;t focus on certain things: race, religion, sexual orientation, political affiliation, etc. I mean, a world in which you look different from the majority and no one minds? That sounds good to me. But when I think about it more, I realize that they&rsquo;re doing the exact same thing we do, but with different criteria by which to distinguish ourselves from others. Instead of your skin color, it&rsquo;s the color of your shirt that people assess, or the results of your aptitude test. Same problem, different system.Q:What book are you currently reading and how has it changed you, if at all?Roth:I recently finishedImaginary Girlsby Nova Ren Suma, which I would call &ldquo;contemporary with a paranormal twist,&rdquo; or something to that effect. It&rsquo;s about a girl whose sister has a powerful kind of magnetism within the confines of a particular town, and how their love for each other breaks some things apart and puts other things back together. It was refreshing to read a young adult book that is about sisterhood instead of romance. It&rsquo;s one of those books that makes you love a character and then hate a character and then love them again&mdash;that shows you that people aren&rsquo;t all good or all bad, but somewhere in between.Imaginary Girlsgave me a lot to think about, and the writing was lovely, which I always love to see.",

Those parts ofMedium Raw--more of a collection of essays than a streamlined narrative--that seemed to grow out of that celebrity, such as Bourdain's feuds with food critics and celebrity chefs, impressed reviewers the least. But they still found much to savor, particularly Bourdain's biting personality, his own humorous self-deprecation, his ability to bring out the unknown elements of the restaurant industry, particularly the kitchen and service staff who might otherwise be ignored, and, not least of all, the well-written (if often vulgar) and compelling stories. In the end, thoughMedium Rawwill best be appreciated by foodies, it is \"generally an entertaining read, compelling more for [Bourdain's] passion than his mean streak\" (Kansas City Star).",
        "B00006I02Z": "In many ways, creating a sequel toHalf-Lifeis an unenviable task.  After all, the goal is to craft not just any ordinary game, but an improvement to a title that is widely considered to be the high water mark for first person shooters.  Fortunately, Valve does not disappoint on their sophomore effort.Half-Life 2picks up exactly where its predecessor leaves off, with gamers stepping once more into Gordon Freeman's HVAC suit as he awakes at some indeterminate time in the future, now apparently in the employ of the mysterious G-Man.  Humanity has been sold out to alien forces, and your job is to escape their thrall and lead the resistance to victory.HL2's key successes are in a few critical areas, the first of which is the new physics & graphics engine, called Source.  People and objects fall, fly, tip over, float, and break in an extraordinarily realistic fashion, and in-game puzzles often require you to use simple applications of physics to progress. Second, an elaborate facial structure system coupled with excellent voice acting make for some of the most believably human NPCs in gaming history.  This is no small thing; you will find yourself actually caring about the characters who surround you, even those that are normally regarded as cannon fodder.  Third, the level design exhibits a subtle brilliance, which frequently fools you into feeling like you're making your way through an organic environment and not a forced linear path.  These elements combine to form one of the most truly immersive experiences ever captured on a PC.This gaming bliss comes at a cost, however.  If your computer isn't running the latest and greatest hardware, you may find yourself turning down a lot of the slick graphics to keep the machine from choking.  Also, at the time of this writing the only two bundled multiplayer games are a barely updated version ofCounter-StrikeandHL2 DeathMatch.Counter-Strike: Sourceis every bit as fun as the original, but the DeathMatch is lackluster and contains only a handful of uninspired maps.Overall,Half-Life 2is a smashing success, every bit worthy of the prestige and respect that the franchise has been awarded.  This is absolutely a game that every computer gaming enthusiast is going to want to have in their collection.-- Jon \"Safety Monkey\" GroverPros:Advanced graphics and physics system provide highly immersive experienceBelievable, expressive non-player charactersFun, realistic level designCons:Requires a very fast computer to play with all bells & whistles onDeathMatch mode has few maps and is not terribly entertaining",

The people of Haven City have grown to distrust Jak's dark powers, and as rumors boil of Jak's ties with Krew and Kor, the city blames Jak for its current woeful circumstances. When the palace is destroyed by a surprise Metal Head attack, even Ashelin cannot protect Jak as the High Council's power broker, Count Veger, forces Jak into banishment to the desolate Wasteland.

        "B0002A6CQ4": "The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect. It looks too good to be trueSound:Great voice acting, stress-inducing music, and disturbing sound effects combine to create the perfect atmospherePlayability:The controls are fashioned beautifully, boss fights are ingenious, and the popping of heads is immensely rewardingEntertainment:Hard to put down even after you've beaten it twiceReplay:Moderately HighRated:10 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:Some games are simply destined to become milestones in gaming history, and Resident Evil 4 is one of them. Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it. Capcom has managed to create a game that is a complete reinvention of the series &#8211; even the entire genre &#8211; without losing anything that Resident Evil fans expect. Perfectly balancing elements of horror, subtlety, and wit with explosive action and over-the-top thrills, playing RE 4 feels like living one of the most epic films you've ever seen. Gorgeous to look at, a dream to control, and filled with some of the most exciting moments you've experienced in a game, Resident Evil 4 is stellar on every level. It goes without saying that it's the best in the series, the best survival horror game yet, and simply one of the best games ever made.Rated:10 out of 10Editor:Jeremy ZossSubscribe to Game Informer--Amazon.com",

He meets with some initial success, beheading second-rate magician Kasabian (whose head becomes Stark's smart-mouthed sidekick), but he can't find Faim. Instead he encounters Homeland Security agents, a near-psychotic angel and some odd nonhuman, nonangelic beings called the kissi. Darkly atmospheric settings, such as a posh gentlemen's club where angels are tortured in an attempt to bring about Armageddon, bring this violent fantasy into sharp, compelling focus.(Aug.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He witnesses everything from group orgies to violent funeral ceremonies. Despite the language and cultural barriers, Ibn Fadlan is welcomed into the clan. The leader of the group, Buliwyf (who can communicate in Latin) takes Fadlan under his wing.Without warning, the chieftain is ordered to haul his warriors back to Scandinavia to save his people from the &quot;monsters of the mist.&quot; Ibn Fadlan follows the clan and must rise to the occasion in the battle of his life.--Gina Kaysen--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

There they uncover a secret world in the midst of violent upheaval, a world full of warring creatures, peaceable mystics, and powerful figures with the darkest intentions. And what begins as a rescue mission becomes something much bigger as the two friends find themselves entwined in a struggle for the very freedom of this wilderness.A wilderness the locals call Wildwood.Wildwoodis a spellbinding tale full of wonder, danger, and magic that juxtaposes the thrill of a secret world and modern city life. Original and fresh yet steeped in classic fantasy, this is a novel that could have only come from the imagination of Colin Meloy, celebrated for his inventive and fantastic storytelling as the lead singer of the Decemberists. With dozens of intricate and beautiful illustrations by award-winning artist Carson Ellis,Wildwoodis truly a new classic for the twenty-first century.AWildwoodPlaylist by Colin Meloy &amp; Carson Ellis\"Ramble On\"by Led ZeppelinColin Meloy: I remember reading an interview with Evan Dando from the Lemonheads right around the time the first Lord of the Rings movie came out, bemoaning the fact that the director hadn&rsquo;t included asingleZeppelin song in the movie. I tend to agree; I mean, how rad would it&rsquo;ve been after that dramatic ending inThe Return of the King, with all its royal celebrations and slo-mo montages&mdash;the screen goes black and those monster riffs of &ldquo;Immigrant Song&rdquo; kick in? Mind-blowing. So much incredible music in the 60s and 70s was directly fueled by mid-century fantasy fiction, something thatWildwoodowes much to; I feel it would be deeply remiss here not to include a little Zepp.\"Marching Song\"by Esben and the WitchColin Meloy: That said, when I was deep in my preadolescent reverie of fantasy and sci-fi, my friends and I would meet every weekend at someone&rsquo;s house to play Dungeons &amp; Dragons. There. Confession made. And as everyone knows, the best Dungeon Masters always partnered up their biggest action scenarios with music. While I think it may have been de rigueur to blast Zeppelin or Hawkwind for some folks, I considered myself to be somewhat of a sophisticate. Joy Division was perfect music for a slow, suspenseful crawl through a gelatinous cube-infested grotto. The Legendary Pink Dots added an extra dimension to a party&rsquo;s first encounter with some weird, reclusive nemesis in a castle tower. An Enchantress might appear to &ldquo;Under Ice&rdquo; by Kate Bush or anything from Siouxsie&rsquo;s output. When I first heard this song from Brighton, England&rsquo;s Esben and the Witch (even the name is evocative of those days) I imagined a new generation of over-imaginative ten-year-olds pairing their fantastical ramblings with the drowning rains and empty plains of this song.\"Take It Easy\"by Hopeton LewisColin Meloy: Switching gears, here. Rocksteady, a kind of precursor to the reggae explosion of the 70s, was a beautiful, thoughtful, random amalgam of classic R&amp;B and traditional Jamaican rhythms. It&rsquo;s clearly the kind of music that is birthed out of necessity; a bunch of poor kids in the slums of Kingston figuring out for themselves how to re-create the sounds that they were hearing over crappy radio speakers: Sam Cooke, Ben E. King, and Sam &amp; Dave. And what came out wasn&rsquo;tquitethe same, but beautiful and weird and extraordinary in its own right. All this to say: I think that rocksteady music is the music of true enjoyment, the aural equivalent of a slice of bacon, and a rocksteady party was the kind of party I imagined Prue&rsquo;s parents would throw to celebrate Mac and Prue&rsquo;s joyful return. And I&rsquo;ll bet that Prue&rsquo;s dad dug deep for some Lewis sides&mdash;maybe he even had them on 45.\"Tam Lin\"by Fairport ConventionColin Meloy:  My 60s Brit Folk obsession is fairly well documented, but I thought I&rsquo;d be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t include an old folk song in this list. This one, in particular, features a forbidding forest and an evil fairy queen and a pair of star-crossed lovers. Clocking in just north of seven minutes, it&rsquo;s as immersive and complete a narrative as a song can hope to retell.\"Jar of Hearts\"by Christina PerriCarson Ellis: I love Sibylle Baier&rsquo;s mournful songs and I listened to them a lot when I was working onWildwood, especially during the rainy months. Portland winters can be dreary and sometimes gloomy music is the best thing for them. This isn&rsquo;t my very favorite song of hers, but I chose it because, you know, the title.\"I Lost Something in the Hills\"by Sibylle BaierCarson Ellis: The intensity and focused passion of this song makes me think of my darling Jack, along with the references to heaven and hell, a favorite theme of his.\"My Lovely Elizabeth\"by S.E. RogieCarson Ellis: Wildwood has a lot of illustrations&mdash;85 in all&mdash;and it was hard work getting them done. Man, I love to draw but at times this project was exhausting. At times it was downright grueling. Fortunately, I have some remedies for this: taking a walk always helps, as does yoga, as does S. E. Rogie.\"Katie Cruel\"by Karen DaltonCarson Ellis: This is a spooky traditional song that dates back to the Revolutionary War. LikeWildwood&rsquo;s villainess, Alexandra, Katie Cruel roams the forest and the &ldquo;bogs and mire,&rdquo; jilted and in exile. This is a good song to listen to while walking in Forest Park, the real woods that were the inspiration forWildwood&rsquo;s Impassable Wilderness. Or while walking in any misty, quiet forest where beards of moss hang from the gnarled branches of dead trees and there&rsquo;s little sign of civilization. You can imagine that around any bend you might find the solitary hut of Katie Cruel, a little curl of smoke drifting up from its chimney and the sound of her high lonesome banjo coming from within. I also love this song&rsquo;s beautiful, totally unhinged chorus:Oh that I was where I would be,Then I would be where I am not,Here I am where I must beGo where I would, I cannot.\"Over the Hills and Far Away\"by Led ZeppelinCarson Ellis: I&rsquo;m a longtime Led Zeppelin fan and this song, in addition to having a fitting title, was another one I loved when I was Prue&rsquo;s age. I first heard it around the time I read The Hobbit, and I thought its medieval vagabond vibe was awesome. I&rsquo;m also a sucker for a song that starts with a pretty guitar part and then gets crazy. As an adult I tend to like Zeppelin&rsquo;s earlier, bluesier stuff better but, as a kid, I loved the Middle Earth-ish stuff and &ldquo;Over the Hills and Far Away&rdquo; was my jam.A Look InsideWildwoodClick on the images below to open larger versions.

        "0060537639": "A former submarine commander in Britain's Royal Navy, Menzies must enjoy doing battle. The amateur historian's lightly footnoted, heavily speculative re-creation of little-known voyages made by Chinese ships in the early 1400s goes far beyond what most experts in and outside of China are willing to assert and will surely set tongues wagging. According to Menzies's brazen but dull account of the Middle Kingdom's exploits at sea, Magellan, Dias, da Gama, Cabral and Cook only \"discovered\" lands the Chinese had already visited, and they sailed with maps drawn from Chinese charts. Menzies alleges that the Chinese not only discovered America, but also established colonies here long before Columbus set out to sea. Because China burned the records of its historic expeditions led by Zheng He, the famed eunuch admiral and the focus of this account, Menzies is forced to defend his argument by compiling a tedious package of circumstantial evidence that ranges from reasonable to ridiculous. While the book does contain some compelling claims-for example, that the Chinese were able to calculate longitude long before Western explorers-drawn from Menzies's experiences at sea, his overall credibility is undermined by dubious research methods. In just one instance, when confounded by the derivation of cryptic words on a Venetian map, Menzies first consults an expert at crossword puzzles rather than an etymologist. Such an approach to scholarship, along with a promise of more proof to come in the paperback edition, casts a shadow of doubt over Menzies's discoveries. 32 pages of color illus., 27 maps and diagrams.

Covering the years from 1975 to 1979, the story moves from the deaths of multiple family members to the forced separation of the survivors, leading ultimately to the reuniting of much of the family, followed by marriages and immigrations. The brutality seems unending--beatings, starvation, attempted rape, mental cruelty--and yet the narrator (a young girl) never stops fighting for escape and survival. Sad and courageous, her life and the lives of her young siblings provide quite a powerful example of how war can so deeply affect children--especially a war in which they are trained to be an integral part of the armed forces. For anyone interested in Cambodia's recent history, this book shares a valuable personal view of events.--Jill Lightner",
        "0062060619": "Amazon Best Books of the Month, March 2012: Betrayal, ardor, war, and prophecies--inThe Song of Achilles, author Madeline Miller brings together everything I love aboutThe Iliadwithout the labor of epic poetry.  In this new twist on the Trojan War story, Patroclus and Achilles are the quintessential mismatched pair--a mortal underdog exiled in shame and a glorious demigod revered by all--but what would a novel of ancient Greece be without star-crossed love? Miller includes other good tragic bits--foreknowledge of death, ruthless choices that pit pride and reputation against the lives of innocents, the folly of men and gods--and through her beautiful writing my spine chilled in the presence of Achilles&#x2019; mother, the sea goddess Thetis, and I became a bystander in the battlefield of Troy awash with blood, exaltation, and despair.The Song of Achillesinfuses the essence of Homer with modern storytelling in a combination that is utterly absorbing and gratifying--I can&#x2019;t wait to see what Miller tackles next.--Seira WilsonGregory Maguire Interviews Madeline MillerGregory Maguire is the best-selling author ofConfessions of an Ugly Stepsister,Lost,Mirror Mirror,the Wicked Years, a series that includesWicked,Son of a Witch,A Lion Among Men, and most recently,Out of Oz.Gregory Maguire:Ms. Miller, you write with the confidence of the zealously inspired, taking as your material one of the great foundation texts of world literature. In three millennia,The Iliadhas garnered somewhat wider attention thanThe Wizard of Oz, with which I have played, so I have to ask: where do you get the noive? How did you come to dare to take on such a daunting task, and for your first book?Madeline Miller:A little knowledge is a dangerous thing, and in my case it was just dangerous enough to get me started. If I had stopped to ponder, I think I might have been too intimidated. But it helped that Patroclus is such an underdog&mdash;giving him voice felt like standing up for him. I had been intensely frustrated by a number of articles that kept side-stepping the love between him and Achilles, which to me felt so obviously at the story&rsquo;s heart. So I wanted to set the record straight, as I saw it.Maguire:The novel tells the story of the rise, fall and immortalization of the golden Achilles. You approach his famous story from a sideline, that of Patroclus, his bosom companion and lover. Was it hard to keep the mighty arc of legend from overwhelming shadowy Patroclus, and did you write more of him than you ended up using, just to be sure you had him firmly grounded in your mind?Miller:Definitely yes to the second. I actually spent five years writing a first draft of the novel, took a good long look at it, then threw it out and started from scratch. Even though not a word survived, that draft was an essential first step. It helped me understand the story and characters, especially Patroclus, from the inside out.As for the overwhelming legends, I actually think they worked in my favor&mdash;because Patroclus is overwhelmed by them himself.  He is this ordinary person who is pulled into a terrifying world of angry deities and destiny because of his love for Achilles.Maguire:Having glancingly heard of this legend before, I knew more or less how it would end. I had no idea how you might handle the loss of perspective and point of view when tragedy would inevitably strike. You managed to narrate an almost impossible transition from life into myth in part, I think, by your instinctual use of a combination of present and past tense, to say nothing of a masterly combining of authorial and first person observations. How many slaughtered bulls did you sacrifice, and on whose altar, to deserve the talent to risk such dangerous technique?Miller:It was a lot of bulls. And whatever ended up working, I give all the credit to my background in theater. When I first started writing, I had this idea that I should be in control of the story, forcing it forward. It never worked. What I needed to do was learn how to get in character, and write from there.It took me a long time to find just the right tone for the ending&mdash;I kept writing and throwing away, writing and throwing away. Then, in the middle of apartment-hunting, inspiration struck. All the other ideas had started out well, but would gum up before they got anywhere near the finish line. But this one kept humming right along. And it was the simplest, so there you go.Maguire:Oscar Wilde said something like, &ldquo;The Odyssey was written by Homer, or another Greek of the same name.&rdquo; But Oscar Wilde had clearly not met you. This is not a question. It is a salute.",

But whileAmsterdamwas a slim, sleek piece,Atonementis a more sturdy, more ambitious work, allowing McEwan more room to play, think, and experiment.We meet 13-year-old Briony Tallis in the summer of 1935, as she attempts to stage a production of her new drama \"The Trials of Arabella\" to welcome home her older, idolized brother Leon. But she soon discovers that her cousins, the glamorous Lola and the twin boys Jackson and Pierrot, aren't up to the task, and directorial ambitions are abandoned as more interesting prospects of preoccupation come onto the scene. The charlady's son, Robbie Turner, appears to be forcing Briony's sister Cecilia to strip in the fountain and sends her obscene letters; Leon has brought home a dim chocolate magnate keen for a war to promote his new \"Army Ammo\" chocolate bar; and upstairs, Briony's migraine-stricken mother Emily keeps tabs on the house from her bed. Soon, secrets emerge that change the lives of everyone present....The interwar, upper-middle-class setting of the book's long, masterfully sustained opening section might recall Virginia Woolf or Henry Green, but as we move forward--eventually to the turn of the 21st century--the novel's central concerns emerge, and McEwan's voice becomes clear, even personal. For at heart,Atonementis about the pleasures, pains, and dangers of writing, and perhaps even more, about the challenge of controlling what readers make of your writing.

Only his second collection (the first wasDark Carnival, later reworked intoThe October Country), it is a marvelous, if mostly dark, quilt of science fiction, fantasy, and horror. In an ingenious framework to open and close the book, Bradbury presents himself as a nameless narrator who meets the Illustrated Man--a wanderer whose entire body is a living canvas of exotic tattoos. What's even more remarkable, and increasingly disturbing, is that the illustrations are themselves magically alive, and each proceeds to unfold its own story, such as \"The Veldt,\" wherein rowdy children take a game of virtual reality way over the edge. Or \"Kaleidoscope,\" a heartbreaking portrait of stranded astronauts about to reenter our atmosphere--without the benefit of a spaceship. Or \"Zero Hour,\" in which invading aliens have discovered a most logical ally--our own children.

When his daughter Amy died suddenly at the age of 38 from an asymptomatic heart condition, journalist and novelist Rosen-blatt (Lapham Rising) and his wife moved into her house to help her husband care for their three young children. Not much happens except for the mundane, crucial duties of child care: reading stories, helping with schoolwork, chasing after an indefatigable toddler who is the busiest person I have ever known, making toast to order for finicky kids. Building on the small events of everyday life, Rosenblatt draws sharply etched portraits of his grandchildren; his stoic, gentle son-in-law; his wife, who feels slightly guilty that she is living her daughter's life; and Amy emerges as a smart, prickly, selfless figure whose significance the author never registered until her death. Rosenblatt avoids the sentimentality that might have weighed down the story; he writes with humor and an engagement with life that makes the occasional flashes of grief all the more telling. The result is a beautiful account of human loss, measured by the steady effort to fill in the void.(Feb. 16)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

That is to  say, covered with blood from the get-go.Without warning, the body jerked violently, pitching forward and slamming Sara  onto the floor. Blood spread out around both of them, and Sara instinctively  clawed to get out from under the convulsing woman. With her feet and hands she  groped for some kind of purchase on the slick bathroom floor. Finally, Sara  managed to slide out from underneath her. She turned Sibyl over, cradling her  head, trying to help her through the convulsions. Suddenly, the jerking stopped.Sibyl is, or was, Sibyl Adams, a college professor who had the misfortune of  being drugged, savagely raped, slashed, and left for dead in the toilet of the  local diner, to be coincidentally discovered by Sara Linton. Coincidences don't  stop there, and neither do the rapes and murders. The next is, unimaginably,  still more gruesome than the first and it, too, is discovered by Dr. Linton.  Police Chief Jeffrey Tolliver is Sara's ex-husband, and mercurial detective Lena  Adams, another major player in the ensuing drama, was Sibyl's twin sister.And the monster behind these increasingly more depraved acts? Suspects abound,  from the diner's jack-of-all-trades, Will Harris, to Victim No. 2's boyfriend,  to Jack Allen Wright who, a dozen years prior, raped Dr. Linton (that rape had  been a secret until now). There are other possibilities, naturally, and it soon  becomes apparent that Sara's an intended target.A graduate of the Patricia Cornwell school of mayhem and gore, Slaughter has  faithfully stitched together a fast, engaging, and diverting read complete with  a strong-yet-vulnerable heroine.

New to Atlanta, finance specialist Belinda Hennessey is glad to have her carpool mates to take her mind off her failed marriage. Before she can get too comfortable, however, she hits Officer Wade Alexander's police cruiser, misses a crucial meeting and clashes with her malevolent boss, Margo, who wants her to overlook the fact that the company they're merging with may have fudged its numbers. Belinda reluctantly agrees and then finds herself in hot water when Margo turns up dead. Though at times too gullible for her own good, Belinda comes into her own over the course of the novel. Her uncertainties about her job, her zany friends and her budding relationship with Wade are ably portrayed, as is the setting (Bond describes Atlanta's traffic as only a resident could). Clever snippets from the carpool quartet's work-in-progress, a relationship dos and don'ts book for women (\"DON'T underestimate the extent to which men underestimate women\"), leaven the story, as does the women's banter.

As part of the expansion pack, players will now be able to travel through the Dark Portal to confront the Legion on otherworldly battlefields.Although only one race has been revealed, Blizzard has announced plans to unveil details about possible additional races at a later date. On the other hand, many details have been released about the new continent, Outland. Players last visited Outland inWarcraft III: The Frozen Throne, alongside Illidan as he conquered the Pit Lord Magtheridon's domain. Players will also gain access to Quel'Thalas, the region to the northeast of the Forsaken lands, where the Blood Elves reside. Blizzard says that this expansion pack holds even more new areas that are ripe for player exploration -- additional details will be revealed in the months ahead.Blizzard also has plans to add new dungeons and battlegrounds with the expansion, though the exact number has not yet been determined. One upcoming dungeon that has players excited is Karazhan, which is located within Medivh's tower. Because Medivh has played such a central role in Warcraft lore, Blizzard is convinced that longtime players will be especially interested in seeing what Karazhan contains. As for battlegrounds, Blizzard has released very little information. However, they have announced plans to make some of the battles from the past accessible through the Caverns of Time.Blood Elves: The New RaceThousands of years ago, the exiled Highborne landed on the shores of Lordaeron and founded the enchanted kingdom of Quel'Thas. These high elves, as they called themselves, created a fountain of vast, magical energies within the heart of their land -- the Sunwell. Over time, they grew dependant on the Sunwell's unstable energies, regardless of the bitter lessons they'd learned in ages past.During the Third War, the villainous Prince Arthas invaded Quel'Thalas and reduced the once-mighty realm to rubble and ashes. His undead army decimated nearly all of the high elven population. In addition, he used the Sunwell's energies to resurrect a powerful undead Lich, Kel'thuzad, thereby fouling the Sunwell's mystical waters. The few elven survivors, realizing that they had been cut off from the source of their arcane power, grew increasingly volatile and desperate.In the midst of the elves' darkest hour came Kael'thas Sunstrider, the last of Quel'Thalas' royal bloodline. Kael, as he was commonly known, knew that the remnant of his people would not long survive without the nourishing magic that once empowered them. Renaming his people \"blood elves\" in honor of their fallen countrymen, Kael taught the survivors how to tap into ambient mystical energies -- even demonic energies -- in order to sate their terrible thirst for magic. In search of a new destiny for his people, Kael'thas ventured to the remote world of Outland where he encountered the fallen night elf, Illidan. Under Illidan's watchful eye, Kael and his blood elves regained much of their former power.Unfortunately, the blood elves practice of embracing demonic energies caused their former comrades in the Alliance to shun them. Thus, the remaining blood elves on Azeroth look desperately to the Horde to help them reach Outland where they can reunite with Kael'thas and achieve the golden destiny he has promised them.Outland: The New ContinentOnce the beautiful homeworld of the orcs, all that remains of Draenor is the scattered wastes of Outland. Following the Second War, the Alliance invaded Draenor by crossing through the Dark Portal. To their horror, they discovered that Ner'zhul -- the dark warlord of Horde -- had constructed a series of new gateways that could lead the beaten Horde to newer, unspoiled worlds. As the Alliance forces closed in around him, Ner'zhul opened his gateways as a means of escape. However, his plan backfired and the gateway's clashing energies resulted in a massive catastrophic explosion that ultimately ripped the world of Draenor to pieces.Nearly thirteen years later -- towards the end of the Third War -- the fallen night elf, Illidan, discovered that huge chunks of Draenor still existed, floating upon the astral winds of the Twisting Nether. After his defeat at the hands of the evil Prince Arthas, Illidan fled to the remnants of Draenor and dubbed them \"Outland.\" He quickly seized control of the chaotic region and sealed the last of Ner'zhul's gateways.Though he is the undisputed ruler of the ravaged land, Illidan lives in fear that he will be discovered by his powerful enemies -- most notably Arthas, the new Lich King, and the remaining Lords of the Burning Legion. For now, Outland is home to a number of scattered draenei tribes, primitive orcs, and powerful, arcane creatures of the Nether itself. Agents of the Burning Legion have also targeted the region as a vital strategic location in their unending Burning Crusade to scour all life from the universe.What else can expected? Blizzard has tantalized Warcraft players with the brief glimpse intoThe Burning Crusade'sstoryline. Will these heroes find friends or foes? What dangers and rewards lie in wait beyond the Dark Portal? And what will they do when they discover that the demons they thought were vanquished have returned to renew their terrible Burning Crusade? These and other questions will remain unanswered until the gameplay can be explored by role-playing Warcrafters.System RequirementsMinimumRecommendedOperating SystemPC: Microsoft Windows XP or Windows Vista (with latest Service Packs)Mac: Mac OS X 10.4.11 or newerCPUPC: Intel Pentium 4 1.3 GHz or AMD Athlong XP 1500+Mac: PowerPC G5 1.6 GHz or Intel Core Duo processorPC: Dual-core processor, such as Intel Pentium D or AmD Athlong 64 X2Mac: Intel 1.8 GHz processor or betterGraphics HardwarePC: 3D graphics processor with Hardware Transfor and Lighting with 32 MB VRAM, such as an ATI Radeon 7200 or NVIDIA GeForce2 class card or betterMac: 3D graphics processor with Hardware Transform and Lighting with 64 MB VRAM, such as ATI Radeon 9600 or NVIDIA GeForce Ti 4600 class card or betterPC: 3D Graphics processor with Vertex and Pixel Shader capabilities with 128 MB VRAM, such as an ATI Radeon X1600 or NVIDIA GeForce 7600 GT class card or betterMac: 3D graphics processor with Vertex and Pixel Shader capability with 128 MB VRAM, such as ATI Radeon X1600 or NVIDIA 7600 class card or better.MemoryPC: 512 MB (1 GB for Vista)Mac: 1 GBPC: 1 GB (2 GB for Vista)Mac: 2 GBHard Drive Space15 GB of free spaceAll Platform RequirementsKeyboard and mouse, required for controls.

        "0061779741": "Amazon Exclusive: Christopher Moore on WritingSacre BleuI suppose it started when I learned the circumstances of the suicide of Vincent van Gogh; how he had finished a painting, then walked into a corn field and shot himself, and not in the manner one thinks of a suicide. He shot himself in the abdomen, then walked over a mile on a rough trail through the woods above the village of Auvers, France, to the home of his friend, Doctor Gachet, for help. It seemed clear to me that this was not the behavior of a suicidal man. (Particularly when you see how well he was painting at the time.)  Vincent had been murdered, and for some reason, I guess from looking at his paintings, I thought that the color blue might be a clue to the circumstances of his murder.So I decided to write a novel about the color blue.When it first occurred to me, I had no idea what a can of paint of I was opening. I&rsquo;ve written historical novels before, but I&rsquo;d always picked periods and stories that had huge blank spots in them, spots that I could fill in with my story. But I was about to write about the period in which the French Impressionists rose to prominence, and unlike the life of Jesus or the court of King Lear, where very little was known about what actually happened,  I could pretty much look up what each of the Impressionists had for breakfast every morning.  It was a curse of riches. There was more material than I could ever cover in a single story, unless I found a way to constrain it.So, to pursue my murder mystery, my tale of an art movement,  my portrayal of the Bell Epoch in Paris, I had to find a point of view that would help me cover the time period, from 1863 to 1891 and beyond, so I invented, Lucien Lessard, the baker of Montmartre, Paris&mdash;the baker who wants to be a painter, whose father was a patron of Monet, Renoir, and Cezanne when they were at their poorest, and who attended art school with Vincent van Gogh and his best friend, Henri Toulouse-Lautrec. Lucien and Henri would be my detectives, and with them, we would discover not only Vincent&rsquo;s killer, but the secret and magic behind the mysterious shade of &ldquo;sacred blue&rdquo; (Sacr&eacute; Bleu), and how it had inspired and haunted artists all through history.Four years after the notion first occurred to me, I turned in the manuscript toSacr&eacute; Bleu, and I think it is what I had hoped it could be: a mystery, a fantasy, a romance, a comedy, a history, and an appreciation. I didn&rsquo;t have an art education going into this book, but I certainly do coming out, and I hope that the reader will painlessly and joyfully, share some of the enthusiasm I have for the subject.Or, as it says in the prelude:&ldquo;Blue is glory and power, a wave, a particle, a vibration, a resonance, a spirit, a passion, a memory, a vanity, a metaphor, a dream.Blue is a simile.Blue, she is like a woman.&rdquo;",

The tale begins with a poor slave boy named Shasta escaping from his adopted fisherman father who plans to sell him to a brutish stranger. A dignified talking war horse named Bree helps Shasta flee. Jennings plays Shasta with refreshing gentleness-listeners get a sense of the boy's sensitivity and fear as he embarks on the adventure of his life. The talented narrator plays Bree with the right amount of dignity and haughtiness. This horse amuses with his witty observations about human behavior, and sense of equine superiority. The horse and his boy hope to travel north to Narnia, and encounter numerous adventures and strange characters, all beautifully portrayed by Jennings. The most memorable supporting characters are another escaped child, a tough girl named Aravis, and her talking mare called Hwin. Jennings brings these two adventure seekers to life with his crystal clear narration. Thanks to his skills as a storyteller, the action moves rapidly from one exciting episode to the next. Evocative music plays at the beginning and end of each side of the tape. This presentation will enchant young listeners and encourage them to read the other titles in the series.

As the anniversary of the battle approaches, ancient politics and the present-day murder cause tensions between the trolls and dwarfs to boil. Though Koom Valley was a disaster for both sides, certain community leaders from each side have been spoiling for a rematch&mdash;something Vimes is duty-bound to prevent. In the midst of this, a push toward affirmative action forces Vimes to hire a vampire named Sally to the Watch. She's sworn off human blood, but that's cold comfort to the assortment of humans, dwarfs, trolls, werewolves and golems that make up the police force. Vimes and his motley crew of coppers are called upon to not only find the murderer and keep the peace but also, in a jab atThe Da Vinci Code, solve the riddle of a painting that reputedly holds the secret to what really happened at Koom Valley. Pratchett's fantastic imagination and satirical wit are on full display.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

As the narrator of this audio edition, Knox sounds authentic, sincere, and vulnerable. In early portions of the narrative related to the crime scene and arrest, her emotions are muted, conveying the same deer-in-the-headlights reaction for which she was skewered in media coverage at the time. Yet, while recounting her experiences in prison after being convicted, when she grasped the gravity of the situation, Knox conveys her sense of desperation during a process in which the cards seemed hopelessly stacked against her. Her conversations with a sympathetic prison chaplain and with her deeply loyal family and close friends are especially moving. In her recitation of legal details, Knox falls into occasional lapses in pronunciation, but given the weight of the personal aspects of her performance, these flaws prove minor and don't detract from the listening experience.

        "0060584009": "\"Just because I know how to change a guy's oil doesn't mean I want to spend the rest of my life on my back, staring up his undercarriage.\" From the word go, Evanovich delivers her usual goods, albeit in a different vehicle. After 10 Stephanie Plum novels, each more successful than the last, Evanovich introduces Alexandra Barnaby, aka Barney. Barney hails from Baltimore rather than New Jersey, but she's from the same slice of working-class life as Stephanie; she donned mechanic's overalls in her father's garage during summer breaks from college. Her younger brother, Wild Bill, shares her passion for cars, and now he's disappeared from Miami, along with NASCAR star Sam Hooker's boat, theHappy Hooker. Evanovich doesn't mind showing her romance roots, as Barney and Sam start off snarling at each other; as any reader can tell, they have to team up (a) to save Bill and (b) to enjoy delicious sex. As in the Plum books, plot takes a back seat to riffs, roughups and dialogue&mdash;and in the last lies the book's most notable distinction. If Stephanie bids fair to be New Jersey's Dorothy Parker, Barney is Baltimore's echo of Robert Parker. Conversation is terse and coded, full of sexual innuendo, with a high premium on toss-away lines uttered under duress. Despite the amazing quantity of physical jeopardy, there's little tension; it's all about hanging out with Metro Girl and NASCAR Guy&mdash;which may be just what millions of Evanovich fans will want.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Harvey undertakes the tast because \"Women are clueless about men,\" because \"Men get away with a whole lot of stuff\" and because he has \"some valuable information to change all of that.\" Harvey makes a game effort, taking a bold but familiar men-are-dogs approach: if you're \"cutting back\" on sex, \"he will have another woman lined up and waiting to give him what he needs and wants--the cookie.\" Several chapters later, however, he introduces the \"ninety-day rule,\" asserting that, actually, he won't always have another woman lined up--and the only way to makes sure is a three-month vetting period. Harvey also tackles mama's boys, \"independent--and lonely--women,\" and the matter of children in the dating world (\"If he's meeting the kids after you decide he's the one, it's too late\"). Feminists and the easily offended probably won't take to Harvey's blanket statements and blunt advice, but Harvey's fans and those in need of tough (but ticklish) love advice should check it out (especially the hysterical last-chapter Q&A;).Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0060887184": "Bestseller Cornwell leaps back a millennium from his Richard Sharpe series to tell of the consolidation of England in the late ninth century and the role played by a young (fictional) warrior-in-training who's at the center of the war between Christian Englishmen and the pagan Danes. (Most of the other principal characters&mdash;Ubba, Guthrum, Ivar the Boneless and the like&mdash;are real historical figures.) Young Uhtred, who's English, falls under the control of Viking &uuml;ber-warrior Ragnar the Fearless when the Dane wipes out Uhtred's Northumberland family. Cornwell liberally feeds readers history and nuggets of battle data and customs, with Uhtred's first-person wonderment spinning all into a colorful journey of (self-)discovery. In a series of episodes, Ragnar conquers three of England's four kingdoms. The juiciest segment has King Edmund of East Anglia rebuking the Viking pagans and demanding that they convert to Christianity if they intend to remain in England. After Edmund cites the example of St. Sebastian, the Danes oblige him by turning him into a latter-day Sebastian and sending him off to heaven. Uhtred's affection for Ragnar as a surrogate father grows, and he surpasses the conqueror's blood sons in valor. When father and adopted son arrive at the fourth and last kingdom, however, the Danes meet unexpected resistance and Uhtred faces personal and familial challenges, as well as a crisis of national allegiance.

The light, the views, the colors, the heat&mdash;I find them all intoxicating. I went for the first time with the college boyfriend who would become my husband; his family had had a house in the Luberon for some twenty years. We finally bought our own property in France five years ago after my husband decided to give up banking and realize his long-held ambition to compose music.&ldquo;Les Gen&eacute;vriers&rdquo; (not the property&rsquo;s real name) is described inThe Lanternmore or less as we found it. Its setting is as accurate as I can make it without giving away its precise location. The Luberon area is one of the most sought-after locations in Provence, known for its hilltop villages, lavender, abundant fruit and clear bright light. It is the area Peter Mayle famously chronicled inA Year in Provence.In addition to the abandoned farming hamlet, the story has its roots in the lavender fields and perfume industry in the region. There are small lavender fields and tiny family-run lavender distilleries all around where we live, but the main centers are to the north in Sault and, as described in the novel, to the east at Manosque and the Valensole plateau.The idea of a blind perfumer came from the realization that there were strips of Braille on the packaging used by beauty product brand L&rsquo;Occitane en Provence, based at Manosque. In 1997 the company created the foundation Provence dans tous les Sens (All the Senses of Provence) to introduce visually-impaired children to the world of perfume creation. In the novel, Marthe Lincel finds her true talent as a perfume &ldquo;nose&rdquo; after a visit to the Distillerie Musset from the school for the blind she attends in Manosque, although this episode takes place in the 1930s.For most of the 20th century in this region, there was a gradual erosion of traditional farming as young people moved to the towns to seek work in the new industries and factories. The struggle was intense for those left behind on the hill farms in a region that was poor until the advent of mass tourism. InThe Lantern, as Pierre--the only brother--takes off for better-paid work, and Marthe finds increasing success in Paris, this is the struggle faced by B&eacute;n&eacute;dicte at &ldquo;Les Gen&eacute;vriers&rdquo;&mdash;and the past which gradually comes to disquiet Eve, the heroine of the contemporary narrative strand of the novel.Like Eve, I am an avid reader and worryingly prone to over-imagination. While at the house our first summer, camping on stone floors, I re-read Daphne du Maurier&rsquo;sRebecca, and was as captivated by it as ever--but my thoughts wandered... what if I had come to this place knowing less about the area, or perhaps, less about the man I was with?--Deborah LawrensonA Look InsideThe LanternClick on the images below to open larger versions.Lavender field in sunlightGarden door to the walnut wine cellarView from Gordes to the Luberon ridgeA room with a viewSide door into the alleyway",

All do, however, have motives for murder: the smarmy fellow has personally humiliated successful Felicia Redmon, professionally backstabbed not-so-successful Tallie Blankenship and plagiarized the plot of a book that means the world to ambitious Jan Glass. So confessing that they were the last to see their tormentor alive is likely to make them prime suspects, even in the eyes of Tallie's protective new cop boyfriend. But if they stay silent, they may wind up being the real murderer's next victims. While whodunit isn't revealed till the book's surprise ending, the suspense isn't the kind that kills you. As is typical of Bond's books (Party Crashers,etc.), the overall tone is deliciously frothy, and small comedic details abound: high-powered Felicia is a secret super housewife who cleans, cooks and lies about it, and Jan has changed her name from plain \"Jane\" to appear more glamorously French.

As the story opens, Tatiana, the youngest member of the Metanova family, is just 17; she still shares a bed with her older sister, Dasha. Not long after the country goes to war with Germany, Tatiana meets Alexander, a soldier, and sparks fly. It turns out, however, that Alexander is the same soldier Dasha has been crowing about. Possessed of a strong sense of family loyalty, and living under conditions that permit no privacy, Tatiana refuses to interfere with her sister's happiness, but the attraction between Tatiana and Alexander proves too powerful. Complicating matters, another soldier, Dimitri, has information that could destroy Alexander, and Dimitri likes Tatiana, too. In order to protect both Dasha's feelings and Alexander's life, the star-crossed lovers become part of a deceptive quadrangle as war intensifies around them. Taking her title from a tragic poem by Alexandr Pushkin, Simons skillfully highlights the ironies of the socialist utopia. Despite the novel's sprawling length and its seemingly epic scope, the nearly single-minded focus on dialogue between Tatiana and Alexander leaves other character development shortchanged and the reader with the impression of a peculiarly tiny canvas. Nave and occupying the Cinderella role in her family, Tatiana is certainly a survivor though one who finally outstays her welcome. While her love story is often both tender and fierce, it is also overwrought and prolonged past the breaking point.

But looks aren't everything; his quality, an admirer once wrote,  \"was mostly in his heart.\" Laura Hillenbrand tells the story of the horse who  became a cultural icon inSeabiscuit: An American Legend.Seabiscuit rose to prominence with the help of an unlikely triumvirate: owner  Charles Howard, an automobile baron who once declared that \"the day of the horse  is past\"; trainer Tom Smith, a man who \"had cultivated an almost mystical  communication with horses\"; and jockey Red Pollard, who was down on his luck  when he charmed a then-surly horse with his calm demeanor and a sugar cube.  Hillenbrand details the ups and downs of \"team Seabiscuit,\" from early training  sessions to record-breaking victories, and from serious injury to \"Horse of the  Year\"--as well as the Biscuit's fabled rivalry with War Admiral. She also  describes the world of horseracing in the 1930s, from the snobbery of Eastern  journalists regarding Western horses and public fascination with the great  thoroughbreds to the jockeys' torturous weight-loss regimens, including saunas  in rubber suits, strong purgatives, even tapeworms.Along the way, Hillenbrand paints wonderful images: tears in Tom Smith's eyes as  his hero, legendary trainer James Fitzsimmons, asked to hold Seabiscuit's bridle  while the horse was saddled; critically injured Red Pollard, whose  chest was crushed in a racing accident a few weeks before, listening to the San  Antonio Handicap from his hospital bed, cheering \"Get going, Biscuit! Get 'em,  you old devil!\"; Seabiscuit happily posing for photographers for several minutes  on end; other horses refusing to work out with Seabiscuit because he teased and  taunted them with his blistering speed.Though sometimes her prose takes on a distinctly purple hue (\"His history had  the ethereal quality of hoofprints in windblown snow\"; \"The California sunlight  had the pewter cast of a declining season\"), Hillenbrand has crafted a  delightful book.

Isabel Favor is a tightly wound self-help guru and author of The Four Cornerstones of a Favorable Life whose own perfect life has recently come crashing down around her. Both have come to Italy to escape the endless rehashes of their latest misfortunes in the public eye, and the equally endless drone of self-criticism.

Imagine their surprise when Isabel turns up on Ren's doorstep, her much anticipated rental villa belonging to none other than her ill-advised one-night stand. As might be anticipated, their fiery antagonism soon breeds sparks of a different kind. The relationship develops in a somewhat familiar fashion, but the development of Isabel and Ren as characters makes their story shine. Meanwhile, at the villa, all is not as it seems, and the two lovers find themselves playing amateur detectives, trying to untangle the strange behavior of the townspeople and of Ren's hired caretaker. As if things weren't complicated enough, Ren's ex-wife, Tracy, suddenly appears on the scene pregnant and with several kids in tow.

Where Alice Humphreys came off as strong and directed in the earlier novel, New Yorker McKenna Wright seems insecure, much less comfortable in her skin. Plotting, too, is a little less focused than usual for Burke, whose Detective Ellie Hatcher series has earned accolades for character development and tightly controlled plotting. Even so, Burke manages to deliver some exciting moments here, as lawyer-turned-journalist McKenna finds her life turned upside down when she recognizes a friend from her college years who disappeared without a trace a decade before on a video of a near-tragedy on the subway. At the same time, McKenna&#x2019;s career takes a devastating hit when evidence turns up that compromising e-mails she used in an article about a judge originated not from the public but from her own computer. Stubborn curiosity about her friend and anger about unjust accusations propel McKenna forward into what others assert is ridiculously wild speculation.

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers.

Every secular Christmas tradition is included.  But as thisisthe 21st Discworld novel, there are some unusual twists.This year the Auditors, who want people to stop believing in things that aren't real, have hired an assassin to eliminate the Hogfather. (You know him: red robe, white beard, says, \"Ho, ho, ho!\") Their evil plot will destroy the Discworld unless someone covers for him.  So someone does. Well, at least Deathtries.  He wears the costume and rides the sleigh drawn by four jolly pigs: Gouger, Tusker, Rooter, and Snouter.  He even comes down chimneys.  But as fans of other Pratchett stories about Death (Mort,Reaper Man, andSoul Music) know, he takes things literally. He gives children whatever they wish for and appears in person at Crumley's in The Maul.Fans will welcome back Susan, Death of Rats (the Grim Squeaker), Albert, and the wizardly faculty of Unseen University, and revel in new personalities like Bilious, the \"oh god of Hangovers.\"  But you needn't have read Pratchett before to laugh uproariously and think seriously about the meanings of Christmas.--Nona Vero--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

        "0099416158": "Ever since he publishedThe Firmin 1991, John Grisham has remained the undisputed champ of the legal thriller. WithA Painted House, however, he strikes out in a new direction. As the author is quick to note, this novel includes \"not a single lawyer, dead or alive,\" and readers will search in vain for the kind of lowlife machinations that have been his stock-in-trade. Instead, Grisham has delivered a quieter, more contemplative story, set in rural Arkansas in 1952. It's harvest time on the Chandler farm, and the family has hired a crew of migrant Mexicans and \"hill people\" to pick 80 acres of cotton. A certain camaraderie pervades this bucolic dream team. But it's backbreaking work, particularly for the 7-year-old narrator, Luke: \"I would pick cotton, tearing the fluffy bolls from the stalks at a steady pace, stuffing them into the heavy sack, afraid to look down the row and be reminded of how endless it was, afraid to slow down because someone would notice.\"What's more, tensions begin to simmer between the Mexicans and the hill people, one of whom has a penchant for bare-knuckles brawling. This leads to a brutal murder, which young Luke has the bad luck to witness. At this point--with secrets, lies, and at least one knife fight in the offing--the plot begins to take on that familiar, Grisham-style momentum. Still, such matters ultimately take a back seat inA Painted Houseto the author's evocation of time and place. This is, after all, the scene of his boyhood, and Grisham waxes nostalgic without ever succumbing to deep-fried sentimentality. Meanwhile, his account of Luke's Baptist upbringing occasions some sly (and telling) humor:I'd been taught in Sunday school from the day I could walk that lying would send you straight to hell. No detours. No second chances. Straight into the fiery pit, where Satan was waiting with the likes of Hitler and Judas Iscariot and General Grant. Thou shalt not bear false witness, which, of course, didn't sound exactly like a strict prohibition against lying, but that was the way the Baptists interpreted it.Whether Grisham will continue along these lines, or revert to the judicial shark tank for his next book, is anybody's guess. ButA Painted Housesuggests that he's perfectly capable of telling an involving story with nary a subpoena in sight.--James Marcus--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

John Irving's novel, which inspired the 1998 Jim Carrey movieSimon Birch, is his most popular book in Britain, and perhaps the oddest Christian mystic novel sinceFlannery O'Connor's work. Irving fans will find much that is familiar: the New England prep-school-town setting, symbolic amputations of man and beast, theGarp-like unknown father of the narrator (Owen's orphaned best friend), the rough comedy. The scene of doltish the doltish headmaster driving a trashed VW down the school's marble staircase is a marvelous set piece. So are the Christmas pageants Owen stars in. But it's all, asHighlightsmagazine used to put it, \"fun with a purpose.\"  When Owen plays baby Jesus in the pageants, and glimpses a tombstone with his death date while enactingA Christmas Carol, the slapstick doesn't cancel the fact that hewasborn to be martyred. The book's countless subplots add up to a moral argument, specifically an indictment of American foreign policy--from Vietnam to the Contras.The book's mystic religiosity is steeped in Robertson Davies'sDeptford trilogy, and the fatal baseball relates to the fatefully misdirected snowball in the first Deptford novel,Fifth Business. Tiny, symbolic Owen echoes the hero of Irving's teacher G&uuml;nter Grass'sThe Tin Drum--the two characters share the same initials.

His rich, dark, scandal-ridden story of  squandered fortune, incest (in thought if not in deed), madness, congenital brain damage, theft, illegitimacy, and stoic endurance is told in the interior  voices of three Compson brothers: first Benjy, the \"idiot\" man-child who  blurs together three decades of inchoate sensations as he stalks the fringes  of the family's former pasture; next Quentin, torturing himself brilliantly, obsessively over Caddy's lost virginity and his own failure to recover the family's honor as he wanders around the seedy fringes of Boston; and finally Jason, heartless, shrewd, sneaking, nursing a perpetual sense of injury and outrage against his outrageous family.If Benjy's section is the most daringly experimental, Jason's is the most  harrowing. \"Once a bitch always a bitch, what I say,\" he begins, lacing into Caddy's illegitimate daughter, and then proceeds to hurl mud at blacks, Jews, his sacred Compson ancestors, his glamorous, promiscuous sister, his  doomed  brother Quentin, his ailing mother, and the long-suffering black servant Dilsey who holds the family together by sheer force of character.Notoriously \"difficult,\"The Sound and the Furyis actually one of  Faulkner's more accessible works once you get past the abrupt, unannounced  time shifts--and certainly the most powerful emotionally. Everything is  here: the complex equilibrium of pre-civil rights race relations; the  conflict between Yankee capitalism and Southern agrarian values; a meditation  on time, consciousness, and Western philosophy. And all of it is rendered in prose  so gorgeous it can take your breath away. Here, for instance, Quentin recalls an  autumnal encounter back home with the old black possum hunter Uncle Louis:And we'd sit in the dry leaves that whispered a little with the slow  respiration of our waiting and with the slow breathing of the earth and the windless October, the rank smell of the lantern fouling the brittle air,  listening to the dogs and to the echo of Louis' voice dying away.  He never raised it, yet on a still night we have heard it from our front porch.  When  he called the dogs in he sounded just like the horn he carried slung on his shoulder and never used, but clearer, mellower, as though his voice were a  part of darkness and silence, coiling out of it, coiling into it again.   WhoOoooo.  WhoOoooo.  WhoOooooooooooooooo.What Faulkner has created is a modernist epic in which characters assume  the stature of gods and the primal family events resonate like myths. It isThe Sound and the Furythat secures his place in what Edmund Wilson called \"the full-dressed post-Flaubert group of Conrad, Joyce, and Proust.\"--David Laskin--This text refers to an alternatePaperbackedition.",

Attitude, Jeffrey Gitomer&#39;sThe Little Green Book of Getting Your Waydigs deep into the 9.5 elements that make persuasion, and getting your way, happen. By breaking down the elements, the reader will begin to understand, take action, become proficient, and then master the ability to persuade. Because persuasion occurs in so many different areas of life and business, Gitomer leads the reader from mental readiness to the principles of getting your way and the power that persuasion offers. He challenges the reader to prepare before they present, to prepare before they try to persuade. He demonstrates how to change a presentation into a performance and shows how this can be done in any environment. But because persuasion most often takes place in business, he draws special emphasis to the reader&#39;s ability to write and sell persuasively. The book talks about the persistence that enables winning persuasion. He brings the Benjamin Franklin quote \"If at first you don&#39;t succeed, try, try again\" to the Gitomer level of \"You only fail when you decide to quit,\" and the book ends challenging the reader how to think about excellence and eloquence.

        "0060652942": "C.S. Lewis'sThe Abolition of Manpurports to be a book specifically about public education, but its central concerns are broadly political, religious, and philosophical. In the best of the book's three essays, \"Men Without Chests,\" Lewis trains his laser-sharp wit on a mid- century English high school text, considering the ramifications of teaching British students to believe in idle relativism, and to reject \"the doctrine of objective value, the belief that certain attitudes are really true, and others really false, to the kind of thing the universe is and the kinds of things we are.\" Lewis calls this doctrine the \"Tao,\" and he spends much of the book explaining why society needs a sense of objective values.The Abolition of Manspeaks with astonishing freshness to contemporary debates about morality; and even if Lewis seems a bit too cranky and privileged for his arguments to be swallowed whole, at least his articulation of values seems less ego-driven, and therefore is more useful, than that of current writers such as Bill Bennett and James Dobson.--Michael Joseph Gross--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

This goth-girl is obsessed with vampires and when a new family moves into the old town mansion, she is convinced that the son, Alexander, is a vampire. The story swirls around and through sibling rivalry, peer relationships, friendships, and love. Raven is a feisty protagonist with a quick wit and a real sense of self. She defends herself and her friends, often besting her peers with humor and a quick tongue. As her connection with Alexander deepens, she comes to understand her family better. It is through his shadowy character that readers are kept off balance. Schreiber weaves a tale that is more about acceptance and friendship than about vampire behavior and culture, and sustains a tone that draws readers to the characters rather than to horrific plot developments that would keep them reading. There is far less intensity than in Annette Curtis Klause's Silver Kiss (Laurel-Leaf, 1992) and less moodiness than that found in Amelia Atwater-Rhodes's Midnight Predator (2002) and Shattered Mirror (2001, both Delacorte). While the ending isn't tied up in a neat and pretty bow, it fits the style and tone. All in all, a good read for those who want a vampire love story without the gore.Molly S.

The whole world must decide between American values and its two oppositional alternatives: Islamism and European-style democratic socialism.Prager&#8212;a bestselling author, columnist, and nationally syndicated radio talk show host who is read and heard by millions of people in America and abroad&#8212;makes the case for the American value system as the most viable program ever devised to produce a good society. Those values are explained here more clearly and persuasively than ever before.Still the Best Hopedeals with three huge themes: The first is perhaps the most persuasive explanation for why Leftism has been and will always be a moral failure, despite its acknowledged appeal to many people of goodwill. The second explains why fundamentalist Islam, despite its historic and growing appeal, cannot make a good society. But Prager holds out hope for an open and tolerant Islam and explains why it will emerge from faithful American Muslims. The third is a singularly persuasive defense and explanation of what Prager calls the \"American Trinity\": liberty, values rooted in the Creator, and the melting-pot ideal. These values are inscribed on every American coin as \"Liberty,\" \"In God We Trust,\" and \"E Pluribus Unum,\" and they are the reasons for America's greatness. Without them, America will cease to be an exceptional nation, and therefore cease to be America.Prager shows why these values can and must be adopted by every nation and culture in the world, why Americans must relearn and recommit to these values, and why America must vigorously export them. For if the world does not adopt American values, the result will be chaos and barbarism on an unprecedented scale.",

When vengeful drug dealers and federal agents go after an innocent college student, Andy McKenna, who's come to enjoy Florida's Panama City Beach, Serge becomes Andy's protector. Along the way, Serge delivers rough justice in inventive and bizarre fashion (death by garage door, by bridge guitar, etc.) to a mugger, a rude driver, and various others guilty of minor infractions.

She begins her trip a prim schoolgirl returning home to her American family from England. From the start, there is something wrong with the Seahawk : the families that were to serve as Charlotte's chaperones do not arrive, and the unsavory crew warns her not to make the trip. When the crew rebels, Charlotte first sides with the civilized Captain Jaggerty, but before long she realizes that he is a sadist and--the only female aboard--she joins the crew as a seaman. Charlotte is charged with murder and sentenced to be hanged before the trip is over, but ends up in command of the Seahawk by the time it reaches its destination. Charlotte's repressive Puritanical family refuses to believe her tale, and the girl returns to the sea. Charlotte's story is a gem of nautical adventure, and Avi's control of tone calls to mind William Golding's 1980s trilogy of historical novels of the sea.

        "0060175869": "In the last half-millennium, as the noted cultural critic and historianJacques Barzunobserves, great revolutions have swept the Western world. Each has brought profound change--for instance, the remaking of the commercial and social worlds wrought by the rise of Protestantism and by the decline of hereditary monarchies. And each, Barzun hints, is too little studied or appreciated today, in a time he does not hesitate to label as decadent.To leaf through Barzun's sweeping, densely detailed but lightly written survey of the last 500 years is to ride a whirlwind of world-changing events. Barzun ponders, for instance, the tumultuous political climate of Renaissance Italy, which yielded mayhem and chaos, but also the work of Michelangelo and Leonardo--and, he adds, the scientific foundations for today's consumer culture of boom boxes and rollerblades. He considers the 16th-century varieties of religious experimentation that arose in the wake of Martin Luther's 95 theses, some of which led to the repression of individual personality, others of which might easily have come from the \"Me Decade.\" Along the way, he offers a miniature history of the detective novel, defends Surrealism from its detractors, and derides the rise of professional sports, packing in a wealth of learned and often barbed asides.Never shy of controversy, Barzun writes from a generally conservative position; he insists on the importance of moral values, celebrates the historical contributions of Christopher Columbus, and twits the academic practitioners of political correctness. Whether accepting of those views or not, even the most casual reader will find much that is new or little-explored in this attractive venture into cultural history.--Gregory McNamee",

She took acting classes, modeled clothes, sold industry papers in the theater district, ushered at shows, danced at the USO&mdash;anything to get a break. Barely 18 when director Howard Hawks brought her to Hollywood for a screen test, she soon fell in love with Bogart, married and started a family. After Bogart's death a decade later, she rebounded with Sinatra, but tied the knot with Jason Robards before finding her way as a single woman, with friends and work as her passion. Bacall's intimates&mdash;from Katharine Hepburn to Adlai Stevenson&mdash;weren't the standard air-kissing, gossip-column regulars, but people who loved and respected each other for their work and their values. Sadly, like Bogart, they're also of a generation older than Bacall, so there's a lot of dying in these pages. Indeed, this sequel to 1978'sBy Myselfis mostly a discussion of the deaths of some great friends: Roddy McDowall, John Gielgud, Gregory Peck and many more. Bacall does discuss the roles she's played as an older actress, but this work's real theme is the experience of surviving the death of so many wonderful friends. Readers looking for basic Hollywood romance and drama can stick to the first 400 pages; those seeking a more mature portrait can brave the final 100. Either way, Bacall's a class act.

Born to an Indian academic and his wife, Gogol is afflicted from birth with a name that is neither Indian nor American nor even really a first name at all. He is given the name by his father who, before he came to America to study at MIT, was almost killed in a train wreck in India. Rescuers caught sight of the volume of Nikolai Gogol's short stories that he held, and hauled him from the train. Ashoke gives his American-born son the name as a kind of placeholder, and the awkward thing sticks.Awkwardness is Gogol's birthright. He grows up a bright American boy, goes to Yale, has pretty girlfriends, becomes a successful architect, but like many second-generation immigrants, he can never quite find his place in the world. There's a lovely section where he dates a wealthy, cultured young Manhattan woman who lives with her charming parents. They fold Gogol into their easy, elegant life, but even here he can find no peace and he breaks off the relationship.  His mother finally sets him up on a blind date with the daughter of a Bengali friend, and Gogol thinks he has found his match. Moushumi, like Gogol, is at odds with the Indian-American world she inhabits. She has found, however, a circuitous escape: \"At Brown, her rebellion had been academic ... she'd pursued a double major in French. Immersing herself in a third language, a third culture, had been her refuge--she approached French, unlike things American or Indian, without guilt, or misgiving, or expectation of any kind.\" Lahiri documents these quiet rebellions and random longings with great sensitivity. There's no  cleverness or showing-off inThe Namesake, just beautifully confident storytelling. Gogol's story is neither comedy nor tragedy; it's simply that ordinary, hard-to-get-down-on-paper commodity: real life.--Claire Dederer--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

The Legend of Zelda&trade;: Skyward Sword shakes up the tried-and-true adventure game formula and marks a turning point for the franchise. The introduction of full motion controls to the series enabled by Wii MotionPlus&trade; technology enhances player movements while offering the most intuitive play control of any game in the series to date.&nbsp;FEATURES:The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword boasts the most realistic sword combat of any game to date, turning every encounter into a challenge of both brains and brawn. Wii MotionPlus technology accurately translates the angle of every sword slice, effectively putting Link's blade in the player's hand. Analyzing enemy attack and defense tendencies and counteracting with precise swings of the sword provide a satisfying experience that blends puzzle-solving with a new and distinctly unique combat system.&nbsp;Explore a massive, multilayered world that seamlessly blends soaring exploration in a sea of clouds with intense ground-based adventuring that blurs the line between the main world and traditional Zelda dungeons. Link&trade; soars through the skies on the back of a noble bird and dives beneath the clouds to the continent below in an epic quest that lays the foundation for the events in the critically acclaimed The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.&nbsp;Prepare for intense puzzle-solving as only The Legend of Zelda games can deliver. Exploration of the forests, volcanoes and deserts requires players to think on their feet as they solve puzzles, overcome obstacles and escape deadly traps. Once they find their way to each dungeon, they are confronted by even more puzzles guarded by fiendish enemies.&nbsp;The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword redefines the traditional Zelda framework and introduces an arsenal of items, upgrades and rewards unlike any game in the franchise to date. The adventure guides players into, out of and back to dungeons and areas they've already completed. Along the way, Link gathers a massive inventory of peculiar items and resources that can be used to upgrade many of his weapons and equipment.Every copy in the initial production of the game will come packaged with a special music CD featuring orchestral arrangements of select songs performed at The Legend of Zelda 25th Anniversary Symphony Concert.&nbsp;A Wii Remote Plus&trade; controller or Wii MotionPlus&trade; accessory is required to play The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword. There will also be a limited edition bundle version of the game available, with a Gold Wii Remote Plus&trade; controller included.&nbsp;",
        "0060558121": "American Godsis Neil Gaiman's best and most ambitious novel yet, a scary, strange, and hallucinogenic road-trip story wrapped around a deep examination of the American spirit. Gaiman tackles everything from the onslaught of the information age to the meaning of death, but he doesn't sacrifice the razor-sharp plotting and narrative style he's been delivering since hisSandmandays.Shadow gets out of prison early when his wife is killed in a car crash. At a loss, he takes up with a mysterious character called Wednesday, who is much more than he appears. In fact, Wednesday is an old god, once known as Odin the All-father, who is roaming America rounding up his forgotten fellows in preparation for an epic battle against the upstart deities of the Internet, credit cards, television, and all that is wired. Shadow agrees to help Wednesday, and they whirl through a psycho-spiritual storm that becomes all too real in its manifestations. For instance, Shadow's dead wife Laura keeps showing up, and not just as a ghost--the difficulty of their continuing relationship is by turns grim and darkly funny, just like the rest of the book.Armed only with some coin tricks and a sense of purpose, Shadow travels through, around, and underneath the visible surface of things, digging up all the powerful myths Americans brought with them in their journeys to this land as well as the ones that were already here. Shadow's road story is the heart of the novel, and it's here that Gaiman offers up the details that make this such a cinematic book--the distinctly American foods and diversions, the bizarre roadside attractions, the decrepit gods reduced to shell games and prostitution. \"This is a bad land for Gods,\" says Shadow.More than a tourist in America, but not a native, Neil Gaiman offers an outside-in and inside-out perspective on the soul and spirituality of the country--our obsessions with money and power, our jumbled religious heritage and its societal outcomes, and the millennial decisions we face about what's real and what's not.--Therese Littleton--This text refers to theHardcoveredition.",

        "0060764945": "The BBC Radio production ofThe Voyage of the Dawn Treaderis a delightful two-hour sail on the most fabulous ship in Narnia. Lucy and Edmund, with their dreadful cousin Eustace, get magically pulled into a painting of a ship at sea. That ship is theDawn Treader, and on board is Caspian, King of Narnia. He and his companions, including Reepicheep, the valiant warrior mouse, are searching for seven lost lords of Narnia, and their voyage will take them to the edge of the world. Their adventures include being captured by slave traders, a much-too-close encounter with a dragon, and visits to many enchanted islands, including the place where dreams come true. The adaptation is faithful to its source, C.S. Lewis's series of Narnia books, which have provided exciting and uplifting tales for generations of children. BBC Radio does wonders with sound effects--the ship creaks in the wind, the sorrowful dragon roars lugubriously--and musical cues and interludes that keep the pacing dynamic. There's also a splendid cast of plummy British voices, making this far more than a book read onto cassette--it's an audio drama, as enjoyable as a trip to the theater. Grownups who buy this tape for their children will want to borrow it for themselves.

        "0060554738": "Are you just another AFC (\"average frustrated chump\") trying to meet an HB (\"hot babe\")? How would you like to \"full-close\" with a Penthouse Pet of the Year? The answers, my friend, are in Neil Strauss's entertaining bookThe Game. Strauss was a self-described chick repellant--complete with large, bumpy nose, small, beady eyes, glasses, balding head, and, worst of all, painful shyness around women. He felt like \"half a man.\" That is, until a book editor asked him to investigate the community of pickup artists. Strauss's life was transformed. He spent two years bedding some fine chiquitas and studying with some of the North America's most suave gents--including the best of them all, the God of the pickup \"community,\" a man named Mystery.Mystery is an aspiring Toronto magician who charges $2,250 for a weekend pickup workshop. He is not much to look at: a cross between a vampire and a computer geek. But by using high-powered marketing techniques he's turned seduction into an effortless craft--even inventing his own vocabulary. His technique sounds like a car salesman's tip sheet: his main rule is FMAC--find, meet, attract, close. He employs the \"three-second rule\"--always approach a woman within three seconds of first seeing her in order to avoid getting shy. Other tricks: Intrigue a beautiful woman by pretending to be unaffected by her charm; also, never hit on a woman right away. Start with a disarming, innocent remark, like \"Do you think magic spells work?\" or \"Oh my god, did you see those two girls fighting outside?\" And finally, the most important characteristic of the pickup artist--smile.After two years, Strauss ends up becoming almost as successful as Mystery, but he comes to an important realization. His techniques were actually off-putting to the woman he ended up falling in love with. And they never prepared him for actually having a relationship. After a while, he ran out of one-liners and had to have a real conversation. Still,The Gameis a great read that may help some AFCs come out of their shells.--Alex Roslin",
        "0061991066": "In this sequel to The Blood Gospel (2013), archaeologist Erin Granger receives a message from Cardinal Bernard, leader of the Order of Sanguines, a group of vampires operating within the Vatican, whose thirst for human blood is kept in check by the blood of Christ. The message leads Erin back into the ancient war between the Sanguines and the Strigoi, a rival group of vampires whose interests lie in a more evil direction than the Sanguines&#x2019;. Now a new villain has surfaced, a man who calls himself Judas Iscariot&#x2014;and who may indeed be the biblical Judas. To save the world from Armageddon, Erin reluctantly joins forces with another entity whose evil nature is not to be trifled with. This collaboration between Rollins, the well-known author of the Sigma Force thrillers (contemporary stories with ties to ancient riddles), and Cantrell, author of the atmospheric Hannah Vogel mysteries (set in Berlin in the 1930s), should appeal to their fans, but also to readers who like an action-packed, epic-size story portraying the battle between Good and Evil. --David Pitt",

Their father, Gene, was a drug addict attracted to young girls. Their mother, Izzy, was a boozer who paid little attention to the care and safety of her daughters. Gene died of dubious causes, and Izzy killed herself in grief. The girls are better off without their parents, and they know it. The challenge is to stay out of the way of the authorities for a year until Marnie turns 16 and will be legally able to take guardianship of her sister.

        "0007149824": "[Signature]Reviewed byJess WalterThey are the \"frozen Chosen,\" two million people living, dying and kvetching in Sitka, Alaska, the temporary homeland established for displaced World War II Jews in Chabon's ambitious and entertaining new novel. It is&mdash;deep breath now&mdash;a murder-mystery speculative-history Jewish-identity noir chess thriller, so perhaps it's no surprise that, in the back half of the book, the moving parts become unwieldy; Chabon is juggling narrative chainsaws here.The novel begins&mdash;the same way that Philip Roth launchedThe Plot Against America&mdash;with a fascinating historical footnote: what if, as Franklin Roosevelt proposed on the eve of World War II, a temporary Jewish settlement had been established on the Alaska panhandle? Roosevelt's plan went nowhere, but Chabon runs the idea into the present, back-loading his tale with a haunting history. Israel failed to get a foothold in the Middle East, and since the Sitka solution was only temporary, Alaskan Jews are about to lose their cold homeland. The book's timeless refrain: \"It's a strange time to be a Jew.\"Into this world arrives Chabon's Chandler-ready hero, Meyer Landsman, a drunken rogue cop who wakes in a flophouse to find that one of his neighbors has been murdered. With his half-Tlingit, half-Jewish partner and his sexy-tough boss, who happens also to be his ex-wife, Landsman investigates a fascinating underworld of Orthodox black-hat gangs and crime-lord rabbis. Chabon's \"Alyeska\" is an act of fearless imagination, more evidence of the soaring talent of his previous genre-blender, the Pulitzer Prize&ndash;winningThe Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay.Eventually, however, Chabon's homage to noir feels heavy-handed, with too many scenes of snappy tough-guy banter and too much of the kind of elaborate thriller plotting that requires long explanations and offscreen conspiracies.Chabon can certainly write noir&mdash;or whatever else he wants; his recent Sherlock Holmes novel,The Final Solution, was lovely, even if theNew York Times Book Reviewsniffed its surprise that the mystery novel would \"appeal to the real writer.\" Should any other snobs mistake Chabon for anything less than a real writer, this book offers new evidence of his peerless storytelling and style. Characters have skin \"as pale as a page of commentary\" and rough voices \"like an onion rolling in a bucket.\" It's a solid performance that would have been even better with a little more Yiddish and a little less police.(May)Jess Walter was a finalist for the 2006 National Book Award forThe Zeroand the winner of the 2006 Edgar Award for best novel forCitizen Vince.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Itched to be a fly on your agent's office wall as she ignored your calls? Here's voyeurism at its playful, charming finest in Keyes's latest (afterSushi for Beginners;Under the Duvet; etc.). Gemma Hogan is living a lovely carefree life in Dublin when her father walks out on her mother, and she is summoned to play mom to her mom. But the magic of e-mail allows her to vent her woes to a friend in Seattle, who finds them hilarious enough to send to a top London agent, JoJo Harvey. JoJo, who is half Jessica Rabbit and half corporate powerhouse, likes Gemma's work but has bigger fish to fry-she is having a tormented affair with her married boss; her slimy co-worker is trying to beat her out for a coveted partner position; and her famed client Lily Wright, who wrote a gorgeous little cheerful fable that sold hundreds of thousands of copies, can't seem to get it together to write another book. Lily, in turn, is struggling with young motherhood, catastrophic finances and the paralyzing guilt of stealing her now-husband Anton from her former best friend, one Gemma Hogan. Keyes skillfully ties her interlocking plots together with grace and humor, and explores three disparate but gloriously real women's lives.

If you have been introduced to the three Baudelaire orphans in any of Lemony Snicket's previous novels, you know that not only will their lives not get better, they will get much worse. In the fourth installment in the \"Series of Unfortunate Events,\" the sorrowful siblings, having once again narrowly escaped the clutches of the evil Count Olaf, are escorted by the kindly but ineffectual Mr. Poe to their newest \"home\" at the Lucky Smells Lumbermill. Much to their horror (if not surprise), their dormitory at the mill is crowded and damp, they are forced to work with spinning saw blades, they are fed only one meal a day (not counting the chewing gum they get for lunch), and worst of all, Count Olaf lurks in a dreadful disguise as Shirley the receptionist just down the street. Not even the clever wordplay and ludicrous plot twists could keep this story buoyant--reading about the mean-spirited foreman, the deadly blades, poor Klaus (hypnotized and \"reprogrammed\"), and the relentless hopelessness of the children's situation only made us feel gloomy.

        "B00005QEFD": "Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

A brave New World is rising--a hostile yet beautiful world, filled with innovative gameplay, new strategic scenarios, eye-searing graphics and much more. Welcome to a world calledAge of Empires III.CampaignIn this action adventure tale of historical fiction, players take on the role of Morgan Black and his family, struggling against the hostile wilderness and a mysterious cult that's crept in from Europe.In a series of 24 scenarios divided into three acts, Morgan Black and his descendants help the Aztecs resist conquest by Spanish conquistadors, pit the French against the British in the French and Indian War and help Simon Bolivar lead revolutions in South America.MultiplayerWhether you're searching for a quick game or hoping to talk strategy with friends online,Age of Empires III's Multiplayer site is your community destination.Here, you can play with persistent Home Cities that gain power and strategic options the more games you play, compete for a spot on dozens of ladders, help organize your clan or chat after a game -- all without leaving the multiplayer portal.Fans ofAge of Mythology's Quick Search can still look for games swiftly, while players looking for something specific can browse game lists to find the set of options that matches their tastes.New Feature--Home CitiesThis revolutionary new feature to the RTS landscape is incorporated into all aspects ofAge of Empires III-- from Campaign to Multiplayer -- and is unlike anything you've experienced before.Much like the persistent character from a role-playing game that encourages you to keep playing, your Home City is an important support system to your efforts in the New World. During a game, your Home City can regularly send you supplies or military reinforcements.You are the leader of your colony, but your success brings glory back to Mother Europe. The more games you play, and the better you do, the more powerful your Home City will become. Every few games, you gain the ability to both upgrade and customize your Home City:Upgrade your city by unlocking new types of soldiers or buildings, or improving those you already have.Broaden your tech tree in whatever direction most fits your play style--invest in warships, native alliances, cavalry, artillery or economy.Customize your Home City by changing the appearance of buildings, the weather or even the types of people who walk, work and perform in its streets.Throughout a game, as well as in between games, you can visit your Home City to watch its citizens go about their lives, get an opinion on how you're doing, plot your next move or just marvel at the beautiful sunset.Full 3-D Graphics, Destructible Environments and MoreWe first set out to reproduce the rich detail ofAge of Empires II: Age of Kings. As we strove to make the fascinatingAge of Empires IIItime period come alive, that goal quickly evolved: We at Ensemble Studios wanted to create the best-looking game ever. From the stunning water effects to the hundreds of units battling on-screen, you'll feel like you're a part of the action in the New World.Tone mapping--This photo imaging technique balances the colors in a scene on the fly. The end result is a rich, warm game where bright colors are vibrantly rendered alongside darker counterparts, such as shadows.Lighting and shadows--The sun is always shining inAge of Empires, so it's important that lighting and shadows be an awe-inspiring experience. Units and buildings cast shadows according to a real sun position, and even cast shadows on each other. High Dynamic Range rendering allows us to represent the shiny glints of sunlight that bounce off highly reflective surfaces.Bump and specular mapping--Water glistens like water. Metal shines like metal. These advanced techniques serve to provide an extra level of rendering detail heretofore unseen in real-time strategy (RTS) gaming.Water--We felt that portraying stunning, realistic water effects in the game was so important that we devoted a programmer to it full-time. You'll find the water rich with details like foam near the shore, accurately modeled water motion, flotsam in rivers and realistic water colors. Plus, reflections change with the viewing angle, the angle of sunlight and the motion of the water. The overall effect is breathtaking.Cliffs and Riverbeds--Instead of just stretching terrain, we built a system to attach geometry to the terrain map to allow for realistic overhangs and steep cliffs, from areas like the American Southwest. This effect is supported on random maps too.CivilizationsBritishQuick access to Settlers gives the British one of the strongest economies in the game. The ability to upgrade two key units -- the Musketeer and Hussar -- make the British military formidable in the late game. The British Home City emphasizes improvements to technology and naval warfare.DutchAlthough Dutch Settlers are limited and costly, their civilization makes up for this economic disadvantage by building Banks and generating coin automatically. The Dutch Home City emphasizes upgrades to defense and economy.FrenchAlthough the French economy starts slowly, the Coureur unit, a Villager with strong fighting skills, makes the French difficult to attack early. The French also have the strongest cavalry unit in the game -- the Cuirassier. Plus, the French are experts at allying with the Native Americans.GermanThe Germans have fewer Settlers and therefore a slower economy. Fortunately, both the Settler Wagon and Uhlan cavalry spawn for free from the German Town Center. Plus, the Germans start with the ability to send Mercenaries from their Home City (long before other civilizations can).Native AmericanEuropean civilizations can learn new technologies and gain troops by forging alliances with the Native Americans. A British player who allies with the Iroquois is essentially playing as two civilizations: the British and the Iroquois.OttomanFor the Ottomans, Settlers spawn automatically from the Town Center. Building a Mosque and conducting research help keep that Settler production steady. Befitting their position straddling Europe and Asia, the Ottomans have more unique units than any other civilization.PortugueseStarting the game with two Town Centers, the Portuguese can quickly produce Settlers, control territory or support their allies. The Spyglass ability allows the Portuguese to easily spy on the enemy. The Portuguese also have a strong navy, strong light infantry and the best Dragoons in the game.RussianStarting the game with extra resources but fewer Settlers gives the Russians the flexibility of focusing on economy or an early raid. Russian infantry, individually weak, are trained in blocks at a faster rate, providing the Russians with the opportunity to overwhelm their enemy with greater numbers.SpanishThe Spanish have a strong military, with both hand infantry and cavalry. Flexibility in early shipments from the Home City give the Spanish the option to attack early or set up for a strong, late economy. Spanish Home City improvements benefit soldiers, buildings and naval units.&nbsp;CombatAge of Empires IIIgives players an amazing amount of control over their side of the battlefield.More to command -- Not only are you in command of large and diverse armies of infantry, cavalry and artillery, but also Native American warriors, mercenaries and tall ships.Multiple formations -- You can assign different formations to your army for different strengths and weaknesses, or have the game automatically choose the most appropriate formation. Examples include:Volley -- ranged infantry, like musketeers, take turns firing at enemies ahead of them.Charge -- your soldiers walk, then run into combat. Cavalry wield sabers, and musketeers fix bayonets.

        "0060577304": "Journalist Bergreen, who has penned biographies of James Agee, Louis Armstrong, Irving Berlin and Al Capone, superbly recreates Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan's obsessive 16th-century quest, an ill-fated journey that altered Europe's perception of the planet: \"It was a dream as old as the imagination: a voyage to the ends of the earth.... Mariners feared they could literally sail over the edge of the world.\" In 2001, Bergreen traveled the South American strait that bears Magellan's name, and he adds to that firsthand knowledge satellite images of Magellan's route plus international archival research. His day-by-day account incorporates the testimony of sailors, Francisco Albo's pilot's log and the eyewitness accounts of Venetian scholar Antonio Pigafetta, who was on the journey. Magellan's mission for Spain was to find a water route to the fabled Spice Islands, and in 1519, the Armada de Molucca (five ships and some 260 sailors) sailed into the pages of history. Many misfortunes befell the expedition, including the brutal killing of Magellan in the Philippines. Three years later, one weather-beaten ship, \"a vessel of desolation and anguish,\" returned to Spain with a skeleton crew of 18, yet \"what a story those few survivors had to tell-a tale of mutiny, of orgies on distant shores, and of the exploration of the entire globe,\" providing proof that the world was round. Illuminating the Age of Discovery, Bergreen writes this powerful tale of adventure with a strong presence and rich detail.

        "0060084332": "In reading and analyzing the great body of tactical and operational literature published by French soldiers and academicians in the interwar period, Loyola English professor and film critic Mosier, who is fluent in French, brings to light a perspective generally neglected by historians who prefer to tell the war's story from a German or British view. For most of WWI, Mosier reminds us, it was the French who held most of the front and did most of the dying. In contrast to the German army's systematic success at technical and tactical innovation, Mosier finds that French and British generals \"solved\" battlefield problems by throwing shells and bodies at them, then concealing the gruesome results from their governments and their people. Allied victory, he argues, depended on an American Expeditionary Force whose commander, Gen. John J. Pershing, saw through the pretensions of his counterparts in command, and insisted on fighting the war in his own way. While Mosier's argument is eloquently presented, scholars of the period will find it consistently spoiled by overstatement; the German army of WWI as described by most historians is nothing like the tempered and perfected instrument described in these pages, and Mosier's notion of Verdun as a German victory was not likely to be found in the ranks or the headquarters of the divisions who fought there. Still, this is the best narrative account in English of the Franco-German combat in central and in southern France from the aftermath of the Marne in 1914 to the end of Verdun in 1916. Buffs and scholars will take note, but the detailed maps, charts and technical focus will put off generalists.Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

Refreshingly, Coyle (Hardball) displays neither. The journalist moved to Armstrong's training base in Spain to cover the months leading up to the cyclist's sixth Tour de France victory in 2004, and the resulting comfort level of Coyle with his subject is palpable. Armstrong emerges from these pages as neither the cancer-surviving saint his American fans admire, nor the soulless, imperialist machine his European detractors hate. Instead, he comes across as a preternaturally gifted athlete barely removed from the death-defying hellion he was as a teenager, fanatically disciplined, gregarious and generous but with a legendarily icy temper. Coyle sweeps over the basics of Armstrong's Texas childhood and fight with cancer, concentrating on his obsessive training&mdash;this is a sport where results are measured in ounces and microseconds. He's sometimes too loose with his writing, digressing as though he had all the time in the world, but he tightens up for the grand finale: the Tour.

He has shared these PostSecrets on his award-winning blog, www.PostSecret.com, in an internationally traveling art exhibit, and in three electrifying books: the bestsellingPostSecret, My Secret,andThe Secret Lives of Men and Women.Now, in his most extraordinary book yet, Warren again delves into our collective confessions, presenting a never-before-seen selection of provocative and moving PostSecrets.A Lifetime of Secretslays bare our private fears, hopes, regrets, and desires, from people as young as eight and as old as eighty. From painful admissions of infidelity to breathtaking revelations and endearing sentiments, Warren's latest collection will shock and move readers of every age, revealing secrets that have haunted their creators for a lifetime.Six PostSecrets fromA Lifetime of SecretsHere are six of the PostSecrets included inA Lifetime of Secrets, and never before seen online. Click on each image to see a larger version.Frank Warren's Introduction toA Lifetime of SecretsWhen I told my father I was collecting secrets from strangers for an art project, he didn&#x92;t know what to think. I tried to explain how the thousands of secrets that had been mailed to me were more than mere confessions. They could be beautiful, funny, sorrowful, inspiring.\"But, Frank,\" he asked, \"why are you soliciting secrets from strangers, and why would anyone tell you a real secret?\"I invited my father to fly out for a PostSecret art exhibit in Washington, D.C., where hundreds of the postcards were on display. More than 15,000 people came to see the secrets, and my father was there, day after day, to hear many of their transformative stories. Some people told me they recognized a hidden part of themselves on a stranger&#x92;s postcard. Others shared personal experiences of how talking about a painful secret had helped heal a lifelong relationship.The exhibit came to an end and I took my father back to the airport to catch a red-eye flight home. During our drive we passed through a long dark stretch of highway when my father broke the silence by asking me, \"Do you want to know my secret?\" He bravely recounted a traumatic childhood experience. When he finished, we had a true talk that gave me a richer understanding of my father and recast our relationship.&#x95; &#x95; &#x95;ForA Lifetime of Secrets, the fourth PostSecret book, I've selected postcards that show how secrets can reveal a momentary impulse or haunt us for decades and arranged them by age to follow the common journey we all take through childhood, adolescence, adulthood, maturity. Stretched over a full lifespan, the secrets expose the meaningful ways we change over time, and the surprising ways we don't.The postcards narrate childhood stories that have never been spoken; they voice the guarded confessions of our parents and grandparents. They confirm that our rich interior lives are not defined by how old we are, and that with aging comes not only loss but also the possibility of grace and wisdom.The following two secrets arrived in my mailbox the same week. The postmarks on each card were different, but when I posted them together on the PostSecret website (www.postsecret.com) they seemed as though they could have been written by the same person at two different points in her life.I am a junior in high school. I have good friends and a loving family. I am smart. I am a good athlete and musician. But I would trade all that in if it meant I would be beautiful.I spent my high school years believing I was UGLY. I just went through a photo album that had pictures of me over the last 20 years. Turns out I was/am kind of cute. No more wasting time on thinking otherwise.&#x95; &#x95; &#x95;When I give PostSecret presentations at college campuses, my hope is that people I have never met will be inspired to change their lives through the secrets and stories being shared. Not long ago, at one of my talks, it was my life that was changed, and the secret that inspired me came from a stranger in the front row.I began my presentation by handing out blank postcards to everyone in the auditorium. I invited each person to anonymously write down a secret on a card and then pass it on. For the next hour, the postcards circulated and were read silently multiple times. At the end of my talk, I asked if anyone would like to stand and read the secret they were holding at that moment. A man in the front row stood up and haltingly read:I wish I could apologize to my younger brother for the way I treated him growing up.He sat down and exchanged a long look with the young man next to him. After more volunteers read aloud some of the other secrets that had been passed around, I collected all the cards. The man in the front row handed me the postcard he had read from, and the two men walked out together.His postcard was blank.I have witnessed many times how the courage of sharing a secret can be contagious. When I realized that the man had been pretending to read someone else&#x92;s secret and that the person he had left with was likely his brother, I was inspired.Growing up, I was not an ideal older brother. As an adult, I have wished for an opportunity to apologize for some of my actions but did not want to open old wounds. I have not shared this secret with my brother . . . until now.--Frank Warren",

Eleanor Fitt is in a troublesome spot. Her brother is missing, her mother refuses to acknowledge the sorry state of their finances and is trying to marry her off to the highest bidder, and the dead are walking. She goes to the Spirit-Hunters determined to find out what really happened to her brother. Instead of answers she finds more questions: Why are the Spirit-Hunters here? Are they causing the trouble with the dead, or are they simply patsies? And, more importantly, why is everyone associated with her brother dying in such a dramatic way?

Switching uncomfortably at times from dialogue in a rough patois to exposition in a language both formal and sociological, George delivers a stinging indictment of a society unable to respond effectively to the needs of its poorer citizens. Kendra Osborne, a 40-year-old woman with modest ambitions and plans to achieve them, has no idea how to cope when her mother \"dumps\" her sister's three children on her doorstep and heads for Jamaica. Fifteen-year-old Ness, 11-year-old Joel and seven-year-old Toby each have a wealth of problems exacerbated by their mixed-race heritage. It's no accident that George refers to Dickens on the first page of this earnest but perhaps overly didactic novel, which focuses on the burdens borne by Joel as he's swept by forces he can neither understand nor control into a fatal encounter.8-city author tour.

Childhood friends Tara, Katherine, and Fintan muddle along, dealing with  the indignities and inconveniences we all face--and then some. Tara's perfectly  horrible, freeloading boyfriend Thomas watches her diet like a hawk and remarks  cruelly on the size of her posterior, comparing her unfavorably to younger,  thinner women. Katherine is a professional success, but her personal life is  nonexistent. Every one of her prior relationships--six in all--has ended  disastrously, with Katherine getting dumped. Each time, she retreats further and  further into her shell, until her most intimate relationship is with her remote  control.

Collins and his team of researchers began their quest by sorting through a list of 1,435 companies, looking for those that made substantial improvements in their performance over time. They finally settled on 11--including Fannie Mae, Gillette, Walgreens, and Wells Fargo--and discovered common traits that challenged many of the conventional notions of corporate success. Making the transition from good to great doesn't require a high-profile CEO, the latest technology, innovative change management, or even a fine-tuned business strategy. At the heart of those rare and truly great companies was a corporate culture that rigorously found and promoted disciplined people to think and act in a disciplined manner. Peppered with dozens of stories and examples from the great and not so great, the book offers a well-reasoned road map to excellence that any organization would do well to consider.

An artist who has found great success recycling junk into angry visual art, Annie is ambivalent about marrying Viveca, the art dealer responsible for her success. Meanwhile, Annie&#x2019;s ex-husband, Orion, struggles to accept Annie&#x2019;s remarriage and remake himself after messing up his career as a psychologist. And their kids are not exactly all right either. But, in classic Lamb fashion, this is less a story about the drama of the present or any of the various hot-button issues Lamb invokes (gay marriage, Christian Fundamentalism, Obama&#x2019;s presidency) than it is a lesson about how the traumas of the past play themselves out in the present, and how moral courage and religious faith are the key to overcoming that which haunts us. Here the old wounds are deep indeed&#x2014;abandonment, addiction, decades-old racial conflict, and lots of child abuse&#x2014;and Lamb does not hold back describing them in all their messiness. As he did in his Oprah-endorsed blockbusters She&#x2019;s Come Undone (1992) and I Know This Much Is True (1998), Lamb avoids irony and tends to spoon-feed his readers rather than let them find their own meanings in the text.

        "0062079603": "*Starred Review* The ratification of the U.S. Constitution in 1788 provided a common legal and political framework to bind 13 supposedly sovereign states to a stronger federal government. But the U.S. was still more of a theoretical nation than an actual one. The War of 1812 and the Mexican War engendered surges of nationalism, but it required a Civil War to administer the death blow to the most extreme forms of sectionalism. Winchester, the widely acclaimed author, is a native of Great Britain who recently became an American citizen. His focus here is on the more subtle aspects of nation building. He examines the accomplishments of a variety of characters, some famous and some obscure, whose visions and mastery of emerging technologies drew Americans closer together as our geographic size expanded. Thomas Jefferson&#x2019;s vision of an &#x201C;empire of liberty&#x201D; led to the acquisition of the Louisiana Territory and the Lewis and Clark expedition. William Maclure, a hyperactive Scottish immigrant, provided a geological survey of vast areas of the eastern U.S. and then promoted the value of a practical education for ordinary citizens. Winchester provides a fascinating portrayal of Samuel Morse, the &#x201C;man who tamed the lightning,&#x201D; and the vital role of the telegraph in bridging distances. This is a finely crafted and valuable reminder that the evolution of our united nation was a process often accelerated by unlikely, sometimes eccentric men who operated outside the political sphere.

        "0060799250": "Any memoir based on the scandal of the moment must begin with a bang, and Frey's account of her relationship with Scott Peterson certainly does. The first seven pages race breathlessly through that first evening in November 2002 when she met Peterson on a blind date: flirting with him over dinner, splurging on gin & tonics, singing some tipsy karaoke duets and returning to Peterson's hotel for what she acknowledged the next day \"felt like a one-night stand.\" Frey then proceeds to tell the story that is doubtless familiar to throngs of gossip hounds. She describes how Peterson seduced her with his charm, charisma and apparently paternal feelings towards her young daughter. Frey also details her growing suspicions about her mysterious new boyfriend, fears that were realized when a friend finally connected the dots for her and Frey learned that Peterson was in fact married, that his pregnant wife was missing and that he was the prime suspect in the case. From there, it was just a short step to becoming a police informant and, ultimately, the key witness against Peterson at his double murder trial. Frey includes all the sordid highlights: secret tape recordings, TV makeovers, nude photographs, personal betrayals, and, always, the merciless hounding of the press. Frey portrays herself as an honest, decent young woman (the book is liberally sprinkled with Bible quotations) caught up in the whirlwind of a real-life melodrama. As forgettable as it was inevitable, mercifully short on biographical background, Frey's memoir delivers all the behind-the-scenes details that readers will want as the players in the Peterson saga quit the public stage.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

While living beneath the Earth's surface, the D'ni practiced what they called the \"Art of Writing,\" which enabled them to create links to incredible, alternate worlds of fantastic variety called \"Ages,\" to which they could travel through \"Linking Books.\"The D'ni people thrived for thousands of years, but later met with a great catastrophe that all but ended their civilization. Their vast cavern was left uninhabited, and their Linking Books and Ages seemed lost forever.See more picturesThen, in the late 1980s, a few humans from the surface discovered that cavern. One of these humans was Elias Zandi. He devoted the rest of his life to exploring and, eventually, restoring that ancient city in the D'ni cavern, preparing to one day reveal their discovery to those who were suddenly feeling irresistibly drawn to the cavern.When he passed away in 1996, his legacy was divided between a foundation that he set up and his only son, Jeff Zandi.

In it we find our obsessive-compulsive heroine, Catherine Bailey, checking and rechecking her door locks six times, eschewing red clothing, shopping only on certain days--clearly something horrible has happened, and Haynes masterfully teases out the disturbing details, which involve a Jekyll and Hyde boyfriend. As the story unfolds, it provides subtle insight into why, despite red flags and bruises, someone would stay in an abusive relationship, and it makes you root for Catherine all the more to overcome the psychological fallout. If you're a fan of cinematic showdowns, you won't be disappointed. But the quietly powerful moments in Haynes' narrative resonate even more, as she illustrates that one of the bravest things someone can do is lock the door behind her, maybe five or six times, and step out into an uncertain world again.--Erin Kodicek",

        "0060539097": "With its wit (the book is dedicated to Onan), its victim narrative (multiple sexual assaults), its celebrity dish (Howard Stern is actually well endowed), and its frank, one-fisted prose style (\"After three hours of sweaty, psychotic sex, she handed me a huge black strap-on\"), the queen of porn's autobiography is destined to become a lowbrow classic. Jameson's career began at 16, when she fell for Jack, a tattoo artist. At a party, Jack's neo-Nazi uncle raped Jameson. Unable to face her father, a Las Vegas cop, she moved in with Jack. Within a year, she went from high school cheerleader to stripper to nude model to porn actress, with a stop along the way to become a crack addict. Jameson's life wasn't so much a downward spiral as a freefall into darkness. But, as the porn world would have it, the harder she fell, the more everyone wanted her, and she quickly became a top nude model and porn star, and the country's highest-paid feature dancer, all while leaving a path of carnage worthy of several rock bands. Beneath Jameson's monstrous diva exterior, however, was a girl who just wanted to become a loving mother and wife. After many failures, she finally succeeded, and her X-rated book ends on an uplifting family-values note. Jameson's life was a mess, and with its multiple formats (interview transcripts, movie scripts, advice sidebars, diary entries, cartoon strips), so is this book. But it's a remarkably appealing and honest mess, and should earn Jameson some of the mainstream acceptance she so clearly desires.

        "0061438456": "Frank (Sullivan's Island) creates a world in which aspiring writer Beth Hayes, whose chirpy internal monologues and quiet uncertainties make her easily endearing, is as much a character as the house she lives in. After graduating from college in Boston, Beth returns to the South to spend a year house-sitting her family's home, Island Gamble, while her mother, Susan, visits Paris. Frank's portrayal of a large and complicated family is humorous and precise: there's Susan, adoring and kind; Aunt Maggie, a stickler for manners; twin aunts Sophie and Allison, who run an exercise-and-vitamin empire; and uncles Timmy and Henry, the latter of whom has ties to Beth's trust fund. Frank's lovable characters occasionally stymie her pace; there's almost no room left for Beth's friends or her love affairs with sleazy Max Mitchell and cherubic Woody Morrison, though these become important later on. Frank is frequently funny, and she weaves in a dark undercurrent that incites some surprising late-book developments. Tight storytelling, winsomely oddball characters and touches of Southern magic make this a winner.(July)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A witty omniscient narrator speaks directly to modern readers and follows 15-year-old Penelope, recent graduate of the Swanburne Academy for Poor Bright Females, to British country manor Ashton Place, where conniving Lord Fredrick has discovered three wild children apparently raised by wolves while hunting in his vast forest property. To Lord Fredrick, who's named them Alexander, Beowulf, and Cassiopeia Incorrigible, the children are trophies and property (\"Finder's keepers, what?\"); to young Lady Constance they're savage nuisances who howl, chase squirrels, and gnaw on shoes. Enter Penelope Lumley, charged with taming them in time for a Christmas party, and bolstered by her top-notch classical education and an endless supply of platitudes from Agatha Swanburne. She also comes armed with a cherished book of poetry and her favorite fiction series, \"Giddy-Yap, Rainbow!\" There are stock characters, and there are mysteries. Most of all, without taking itself too seriously, there is commentary on writing itself, the dangers and the benefits of relying on books for moral courage, and the perils of drawing false expectations of the world from literature. Penelope shows growth, confronting issues of social class and expectation versus reality, and eventually realizing her own capacity for insight. Humorous antics and a climactic cliff-hanger ending will keep children turning pages and clamoring for the next volume, while more sophisticated readers will take away much more.

Yet salt, Kurlansky asserts, has \"shaped civilization.\" Although now taken for granted, these square crystals are not only of practical use, but over the ages have symbolized fertility (it is, after all, the root of the word \"salacious\") and lasting covenants, and have been used in magical charms. Called a \"divine substance\" by Homer, salt is an essential part of the human body, was one of the first international commodities and was often used as currency throughout the developing world. Kurlansky traces the history of salt's influences from prehistoric China and ancient Africa (in Egypt they made mummies using salt) to Europe (in 12th-century Provence, France, salt merchants built \"a system of solar evaporation ponds\") and the Americas, through chapters with intriguing titles like \"A Discourse on Salt, Cadavers and Pungent Sauces.\" The book is populated with characters as diverse as frozen-food giant Clarence Birdseye; Gandhi, who broke the British salt law that forbade salt production in India because it outdid the British salt trade; and New York City's sturgeon king, Barney Greengrass. Throughout his engaging, well-researched history, Kurlansky sprinkles witty asides and amusing anecdotes.

The ensuing consequences and Samantha's conflicted feelings about sex provide drama.

The themes are more mature than those of The Princess Diaries series.

Teen sexuality and honesty about protection, awkwardness, and masturbation are handled in a humorous and sensitive manner.

In \"Dundun\" the narrator decides to take a shooting victim to the hospital, though not for the usual reasons: \"I wanted to be the one who saw it through and got McInnes to the doctor without a wreck. People would talk about it, and I hoped I would be liked.\" Later he takes his own pathetic stab at violence in \"The Other Man,\" attempting to avenge a drug rip-off but succeeding only at terrorizing an innocent family. Each meandering story--some utterly lacking in the usual elements of plot, including a beginning and an end--nonetheless demands compulsive reading, with Denis  Johnson's first calling as a poet apparent in the off-kilter beauty of his prose. Open to any page and gems spill forth: \"I knew every raindrop by its name. I sensed everything before it happened. I knew a certain Oldsmobile would stop for me even before it slowed, and by the sweet voices of the family inside that we'd have an accident in the storm.\"The most successful stories in the collection offer moments of startling clarity. In \"Car Crash While Hitchhiking,\" for instance, the narrator feels most  alive while in the presence of another's loss: \"Down the hall came the wife. She was glorious, burning. She didn't know yet that her husband was dead....  What a pair of lungs! She shrieked as I imagined an eagle would shriek. It felt wonderful to be alive to hear it! I've gone looking for that feeling everywhere.\" In \"Work,\" while \"salvaging\" copper wire from a flooded house to fund their habits, the narrator and an acquaintance stop to watch the nearly unfathomable sight of a beautiful, naked woman paragliding up the river. Later the narrator learns that the house once belonged to his down-and-out accomplice and that the woman is his estranged wife. \"As nearly as I could tell, I'd wandered into some sort of dream that Wayne was having about his wife, and his house,\" he reasons. Such is the experience for the reader. More Genet than Bukowski, Denis Johnson lures us into a misfit soul's dream from which he can't awake.--Langdon Cook",

This time philosophical serial killer Serge is working for his Hammett-channeling friend Mahoney to track the worst offenders in an epidemic of scam artistry. Harnessing the power of metadata (no one said this book isn&#x2019;t smart), Serge and Coleman uncover a dazzling string of culprits. Then they dispatch them in a series of science experiments intricately plotted to amuse Serge and make ironic statements. Serge punctuates his hunt for miscreants with tours of Florida attractions (LEGOLAND, Tupperware Confidence Center), a mission to unite the Democratic and Republican parties, and a plot to avenge his love Felicia&#x2019;s murder. This strong entry in the long-loved series is an incisive, darkly humorous road trip; perfect for those weary of Dexter&#x2019;s sobriety, and a great crossover match with Christopher Moore&#x2019;s adventures (Sacr&#xE9; Bleu, 2012). --Christine Tran",

Frank Baum'sTheWonderful Wizard of Oz \"occupies a unique position in the cultural fabric of this country.\" Editor Peter Glassman (Oz: The HundredthAnniversary Celebration) calls the story \"quintessentially American.\" Yet it has a universal appeal--which may account for its translation into many different languages. Although children are often first introduced to the Land of Oz by the classic 1939 movie, the original novel and its many sequels have enchanted both young and old over the years. Published for the centennial, several new books commemorate the beloved story. Readers unacquainted with Oz are sure to find a pleasing version; readers who already know the story will find something to delight them all over again.InOz: The Hundredth Anniversary Celebration,Peter Glassman presents art and words from children's book authors and illustrators who are big fans of Oz and here pay homage to \"the enchanted land that inspired them and helped shape their imaginations.\" The paintings, in each artist's recognizable style, lovingly convey the essence of Oz, making this truly wonderful. Contributions come from Tomie dePaola, who imagines himself going down the yellow brick road instead of Dorothy; Paul O. Zelinsky, who shared the Oz experience with his children; Uri Shulevitz, who escaped from hunger and war during the 1940s in the pages ofThe Wonderful Wizard of Oz; Richard Egielski, whose childhood defense against the ghastly flying monkeys was to lie absolutely still in bed; Natalie Babbitt, Peter Sis, Bruce Degen, Lloyd Alexander, and many others. Proceeds from the sale of the book will be donated to Reading Is Fundamental (RIF).Then there's Robert Sabuda's extraordinary pop-up version. On the first double-page spread, the fearful cyclone whirls up to loom over the tiny farm house in Kansas; in the next spread, the house stands squarely on top of the Wicked Witch of the East. And so it goes, spread after spread. The story itself is condensed and told on foldout booklets attached to the pages. The standout pop-ups are prints created from cut blocks of linoleum, with sparkling touches of colored foil that add pizzazz. Sabuda's art evokes that of Denslow, including the silver, rather than ruby, slippers, and once again, his mastery of his craft enhances and enchants. A good selection for story hours.Also now available is Henry Holt's reissue of its 1982 version of the book, with artwork by the well-known children's book illustrator Michael Hague. It contains several new pictures and a slightly longer profile of Baum. It's certainly not an essential purchase, but it's a gorgeous edition for collections that don't have the earlier volume.Last, but certainly not least, isThe Wonderful Wizard of Oz,the \"100th Anniversary Edition,\" part of the HarperCollins Books of Wonder imprint. For those who want the look and feel of the 1900 publication, this fills the bill. It's a very handsome facsimile, printed on high-quality paper and containing all of W. W. Denslow's 24 original colorplates and 130 two-color drawings. Long live Dorothy and her stalwart companions.Sally EstesCopyright &#169; American Library Association. All rights reserved",

        "0062071041": "Robison Wells Interviews His Brother, Dan WellsDan Wells is the acclaimed author of the John Cleaver series:I Am Not a Serial Killer,Mr. Monster, andI Don&rsquo;t Want to Kill You. He has been nominated for both the Hugo and the Campbell Award and has won two Parsec Awards for his podcastWriting Excuses. Robison Wells, Dan&rsquo;s younger brother, is the author ofVariant, whichPublishers Weeklycalled &ldquo;a chilling, masterful debut&rdquo; in a starred review, and its sequel,Feedback(available Fall 2012). Here, Robison interviews his brother aboutPartials, Dan&rsquo;s pulse-pounding first book in his post-apocalyptic series that questions the very concept of what it means to be human.Robison:Dan is my brother, exactly 13 months older than me. He and I shared a room our entire childhood, took the same classes, even dated the same girls. Dan got me into writing about twelve years ago, and ever since we&rsquo;ve critiqued each other&rsquo;s work, brainstormed new ideas, and told each other how terrible he is. So, with such a long background together, I&rsquo;m particularly interested to see if I can learn anything new in this interview.I&rsquo;ve read so much of your writing over the years, from your poem about turkeys in the fifth grade to your first epic fantasy to your literary farce to your horror, and now your YA post-apocalyptic Partials. Is there anything you&rsquo;ve written that I&rsquo;d be surprised to hear about?Dan:I wrote someRiftsfan fiction in high school&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know if you knew about that. I actually reused a part of it forPartials.Robison:What part?Dan:I won&rsquo;t say, but it&rsquo;s in the first third.Robison:You&rsquo;ve written in all these different genres: Is it because you&rsquo;re still looking for the perfect fit? Or are you just interested in writing lots of different things?Dan:Almost every book I write is a new genre, or a weird combination of genres, because I like to branch out and try new things. I never would have imagined that I&rsquo;d write a horror series, but that was the first book I published. I never would have found that character, or the audience that loves him, if I&rsquo;d forced myself to stick to one thing.Robison:How was the transition from supernatural to sci-fi?Dan:Not too bad, since I see them as very connected&mdash;the only real difference between fantasy and SF is the explanation of where the weird stuff comes from. SF ended up being a lot harder, in some ways, because I had to make those explanations scientifically sound. In my horror series I could just say, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a monster!&rdquo; With SF I had to do a ton of research into genetics, biology, and the science of decay.Robison:How did you do your research?Dan:A lot of my research started online, including Wikipedia&mdash;people make fun of it as a research tool, and I admit that it&rsquo;s a terrible place to end your research, but it&rsquo;s a fantastic place to start. From there I found more detailed websites, and eventually some great connections to books. One of the most useful books I read wasThe World Without Usby Alan Weisman, about what would happen to the things we leave behind if we suddenly weren&rsquo;t there to take care of them. It&rsquo;s a very detailed combination of scientific research and thought experiment.InPartials, the apocalypse wasn&rsquo;t a bomb or a war or anything physically destructive, just a disease: We died, but all our stuff is still just sitting there. It was a fun situation to study, and a blast to depict in a book.Robison:So, having done all that research, what tips would you give for surviving an apocalyptic pandemic? Let&rsquo;s assume you&rsquo;re immune to the virus.Dan:I don&rsquo;t know how you&rsquo;re going to work that out, but there you go. Once you have that taken care of, you live in a combination of paradise and medieval squalor. You will have no electricity or running water, but almost everything else will be free. Canned food can last for a decade or more before going bad, so you can live at a subsistence level just by scavenging the local stores.Robison:Why do you think your society of survivors ended up being organized and civil and less Mad Max-ish?Dan:A big part of it is the scarcity issue. Mad Max and similar apocalyptic scenarios start with the premise that everything is destroyed. The survivors have to fight tooth and nail for what little resources are left. InPartials, everything you could ever want is just there for the taking.Robison:What books/movies/music/TV influencedPartials?Dan:Some of the influences are obvious, likeBattlestar GalacticaandChildren of Men. Others are harder to spot. I listened to a steady diet of protest songs and revolutionary music while writing, stuff like &ldquo;Uprising&rdquo; by Muse, because they got my blood going and helped me get into the main character&rsquo;s fiery personality. And some of my influences didn&rsquo;t really end up in the book, though I still count them&mdash;things likeMad MaxandA Canticle for Leibowitzthat inspired my love of post-apocalyptic stories, but which didn&rsquo;t really apply in this case.The biggest influence may have been our own history and current events.Partialsis, at times, a very angry book, and that&rsquo;s a reflection of my own feelings about a lot of the stuff I see going on in the world.Robison:Let&rsquo;s talk about that. You&rsquo;ve said before that you think one of the reasons dystopia is so popular right now is because our world is becoming more dystopian. What current events influenced you inPartials?Dan:For example, the story is set eleven years after a devastating catastrophe&mdash;and in 2012, my readers are also eleven years after their own devastating catastrophe. The events of 9/11 changed the way we do almost everything in this country, and to a lesser extent the rest of the world. One of the things I tried to do in the book was show that the adults, who remember what life was like before the end of the world, have a very different attitude about it than the kids who&rsquo;ve never really known any other life.I also tried to throw in a lot of the extreme measures our government and our culture in general have taken in response to terrorism&mdash;reduced privacy, indefinite detention, torture, and so on. I think there are arguments on both sides of all these issues, and I tried to give each side a fair shake. Kira, the main character, has very strong ideas about what&rsquo;s justifiable and what&rsquo;s not, and just because she&rsquo;s the main character doesn&rsquo;t mean she&rsquo;s always right. If anyone&rsquo;s actually &ldquo;right&rdquo; at all.Robison:So, on a happier note, why do you think I&rsquo;m so awesome?Dan:Because you take after your brother.",

Now the Vancouver-based entrepreneur traverses the continent with his \"Millionaire Mind Intensive Seminar,\" on which this debut motivational business manual is based. What sets it apart is Eker's focus on the way people think and feel about money and his canny, class-based analyses of broad differences among groups. In rat-a-tat, \"Let me explain\" seminar-speak, Eker asks readers to think back to their childhoods and pick apart the lessons they passively absorbed from parents and others about money. With such psychological nuggets as \"Rich people focus on opportunities/ Poor people focus on obstacles,\" Eker puts a positive spin on stereotypes, arguing that poverty begins, or rather, is allowed to continue, in one's imagination first, with actual material life becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. To that end, Eker counsels for admiration and against resentment, for positivity, self-promotion and thinking big and against wallowing, self-abnegation and small-mindedness. While much of the advice is self-evident, Eker's contribution is permission to think of one's financial foibles as a kind of mental illness&mdash;one, he says, that has a ready set of cures.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Now, in his highly anticipated follow-up, Grogan again works his magic, bringing us the story of what came first.Before there was Marley, there was a gleefully mischievous boy growing up in a devout Catholic home outside Detroit in the 1960s and '70s. Despite his loving parents' best efforts, John's attempts to meet their expectations failed spectacularly. Whether it was his disastrous first confession, the use of his hobby telescope to take in the bronzed Mrs. Selahowski sunbathing next door, the purloined swigs of sacramental wine, or, as he got older, the fumbled attempts to sneak contraband past his father and score with girls beneath his mother's vigilant radar, John was figuring out that the faith and fervor that came so effortlessly to his parents somehow had eluded him.And then one day, a strong-willed young woman named Jenny walked into his life. As their love grew, John began the painful, funny, and poignant journey into adulthood&#8212;away from his parents' orbit and into a life of his own. It would take a fateful call and the onset of illness to lead him on the final leg of his journey&#8212;the trip home again.The Longest Trip Homeis a book for any son or daughter who has sought to forge an identity at odds with their parents', and for every parent who has struggled to understand the values of their children.

Her dialogue sparkles with sassy wit and earthy poetry; her  descriptions are rooted in daily life but are also on familiar terms with the  eternal. WithProdigal Summer, she returns fromthe Congoto a \"wrinkle on the map  that lies between farms and wildness.\" And there, in an isolated pocket of  southern Appalachia, she recounts not one but three intricate stories.Exuberant, lush, riotous--the summer of the novel is \"the season of extravagant  procreation\" in which bullfrogs carelessly lay their jellied masses of eggs in  the grass, \"apparently confident that their tadpoles would be able to swim  through the lawn like little sperms,\" and in which a woman may learn to \"tell  time with her skin.\" It is also the summer in which a family of coyotes moves  into the mountains above Zebulon Valley:The ghost of a creature long extinct was coming in on silent footprints,  returning to the place it had once held in the complex anatomy of this forest  like a beating heart returned to its body. This is what she believed she would  see, if she watched, at this magical juncture: a restoration.The \"she\" is Deanna Wolfe, a wildlife biologist observing the coyotes from her  isolated aerie--isolated, that is, until the arrival of a young hunter who makes  her even more aware of the truth that humans are only an infinitesimal portion  in the ecological balance. This truth forms the axis around which the other two  narratives revolve: the story of a city girl, entomologist, and new widow and  her efforts to find a place for herself; and the story of Garnett Walker and  Nannie Rawley, who seem bent on thrashing out the countless intimate lessons of  biology as only an irascible traditional farmer and a devotee of organic  agriculture can. As Nannie lectures Garnett, \"Everything alive is connected to  every other by fine, invisible threads. Things you don't see can help you  plenty, and things you try to control will often rear back and bite you, and  that's the moral of the story.\"Structurally, that gossamer webisthe story: images, phrases, and events  link the narratives, and these echoes are rarely obvious, always serendipitous.  Kingsolver is one of those authors for whom the terrifying elegance of nature is  both aesthetic wonder and source of a fierce and abiding moral vision. She may  have inherited Thoreau's mantle, but she piles up riches of her own making,  blending her extravagant narrative gift with benevolent concise humor.

        "0061732370": "Product DescriptionThe life Kamila Sidiqi had known changed overnight when the Taliban seized control of the city of Kabul. After receiving a teaching degree during the civil war&mdash;a rare achievement for any Afghan woman&mdash;Kamila was subsequently banned from school and confined to her home. When her father and brother were forced to flee the city, Kamila became the sole breadwinner for her five siblings. Armed only with grit and determination, she picked up a needle and thread and created a thriving business of her own.The Dressmaker of Khair Khanatells the incredible true story of this unlikely entrepreneur who mobilized her community under the Taliban. Former ABC News reporter Gayle Tzemach Lemmon spent years on the ground reporting Kamila's story, and the result is an unusually intimate and unsanitized look at the daily lives of women in Afghanistan. These women are not victims; they are the glue that holds families together; they are the backbone and the heart of their nation.  Afghanistan's future remains uncertain as debates over withdrawal timelines dominate the news.The Dressmaker of Khair Khanamoves beyond the headlines to transport you to an Afghanistan you have never seen before. This is a story of war, but it is also a story of sisterhood and resilience in the face of despair. Kamila Sidiqi's journey will inspire you, but it will also change the way you think about one of the most important political and humanitarian issues of our time.Amazon Exclusive: Greg Mortenson Interviews Gayle Tzemach LemmonSince a 1993 climb of Pakistan's K2,Greg Mortensonhas worked in rural Afghanistan and Pakistan to promote education and literacy--establishing 145 schools, primarily for girls, which provide education to over 64,000 students, including 52,000 females. He is a co-author ofThe New York TimesbestsellersThree Cups of TeaandStones Into Schools.Greg Mortenson:InThe Dressmaker of Khair Khana, Kamila and her sisters sew a collection of wedding dresses overnight for a wedding party they later find out is connected to the Taliban. How did writing this book affect your view of the Taliban period?Gayle Tzemach Lemmon:That scene in the book captures precisely the extraordinary complexity of the period. Reporting on the Taliban period I quickly learned there were many different views of what those years were like, depending on who you were, what you did, and where you lived. A lot of women I knew, including, of course, Kamila, told me stories about local Talibs who knew of their work and even helped them to keep it going.  And they said that many of the Taliban in their neighborhood were men they had known for years who simply needed to support their families.What I kept coming back to&mdash;and what moved me deeply during so many conversations  with young women , some of them tearful&mdash;was the raw loss they felt at having been deprived of five and a half years of education.  And yet even amid all that despair they found ways to come together to build a community for the sake of their families.  We are so used to seeing women as victims of war to be pitied rather than survivors of war to be respected.  I really hopeThe Dressmaker of Khair Khanadoes its small part to change that.Mortenson:How has your work at Harvard Business School informed your view of Afghanistan&rsquo;s predicament?Lemmon:My experience at HBS has made me even more keenly aware of the constellation of obstacles facing entrepreneurs in some of the toughest parts of the world. That&rsquo;s perhaps why I am so taken by stories of entrepreneurs like Kamila who succeed every day despite all the obstacles (and sometimes even because of them).Economic growth strengthens families and communities. More attention must be paid by Afghanistan&rsquo;s leaders and the international community to the importance of making business easier for entrepreneurs, so they can spend time making money to support their families and less time fighting red tape, corruption and security obstacles.Mortenson:In many ways,The Dressmaker of Khair Khanareads like a novel, and yet it is all true. How much energy did you focus on the craft of storytelling vs. the reporting itself?Lemmon:I believe in the power of stories to shape and change our world. The Dressmaker happens to be set in Afghanistan during the Taliban, but it could just as easily have been the US during the Civil War or the UK during World War II. Storytelling allows us to see just how similar our struggles really are. My hope was that my godmother and my aunt, who will never go to Afghanistan, could pick up this book and see themselves in this universal story of family and faith.For me, the reporting is where the joy is&mdash;it&rsquo;s a privilege to be allowed to take a step into people&rsquo;s lives and to be entrusted with telling their story. In this case the reporting was much more physically difficult than the storytelling&mdash;the fall of 2008 in particular was a time during which kidnappings and bombings became regular occurrences in Kabul; both Afghans and foreigners I visited with constantly swapped stories of terrifying incidents which involved their friends and relatives. I knew a lot of people who were affected by the violence, and all the insecurity made it much harder to convince young women to speak with me about their experiences.Mortenson:You&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time on the ground in Afghanistan. What is it like to travel there as a young woman?Lemmon:I love going to Afghanistan, though the trip from California is nearly 40 hours. It is a beautiful country with incredibly generous people who will give you anything they have even if it is all they have. (And I highly recommend the food!)Being a young woman actually made my work easier. I could meet women of all ages and spend time with them at their homes hearing their stories and sharing my own.  This is a world many foreign men will never have access to, for cultural reasons. I also could meet Afghan men because, as a foreign woman, you sort of fit a third category&mdash;not male, but not exactly female, either. I worked hard to build trust with those women and men who entrusted me with their stories&mdash;I tried to learn Dari and to draw as little attention to my &lsquo;foreign-ness&rsquo; as possible: I often was the frumpiest woman I saw all day in my uniform of black pants, black socks, black shoes, black t-shirt, and a dark jacket and head scarf. I think those I wrote about respected the fact that I kept coming back to Afghanistan.Mortenson:You've worked and studied in conflict and post-conflict regions such as Rwanda, Bosnia and Afghanistan. Women are rarely involved in the high level decision making that affects conflict negotiations or even consulted about their own creative ideas for resolution. How can we help and empower women to play a much larger role in resolving conflicts?Lemmon:This is a question I think about all the time. We are used to women pulling families through war, but having no say in the peace which follows. This must change for the world to be a safer, more stable place.A great example has been set by the women of Liberia, who insisted their voices be heeded when it came time for UN negotiations to end their nation&rsquo;s civil war. (There is a great film about their push to be heard called &ldquo;Pray the Devil Back to Hell.&rdquo;) Afghan women, too, are speaking up to make sure that no peace negotiations happen without their real and substantive representation. Each one of us can help advance their cause and this effort by insisting that our own elected officials don&rsquo;t take part in any talks in which women don&rsquo;t take part. Holding our own leaders accountable is a great place to start.",

It took just an hour and a half to wipe out 3.5 billion people and 10,000 years of civilization, plunging humanity into a hopeless Dark Age. In the aftermath, survivors in Moscow moved underground and slowly organized into small socially and politically independent tribes, clustered around the city's deep, subway stations. The young man, Artyom is among them. A member of the first generation of children raised in the subterranean world following the apocalypse, he has only the vaguest recollections of life above ground, and contact with other humans beyond those that inhabit his local station, \"Exhibition,\" but he will have to face new experiences with both if humanity is to survive. Mutated beasts known as \"Dark Ones\" are spreading throughout the isolated stations of the Metro, and Artyom has been chosen as the messenger to spread the news of the new peril.",

He decides to attend Harvard University to study English. During his studies, he rankles under his writing professors' criticism. As an act of rebellion, Crichton submits an essay by George Orwell as his own. The professor doesn&#x92;t catch the plagiarism and gives Orwell a B-. This experience convinces Crichton to change his field of study to anthropology.1964:Crichton graduates summa cum laude from Harvard University in anthropology. After studying further as a visiting lecturer at Cambridge University and receiving the Henry Russell Shaw Travelling Fellowship, which allowed him to travel in Europe and North Africa, Crichton begins coursework at the Harvard School of Medicine. To help fund his medical endeavors, he writes spy thrillers under several pen names. One of these works,A Case of Need, wins the 1968 Mystery Writers of America's Edgar Allan Poe Award.1969:Crichton graduates from Harvard Medical school and is accepted as a post-doctoral fellow at the Salk Institute for Biological Science in La Jolla, Calif. However, his career in medicine is waylaid by the publication of the first novel under his own name,The Andromeda Strain. The novel, about an apocalyptic plague, climbs high on bestseller lists and is later made into apopular film. Crichton said of his decision to pursue writing full time: \"To quit medicine to become a writer struck most people like quitting the Supreme Court to become a bail bondsman.\"1972:Crichton's second novel under his own nameThe Terminal Man, is published. Also, two of Crichton's previous works under his pen names,DealingandA Case of Needare made into movies. After watching the filming, Crichton decides to try his hand at directing. He will eventually direct seven films including the 1973 science-fiction hitWestworld, which was the first film ever to use computer-generated effects.1980:Crichton draws on his anthropology background and fascination with new technology to createCongo, a best-selling novel about a search for industrial diamonds and a new race of gorillas. The novel, patterned after the adventure writings of H. Ryder Haggard, updates the genre with the inclusion of high-tech gadgets that, although may seem quaint 20 years later, serve to set Crichton's work apart and he begins to cement his reputation as \"the father of the techno-thriller.\"1990:After the 1980s, which saw the publication of the underwater adventureSphere(1987) and an invitation to become a visiting writer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1988), Crichton begins the new decade with a bang via the publication of his most popular novel,Jurassic Park. The book is a powerful example of Crichton's use of science and technology as the bedrock for his work. Heady discussion of genetic engineering, chaos theory, and paleontology run throughout the tightly-wound thriller that strands a crew of scientists on an island populated by cloned dinosaurs run amok. The novel inspires the 1993Steven Spielberg film, and together book and film will re-ignite the world&#x92;s fascination with dinosaurs.1995:Crichton resurrects an idea from his medical school days to create the Emmy-Award Winning television seriesER. In this year,ERwon eight Emmys and Crichton received an award from the Producers Guild of America in the category of outstanding multi-episodic series. Set in an insanely busy an often dangerous Chicago emergency room, the fast-paced drama is defined by Crichton's now trademark use of technical expertise and insider jargon. The year also saw the publication ofThe Lost Worldreturning readers to the dinosaur-infested island.2000:In recognition for Crichton's contribution in popularizing paleontology, a dinosaur discovered in southern China is named after him. \"Crichton's ankylosaur\" is a small, armored plant-eating dinosaur that dates to the early Jurassic Period, about 180 million years ago. \"For a person like me, this is much better than an Academy Award,\" Crichton said of the honor.2004:Crichton&#x92;s newest thrillerState of Fearis published.Amazon.com's Significant SevenMichael Crichton kindly agreed to take the life quiz we like to give to all our authors: the Amazon.com Significant Seven.Q:What book has had the most significant impact on your life?A:Prisoners of Childhoodby Alice MillerQ:You are stranded on a desert island with only one book, one CD, and one DVD--what are they?A:Tao Te Chingby Lao Tzu (Witter Bynner version)Symphony #2 in D Majorby Johannes Brahms (Georg Solti)Ikiruby Akira KurosawaQ:What is the worst lie you've ever told?A:Surely you're joking.Q:Describe the perfect writing environment.A:Small room.

The book went on to win both the Hugo and Nebula Awards, although a large chunk of the story had been cut out before it saw publication.  Now Haldeman and Avon Books have released the definitive version ofThe Forever War, published for the first time as Haldeman originally intended.  The book tells the timeless story of war, in this case a conflict between humanity and the alien Taurans.  Humans first bumped heads with the Taurans when we began using collapsars to travel the stars. Although the collapsars provide nearly instantaneous travel across vast distances, the relativistic speeds associated with the process means that time passes slower for those aboard ship.  For William Mandella, a physics student drafted as a soldier, that means more than 27 years will have passed between his first encounter with the Taurans and his homecoming, though he himself will have aged only a year. When Mandella finds that he can't adjust to Earth after being gone so long from home, he reenlists, only to find himself shuttled endlessly from battle to battle as the centuries pass.--Craig E.

However, the discovery of a letter left behind by his mother leads him to search through his own medical records where he discovers that he was not Blaine's younger brother but his twin.

The late Philip, Viscount Ashton, had a passion for classical antiquity, and Emily, in an attempt to get to know her husband postmortem, uses her newfound independence in London to study it. In the process, she forms a friendship with Cecile du Lac, a Parisian of a certain age, and realizes that there was more to Philip than she realized&mdash;including his genuine passion and love for her. The charming Colin Hargreaves may have been involved with Philip in art forgeries, and Andrew Palmer proposes to Emily and then offers evidence that Philip is still alive. By this time, Emily and Cecile are a well-practiced team of amateur sleuths: Phillip's secrets begin to emerge, and travel to Greece provides the possibilities of a new life.

It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins",

The many clues that Laurel is different (she is strictly vegan; sunlight seems to shine through her fair skin; she never gets cold; she craves the outdoors; she doesn't menstruate) culminate in a bump on her back growing to the size of a softball and blooming into a flower that has foot-long petals. Returning to her parents' land, she meets Tamini, a faerie to whom she is attracted, who tells her that she is not human, but rather is a plant or, more specifically, a faerie.

When a creepy alleged realtor pressures the family to sell the land, the teens become suspicious, and they are soon fighting for their lives in a centuries-old battle between faeries and trolls.

They responded to the intensely introspective nature of the books, and to their lively narrative styles and biting humor. One critic called Wally Lamb a \"modern-day Dostoyevsky,\" whose characters struggle not only with their respective pasts, but with a \"mocking, sadistic God\" in whom they don't believe but to whom they turn, nevertheless, in times of trouble (New York Times).In his new novel,The Hour I First Believed, Lamb travels well beyond his earlier work and embodies in his fiction myth, psychology, family history stretching back many generations, and the questions of faith that lie at the heart of everyday life. The result is an extraordinary tour de force, at once a meditation on the human condition and an unflinching yet compassionate evocation of character.When forty-seven-year-old high school teacher Caelum Quirk and his younger wife, Maureen, a school nurse, move to Littleton, Colorado, they both get jobs at Columbine High School. In April 1999, Caelum returns home to Three Rivers, Connecticut, to be with his aunt who has just had a stroke. But Maureen finds herself in the school library at Columbine, cowering in a cabinet and expecting to be killed, as two vengeful students go on a carefully premeditated, murderous rampage. Miraculously she survives, but at a cost: she is unable to recover from the trauma. Caelum and Maureen flee Colorado and return to an illusion of safety at the Quirk family farm in Three Rivers. But the effects of chaos are not so easily put right, and further tragedy ensues.While Maureen fights to regain her sanity, Caelum discovers a cache of old diaries, letters, and newspaper clippings in an upstairs bedroom of his family's house. The colorful and intriguing story they recount spans five generations of Quirk family ancestors, from the Civil War era to Caelum's own troubled childhood. Piece by piece, Caelum reconstructs the lives of the women and men whose legacy he bears. Unimaginable secrets emerge; long-buried fear, anger, guilt, and grief rise to the surface.As Caelum grapples with unexpected and confounding revelations from the past, he also struggles to fashion a future out of the ashes of tragedy. His personal quest for meaning and faith becomes a mythic journey that is at the same time quintessentially contemporary&#8212;and American.The Hour I First Believedis a profound and heart-rending work of fiction. Wally Lamb proves himself a virtuoso storyteller, assembling a variety of voices and an ensemble of characters rich enough to evoke all of humanity.",

But Rose is different: she has a husband whom she has deserted.

FBI deputy assistant director Kate Bannon tracks down Steve Vail, a maverick FBI agent who left the bureau for a new life as a Chicago bricklayer, because she needs Vail's help in apprehending a criminal gang, the Rubaco Pentad, with a grudge against the FBI. The Pentad follows up the murder of L.A. reporter Connie Lysander, who wrote a story critical of the FBI, with ever-increasing demands for money from the bureau to forestall future killings and the setting of sophisticated death traps. When an agent disappears while making a payoff to the gang, he becomes a prime suspect, despite Vail's reservations.

Their misfortunes begin one gray day on Briny Beach when Mr. Poe tells them that their parents perished in a fire that destroyed their whole house. \"It is useless for me to describe to you how terrible Violet, Klaus, and even Sunny felt in the time that followed,\" laments the personable (occasionally pedantic) narrator, who tells the story as if his readers are gathered around an armchair on pillows. But of course what follows is dreadful. The children thought it was bad when the well-meaning Poes bought them grotesque-colored clothing that itched. But when they are ushered to the dilapidated doorstep of the miserable, thin, unshaven, shiny-eyed, money-grubbing Count Olaf, they know that they--and their family fortune--are in real trouble. Still, they could never have anticipated how much trouble. While it's true that the events that unfold in Lemony Snicket's novels are bleak, and things never turn out as you'd hope, these delightful, funny, linguistically playful books are reminiscent of Roald Dahl (rememberJames and the Giant Peachand his horrid spinster aunts), Charles Dickens (the orphaned Pip inGreat Expectationswithout the mysterious benefactor), and Edward Gorey (The Gashlycrumb Tinies).

        "0062065890": "After a childhood introduction to the fast-paced world of Wall Street, sweetly naive Alex has landed a position at one of the finance industry&#x2019;s most prestigious firms. Instead of being guided through the finer points of bond trading, however, Alex is initially given tasks mostly centered on taking lunch orders and keeping everyone&#x2019;s nicknames straight. As she is accorded more responsibility, the realities of the financial industry and the mostly male egos around her conspire to make her job a little more difficult than she anticipated. Like The Devil Wears Prada (2003) set on Wall Street, Duffy&#x2019;s first novel is a sharp, witty look at the intricacies of the trading floor and the people who populate it. The writing is clever and articulate, and Alex&#x2019;s story of personal growth makes her a sympathetic, likable heroine. Filled with too-good-to-be-true anecdotes and enough of a biting, cynical bent to offset the chick-lit romance angle, Bond Girl is a fun read-alike to the canons of Weisberger, Kinsella, and Green. Duffy&#x2019;s acknowledgment of the recent financial collapse and ensuing recession makes Bond Girl an entertaining and timely read. --Stephanie Turza",

Addison's talent is that of a Divergent, the ability to see into the future and determine which path she should take. With the help of her best friend, she looks forward six weeks and uncovers not only the chance of finding love in both futures, but also the possibility that danger, secrets, and obsession may destroy the lives of those she cares about the most. West has created an intricately woven story of two possible futures, with chapters that alternate between Addie's choices-to stay or to leave. Initially, the two plotlines are fairly divergent, but as the climax builds, the characters and stories begin to merge and the two worlds overlap.

Their tyranny is opposed by retired god Sam, who mocks the Celestial City, introduces Buddhism to subvert Hindu dogma, allies himself with the planet's native \"demons\" against Heaven, fights pyrotechnic battles with bizarre troops and weapons, plays dirty with politics and poison, and dies horribly but won't stay dead. It's a huge, lumbering, magical story, told largely in flashback, full of wonderfully ornate language (and one unforgivable pun) that builds up the luminous myth of trickster Sam, Lord of Light.

Francie learns early the meaning of hunger and the value of a penny. She is her father's child--romantic and hungry for beauty.

Like the Tree of Heaven that grows out of cement or through cellar gratings, resourceful Francie struggles against all odds to survive and thrive.

        "B00009WNZA": "The Simswas one of the most popular games ever made. In it, players micromanage the lives of a family of virtual people, or Sims, and influence their paths toward success or something akin to a nervous breakdown. Its open-ended blend of cartoonish behavior and everyday living is unique in an art form otherwise obsessed with carnage and sports. WithThe Sims 2, long-time fans now have a deeper game with lots of ways to customize and share their experiences. The game will also attract first-timers because the goal-oriented gameplay and the luridly fun starter families make it easier to get into the action right out of the box.Now Sims are born with the traits of their parents, families grow, and Sims grow old.The People in Your NeighborhoodThe game starts at the neighborhood level. Here you can create a housing development from scratch or start with one of three premade neighborhoods, each with its own theme. From there, you'll settle on a house and a family of Sims to control.Create your own Sim (above) or your own house (below) from scratch with advanced tools.Aside from the basic needs carried over from the previous game, Sims now have aspirations, wants, and fears. The wants and fears are the day-to-day things that occupy their minds, like wanting to see friends or get married and fearing death or being rejected for a kiss. Satisfy their wants, and they become more efficient at completing tasks you assign them. Realize their fears, and Sims become lethargic, cranky, and unresponsive to your commands. Aspirations are the big-picture things, like raising a family, becoming wealthy, and gaining knowledge. Succeed here and you'll be able to buy odd gifts for your Sim to improve his or her life, like a money tree that pays dividends or a \"fountain of youth\" water cooler.What Else Is New?Of course, you wouldn't be able to juggle all that if it weren't for the improved \"Free Will\" option, which makes it easier for Sims to fulfill their basic needs. The artificial intelligence of the game is noticeably improved; they won't turn on radios just as a family member is going to bed but, strangely, they do occasionally put their dishes on the floor.Another big change in the series is the concept of the lifespan. Now Sims are born with the traits of their parents, families grow, and Sims grow old. Not only does this go hand in hand with aspirations (growing up is the first aspiration that a baby Sim will have), it provides a limited time with which your Sims can achieve their goals.The Universal Control Panel helps you manage your Sim family.A Family AffairThe Sims 2not only lets you create just about any type of Sim in any type of family, build elaborate houses, and even create a neighborhood from scratch, but it also allows you to start the gamein medias res, with premade households.

Parents of teens shouldn't worry, though, because nudity is tastefully blurred out and \"woo-hoo\" between Sims takes place completely under the covers. The ESRB has given this a Teen rating. IfThe Sims 2were a film, it would likely land between PG and PG-13.The makers have included some nice tools to help share the universe you've created. For example, you can capture in-game stills and video to show friends the private moments, family interactions, and house parties of your Sims. You can even package a household to share as a blog or an album on a special Web site.The Sims 2is for patient gamers. Like life itself, the game is filled with mundane details, like getting ready for work and doing dishes. The game also demands a level of creativity from its players that the run-and-gun game genres wouldn't know what to do with. But those who stick with it will be rewarded with an absorbing, amusing diversion and a virtual family history that they've created themselves.--Porter B.

        "0062009494": "*Starred Review* On a stormy night in early Victorian London, an able young man named Dodger rises from the sewers in response to a scream, fights off two thugs, and rescues a damsel in distress. Dodger continues to rise throughout the novel, as his love for the mysterious lady motivates this tosher (scavenger for lost coins and other treasures in London&#x2019;s sewers) to elevate himself and leads him to a closer acquaintance with a string of historical figures, including Dickens, Disraeli, and ultimately, the queen and her consort. While most writers would be well advised not to include such characters in their books, Pratchett manages to humanize them without diminishing them or throwing the story off-kilter. However lowly Dodger&#x2019;s origins, he remains the most memorable character in the book. Living by his wits and unencumbered by conventional morality, this trickster hero expertly navigates the underbelly of his city as he carries out a bizarre scheme resulting in justice and mercy. The temptation to quote sentences, whole paragraphs, and possibly entire chapters is almost irresistible, because the pleasure of reading the novel is in the language as much as in the characters and well-researched period setting. Often amusing, this Victorian romp of a novel is lovingly crafted and completely enjoyable. Grades 8-12. --Carolyn Phelan",

Although the Arkham asylum is well fortified, he has a nagging feeling that all is not well, which proves to be the case when seconds after turning The Joker over to the guards, the master criminal breaks free of his captors. Even more surprising than this quick turn of events is the revelation that it was never The Joker's intent to escape the vault-like facility, but instead to trap Batman there. Surrounded by an asylum full of dangerous criminals, many of which he put there and all at the beck and call of the Joker, can Batman survive and discover what is behind the Joker's intricate plot?GameplayInBatman: Arkham Asylumplayers strap on the gadget-heavy utility belt of the Caped Crusader. Gameplay here is a combination of both the knuckle crunching rush of hand to hand combat as you take on the hordes of thugs that infest Arkham Asylum, and stealth gameplay in which you must dispatch individuals from the shadows. Players can expect an engrossing single player campaign in which Batman continually moves forward to face the henchmen, bosses and traps that The Joker has set for him. With regards to opponents, in addition to The Joker who you will hear more than you see, the dark walls of Arkham also hold familiar villains from the the Batman criminal universe including Harley Quinn, Victor Zsasz and Killer Croc, that you will have to deal with, but don't expect a one-dimensional experience. As players progress from environment to environment within Arkham they will have to use varying combinations of muscle, detective skills, gadgetry and a certain degree of light RPG-like leveling of Batman's skills, arsenal and physical characteristics to survive and discover what The Joker's underlying scheme is.In addition to the story-driven single player campaignArkham Asylumalso contains various additional play modes. These include an arcade styled combat mode where players accumulate points by engaging hordes of thugs in a hand to hand slugfest across a series of maps, in which Batman's physical strength and agility play a major role. The key here is to chain together as many attacks as possible due to the fact that with each successful combo players increase the point multiplier associated with their actions. The game also features a time-based stealth mode where players must hone their ability to strike silently from the shadows. This gameplay, referred to as 'Invisible Predator' utilizes the Dark Knight's skill with gadgets like the grapple tool, batarang and explosives. These allow for vertical/horizontal mobility, the ability to quickly strike from above and at a distance and to take out enemies and create distractions, even through walls. But remember that Batman works solo and is not superhuman. Your enemies will congregate around trouble areas and work as a team against you, so you must be silent, plan your attacks wisely, strike quickly and discover the value of encouraging fear within enemies.Key FeaturesExperience the game in a whole new way with Game of the Year Edition extras including: Access to the playable Joker character (in the PS3 version only) and 4 additional standard challenge maps.Utilize the unique FreeFlow combat system to chain together unlimited combos seamlessly and battle with huge groups of The Joker's henchmen in brutal melee brawls.Investigate as Batman, the world's greatest detective, by solving intricate puzzles with the help of cutting edge forensic tools including x-ray scanning, fingerprint scans, 'Amido Black' spray and a pheromone tracker.Face off against Gotham's greatest villains including The Joker, Harley Quinn, Victor Zsasz and Killer Croc.Become the Invisible Predator with Batman's fear takedowns and unique vantage point system to move without being seen and hunt enemies.Choose multiple takedown methods, including swooping from the sky and smashing through walls, and use the predator camera get a closer look at the action.Explore every inch of Arkham Asylum and roam freely on the infamous island, presented for the first time ever in its gritty and realistic entirety.Experience what it's like to be Batman using batarangs, explosive gel aerosol, the Batclaw, sonar resonator and the line launcher.Unlock more secrets by completing hidden challenges in the world and develop and customize equipment by earning experience points.Enjoy complete superhero freedom in the environment with the use of Batman's grapple to get to any place you can see, jump from any height and glide in any direction.",

        "B00005B8G1": "The Game Boy platform (which includes the original unit, the Game Boy Pocket, and the Game Boy Color) came to market when most video game consoles had a life expectancy of just a few years. More than a decade later, the system is still going strong. How did the Game Boy successfully compete--and in some cases bury--an onslaught of faster, more powerful handheld and home console systems? Let us count the ways: affordability, a huge library of games that consistently made the most of the hardware's limitations, smart power management that extended battery life, and uncluttered controls. But perhaps it was the system's ultraportable design that allowed devotees to play video games around their schedule, making it the must-have system for kids and adults alike.Now the Game Boy Advance (or GBA as people are already calling it) comes to us with power that would have been unthinkable back in the day. The portable's 32-bit RISC CPU runs circles around the former's 8-bit workhorse, allowing it to process program instructions much faster. What that means to everyday gamers is more intricate visuals, more simultaneous movement on the screen, and better sound. In fact, the often-annoying beeps and boops of old-school Game Boy titles are being replaced with digitized stereo sound. The extra processing muscle also means you can even network up to four Game Boy Advance units together, via the communication cable, for multiplayer fun off of one shared cartridge. Only two Game Boy Color units could link together, and each unit had to have its own copy of the game.What's not being replaced, however, is the wide selection of Game Boy games. Because the Game Boy Advance system is backward-compatible, it will play its own line of colorful games--including such launch titles asSuper Mario Advance,F-Zero: Maximum Velocity,Army Men Advance,High Heat Major League Baseball 2002,Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, andReady 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2--as well as all of the monochrome and color games that have already been released for the previous Game Boy systems (nearly 500 in total). Players can view the older games in their smaller, originally square dimensions, or, with the touch of the shoulder button, expand the game to fit the GBA's larger screen. We tried enlarging the screen on a Game Boy Color edition ofTony Hawk's Pro Skater 2and found that Mr. Hawk was much easier to see.When you first pick up the system, you'll be amazed at how lightweight it is. At fewer than 5 ounces and a little larger than a deck of playing cards, the system easily fits into a shirt pocket without any sag. The GBA's wider shape fits better into a wider range of hands. The former design too often pushed the left and right thumb knuckles together during gameplay. The new layout should be comfortable for all ages, and the center screen orientation makes it easy to see.Game Boy Color owners will find the GBA's larger screen somewhat darker than they're used to, but that's because the screen is outfitted with antiglare technology. Like the old Game Boy Color, the color LCD is not backlit, so you need pretty good light to play by. Unlike that system, though, you won't be craning your neck and tilting the unit to see around the hot-spot reflection of the light bulb in your screen.But you'll also notice the graphics. Sporting what's basically a redesigned SNES technology, you'll see things on the GBA that the big consoles do, such as scaling (making objects larger or smaller) and rotation effects--technological advances that will affect the look of everything from crossing a finish line to throwing a touchdown pass to crawling through a dungeon.Some might argue that Nintendo could have tried to put even more power into this Game Boy Advance. After all, the 32-bit video game had its heyday more than five years ago. Perhaps, but after handling this new handheld, we're inclined to think that Nintendo wisely struck a balance between size, price, and power consumption. And considering how well the old 8-bit system weathered the decade's technological storms, we think the Game Boy Advance is here to stay, and we're glad.--Porter B.

Either way your destiny and those of 255 other fighters awaits on the battlefield ofMAG.GameplayInMAGplayers take on the role of a member of a private military corporation (PMC), in a fictional Earth future. Like most MMO games, as well as some modern shooters, the ultimate goal of action is the leveling up of your character, in this case through success in combat against other factions made up of individual online players. At the initial level players choose the PMC they will be aligned with, the physical characteristics of their character, initial available weaponry, etc. and hit the battlefield with other squad members within a persistent online environment. Along the way you will utilize a diverse skill tree to develop your character's abilities and skills at tactics and weapons using experience points that are accumulated in campaign and mission play in the name of your faction. These points are given out in various increments for all manner of action, whether that be objective completion, or individual actions in combat. Once characters reach a certain level they are eligible to take on command duties. These duties range from leading an eight-man squad, all the way to overall command of more than 100 online players. Orders are communicated and strategy developed via voice chat and other functionality. Success in command positions allows for access to special \"leadership bonuses\" that not only can improve your abilities, but also in many cases, that of the individuals and units under your command.So, how does one give orders to human individuals online?

Some (including the sources themselves) will have trouble with the book&#x2019;s use of quotes (or lack thereof). The interviews, according to the authors, were conducted &#x201C;on deep background,&#x201D; and dialogue was &#x201C;reconstructed extensively&#x201D; and with &#x201C;extreme care.&#x201D; Sometimes the source of a quote is clear, as when the book gets inside someone&#x2019;s head, but not always. Many of the book&#x2019;s events were covered heavily at the time (Hillary&#x2019;s presumed juggernaut; Michelle Obama&#x2019;s initial hostility to her husband&#x2019;s candidacy), but some of what this volume delivers is totally behind-the-scenes and genuinely jaw-dropping, including the revelation that senators ostensibly for Clinton (New York&#x2019;s Chuck Schumer) pushed hard for Obama. Another? The McCain camp found Sarah Palin by doing computer searches of female Republican officeholders.

SitcomSkip and Scooterco-stars Georgie York, who like her character exudes spunky charm, and Bram Shepard, whose upbringing couldn't be more different from the nice boy he plays, hate each other even before Bram's offscreen sexual escapades lead to the sitcom's cancellation. Flash forward eight years: his career has cratered, and her biggest accomplishment has been briefly marrying hunky star Lance Marks, who abandons her for sex-goddess-turned-international-do-gooder Jade Gentry. So when Bram and Georgie wake up from a Vegas bender and find themselves married to each other, they make the most of it: Georgie aims to undo the damage Lance has done to her heart and her public image, while Bram is gunning for a second chance at life, love and stardom. It's a blast to watch the hate-each-other-yet-made-for-each-other couple as they duck paparazzi or spar before falling into bed.

        "B00004U5VF": "The Tekken series has always stood as a set of console games that went above and beyond their arcade counterparts.  From additional characters to completely new modes, the series has always tried to add something that the arcade games lacked.  Tekken Tag Tournament, at first glance, is the most dramatic upgrade over an arcade Tekken game to date. The graphics have been given a huge boost, similar to the upgrade that Namco's weapon-based fighter, Soul Calibur, received when it hit the Dreamcast last year. Plus, new modes have been added. But does the series capture the same magical feeling that made the previous Tekken games such smash hits? Most definitely.Tekken Tag Tournament serves as an upgrade to Tekken 3, adding a few new moves along the way. Fighters that had appeared in Tekken 2 but were missing from Tekken 3 have been brought back as well, and most of them have lots of new moves to help balance them with the more powerful Tekken 3 fighters. Finally, the game is now fought in the same tag-team style as Capcom's versus series of fighters, so you can switch between two different characters at any time. Much like Street Fighter EX3 and Dead or Alive 2, you can have up to four players, with each player controlling a different fighter in the tag battle. However, unlike most other tag-battle fighters, Tekken Tag rounds end after only one of the two fighters have been defeated, rather than letting the battle continue as a one-on-two affair. An option that let you configure this would have been nice. Aside from the standard tag-battle arcade mode, there is also a one-on-one game that makes Tekken Tag Tournament more like the previous Tekken games, as well as the standard team battle (though it is now a tag-team battle), time attack, and survival modes. Unlockable modes include a theater mode, where you can watch all of the game's endings; a gallery mode, which lets you pause the game at any time and snap a screenshot of the action that is saved to your memory card for later viewing; and Tekken bowl mode, a bowling minigame that lets you hit the lanes and toss glimmer globes at Heihachi-headed bowling pins. Each character has a different bowling style that affects speed and control. The character endings, with the exception of the game's final boss, are rendered using the game engine. This presumably saved time during the game's development. As a result, they're short, mostly meaningless, and decidedly less than impressive.  By comparison, the prerendered intro and the final boss' prerendered ending are simply incredible pieces of footage. In Japan, the TV commercial for the game is simply an abridged version of the game's new intro movie. Very striking stuff.Graphically, the game has taken a very large leap, and the arcade version of the game looks downright ugly by comparison.  The characters are very, very smooth, and the backgrounds are amazing and filled with lots of movement, from helicopters to crowds of spectators. Some stages are well lit, showing off some really excellent lens-flare techniques. There are also some nice little touches, such as grass being crushed down by falling fighters then slowly springing up afterward. However, the game suffers from one particular problem that has in fact been seen throughout the series, but with the power of the PlayStation2 behind it, you'd expect it to be a thing of the past. The problem is the same one that showed up in Street Fighter EX3. While the backdrops of the fights and the ground on which you fight look great separately, they don't mesh very well. The result is two different types of scrolling, making it look as if the battle is occurring on a small, circular spinning platform surrounded by a nearly stationary background. It's easy to miss while you're actually playing, but it sticks out like a sore thumb on watching the game closely. Also, the game uses much of the same animation and motion-capture data from Tekken 3. Sure, the characters look pretty incredible, but with the identical animation quality, even as good as that animation was, the game looks and feels a little on the stale side. The soundtrack is full of techno and vocoder robot voices that will either endear you to the soundtrack or drive you up the wall.How much you enjoy the game will directly relate to one factor: If you played so much Tekken 2 and 3 that you couldn't possibly play another match, Tekken Tag doesn't offer enough new features to draw you back in. But if you've stayed away from the Tekken series for a long time, Tekken Tag is a very warm homecoming, delivering the same solid gameplay that Tekken fans crave in large doses. Still, you won't be able to stop yourself from wondering what Namco could have done with the game if it had been designed on the PS2 (or comparable arcade hardware) from the start. Guess we'll all have to wait for Tekken 4 to find that out.--Jeff Gerstmann--Copyright &#169; 2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

When the sisters&#xFFFD; mother dies after a long illness, the siblings find a hidden passageway to an enchanted pavilion under the castle where they can dance all night, secretly breaking the rules of mourning. The mysterious and alluring Keeper makes this possible, but he also seems to have less-than-honorable plans for the girls, especially Azalea. The tale&#xFFFD;s atmosphere becomes increasingly dark and brooding as the truth from ages past comes out, and Azalea realizes just what evil they are pitted against. With several unexpected twists, the story, based on the original Grimms&#xFFFD; tale &#xFFFD;The Worn-Out Dancing Shoes,&#xFFFD; plunges toward a harrowing conclusion. This first novel is richly imagined with a gothic feel, and Dixon&#xFFFD;s descriptions of the many dances are thrilling. Although the general story line will be familiar to readers of Jessica Day George&#xFFFD;s Princess of the Midnight Ball (2009), this romantic fantasy is darker in tone, and the villain resembles the faeries in Nancy Werlin&#xFFFD;s Impossible (2008) and O. R. Melling&#xFFFD;s The Hunter&#xFFFD;s Moon (2005). The story gracefully explores significant themes of grief and loss, mercy and love.

        "0061243582": "Equal parts droll and gorgeous nostalgia book and heartfelt plea for a renewed sense of adventure in the lives of boys and men, Conn and Hal Iggulden'sThe Dangerous Book for Boysbecame a mammoth bestseller in the United Kingdom in 2006. Adapted, in moderation, for American customs in this edition (cricket is gone, rugby remains; conkers are out, Navajo Code Talkers in),The Dangerous Bookis a guide book for dads as well as their sons, as a reminder of lore and technique that have not yet been completely lost to the digital age. Recall the adventures of Scott of the Antarctic and the Battle of the Somme, relearn how to palm a coin, tan a skin, and, most charmingly, wrap a package in brown paper and string. The book's ambitions are both modest and winningly optimistic: you get the sense that by learning how to place a splint or write in invisible ink, a boy might be prepared for anything, even girls (which warrant a small but wise chapter of their own).InsideThe Dangerous Book for BoysFigure 8 KnotSheet Bend KnotThe Battle of WaterlooQuestions for Conn IgguldenConn and Hal Iggulden are two brothers who have not forgotten what it was like to be boys. Conn taught for many years before becoming one of the most admired and popular young historical novelists with his Emperor series, based on the life of Julius Caesar, and his newly embarked series on Genghis Khan, while Hal is a theater director. We asked Conn about their collaboration.Amazon.com:It's difficult to describe what a phenomenonThe Dangerous Book for Boyswas in the UK last year. When I would check the bestseller list on our sister site, Amazon.co.uk, there would be, along with your book, which spent much of the year at the top of the list, a half-dozen apparent knockoff books of similar boy knowledge. Clearly, you tapped into something big. What do you think it was?Iggulden:In a word, fathers. I am one myself and I think we've become aware that the whole \"health and safety\" overprotective culture isn't doing our sons any favors. Boys need to learn about risk. They need to fall off things occasionally, or--and this is the important bit--they'll take worse risks on their own. If we do away with challenging playgrounds and cancel school trips for fear of being sued, we don't end up with safer boys--we end up with them walking on train tracks. In the long run, it's not safe at all to keep our boys in the house with a Playstation. It's not good for their health or their safety.You only have to push a boy on a swing to see how much enjoys the thrill of danger. It's hard-wired. Remove any opportunity to test his courage and they'll find ways to test themselves that will be seriously dangerous for everyone around them. I think of it like playing the lottery--someone has to say \"Look, youwon'twin--and your childrenwon'tbe hurt. Relax. Itwon'tbe you.\"I think that's the core of the book's success. It isn't just a collection of things to do. The heroic stories alone are something we haven't had for too long. It isn't about climbing Everest, but it is an attitude, a philosophy for fathers and sons. Our institutions are too wrapped up in terror over being sued--so we have to do things with them ourselves. This book isn't a bad place to start.As for knockoff books--great. They'll give my son something to read that doesn't involve him learning a dull moral lesson of some kind--just enjoying an adventure or learning skills and crafts so that he has a feeling of competence and confidence--just as we have.Amazon.com:You made some changes for the U.S. edition, and I for one am sorry that you have removed the section on conkers, if only because it's such a lovely and mysterious word. What are (or what is) conkers?Iggulden:Horse chestnuts strung on a shoelace and knocked against one another until they shatter. In the entire history of the world, no one has ever been hurt by a conker, but it's still been banned by some British schools,just in case. Another school banned paper airplanes. Honestly, it's enough to make you weep, if I did that sort of thing, which I try not to. Reading Jane Austen is still allowed, however.Amazon.com:What knowledge did you decide was important to add for American boys? I notice in both editions you have an excellent and useful section on table football, as played with coins. Is paper football strictly an American pastime? I'm not sure I could have gotten through the fourth grade without it.Iggulden:I like knowing the details of battles, so Gettysburg and the Alamo had to go in, along with the Gettysburg address, stickball, state capitals, U.S. mountains, American trees, insects, U.S. historical timelines, and a lot of others. Navajo code talkers of WWII is a great chapter. It probably helps that I am a huge fan of America. It was only while rewriting for the U.S. that I realized how many positive references there already are. You have NASA and NASA trumps almost anything.As for paper football, ever since I thought of putting the book together, people keep saying things like \"You have rockets in there, yes? Everyone loves rockets!\" Paper football is the first American one, but there will be many others. No book in the world is long enough to put them all in--unless we do a sequel, of course.Amazon.com:Do you thinkThe Dangerous Book for Boysis being read by actual boys, or only by nostalgic adults? Have you seen boys getting up from their Xboxes to go outside and perform first aid or tan animal skins or build go-carts?Iggulden:I've had a lot of emails and letters from boys who loved the book--as well as fathers. I've had responses from kids as young as ten and an old man of 87, who pointed out a problem with the shadow stick that we've since changed. The thing to remember is that we may be older and more cynical every year, but boys simply aren't. If they are given the chance to make a go-cart with their dad, they jump at it. Mine did. Nothing gives me more pleasure than to know the book is being used with fathers and sons together, trying things out. Nothing is more valuable to a boy than time with his dad, learning something fun--or something difficult. That's part of the attitude too. If it's hard, you don't make it easy, you grab it by the throat and hang on for as long as it takes.The book is often bought by fathers, of course. Their sons don't know Scott of the Antarctic is a great adventure story. How could they if it isn't taught any more? Good, heroic stories don't appear much in modern school curriculums--and then we wonder why boys don't seem interested.Amazon.com:And finally, on to the important questions: Should Pluto still be a planet? And what was the best dinosaur?Iggulden:Pluto is a planet. I know there are scientists who say it isn't, but it's big enough to be round and it has a moon, for crying out loud. Of course it's a planet. Give it ten years and they'll be agreeing with me again.As for the best dinosaur, it depends what you mean by best. For sheer perfection, it probably has to be the shark and the crocodile. Modern ones are smaller but their record for sheer survival is pretty impressive. I only hope humanity can do as well. The only thing that will stop us is worrying too much.",

Sure, he's the oft-proclaimed, hard-boiled heir to Hammett and Chandler, but Lehane also takes a page from the Hemingway school of hyper-intense writing. He pares away and pares away until he's left with the absolute essentials--and then those essentials just explode off the page.In his five Kenzie-Gennaro novels, the detective duo is at the nexus of Lehane's  big bang.

It's  impossible to imagine these streets without the pair, or to imagine the pair  away from those streets.Mystic River, then, arrives as a bit of a  gamble, as Lehane moves from the sharp edges of portraiture to the broader  strokes of landscape. No Angie, no Patrick: this neighborhood is on its own.  It's not any prettier and certainly no friendlier, and its working-class  fa&ccedil;ade still barely masks the irresistible tug of violent ways, means,  and ends.Twenty-five years ago, Dave Boyle got into a car. When he came back four days  later, he was different in a way that destroyed his friendship with Sean Devine  and Jimmy Marcus. Now Sean's a cop, Jimmy's a store owner with a prison record  and mob connections, and Dave's trying hard to keep his demons safely submerged.  When Jimmy's daughter Katie is found murdered, each of the men must confront a  past that none is eager to acknowledge. Lehane tugs delicately on the strands  that weave this neighborhood together, testing for their strengths and  weaknesses; this novel seems as much anthropological case study as thriller.By turns violent and pensive,Mystic Riveris vintage Lehane. How good is  it? You may go in missing Angie and Patrick, but after a few pages you won't  even realize they're gone. Lehane's noir is still black magic.--Kelly  Flynn--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

Stuggling to remember whom Katie is marrying (and indeed that there is to be a marriage at all), Marina does remember her youth as a Hermitage Museum docent as the siege of Leningrad began; it is into these memories that she disappears. After frantic packing, the Hermitage's collection is transported to a safe hiding place until the end of the war. The museum staff and their families remain, wintering (all 2,000 of them) in the Hermitage basement to avoid bombs and marauding soldiers. Marina, using the technique of a fellow docent, memorizes favorite Hermitage works; these memories, beautifully interspersed, are especially vibrant. Dean, making her debut, weaves Marina's past and present together effortlessly. The dialogue around Marina's forgetfulness is extremely well done, and the Hermitage material has depth. Although none of the characters emerges particularly vividly (Marina included), memory, the hopes one pins on it and the letting go one must do around it all take on real poignancy, giving the story a satisfying fullness.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But after three years spent at a frenetic pace, Sankovitch decided to slow down and rediscover the pleasure of books in order to reconnect with the memory of her sister. Despite the day-to-day responsibilities of raising four sons&mdash;and the holidays, vacations, and sudden illnesses that accompany a large family&mdash;Sankovitch vowed to read one book a day for an entire year and blog about it. In this entertaining bibliophile's dream, Sankovitch (who launched ReadAllDay.org and was profiled in the New York Times) found that her \"year of magical reading\" was \"not a way to rid myself of sorrow but a way to absorb it.\" As well as being an homage to her sister and their family of readers, Sankovitch's memoir speaks to the power that books can have over our daily lives. Sankovitch champions the act of reading not as an indulgence but as a necessity, and will make the perfect gift from one bookworm to another. (June)(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.  All rights reserved.",

        "B0000696CZ": "How big is this game? Even publicists forother gamesend up talking aboutVice Citywhen they call our office, babbling in the same helplessly intoxicated way that afflicts everyone who plays it. The achievement ofVice City(which, as everyone knows by now, is set in the 1980s and offers an all-new,Miami Vice-inspired story) is not only that it manages to live up to an absurd level of expectation, but that it takes the game places that fans of its predecessorGrand Theft Auto 3never dreamed of, and that it achieves this astonishing level of innovation without losing anything that madeGTA3the bestselling PS2 game of all time.After a brilliant homage to the era of the Commodore 64 in the opening credits, the first thing you'll notice is the improved graphics, which are smoother and more detailed, and--with effects like neon lights reflected on rain-slick streets, and intense Florida sunlight--have a lush, tropical look that immediately gives you a strong sense of place. The architecture is more fabulous by tenfold, with art deco buildings, high-rise hotels, and believably seedy back alleys. The control scheme is essentially the same as inGTA3, but the cars handle much better, and in pedestrian mode there is a new crouch move. You will have access to fast, great-handling cars right away, as opposed toGTA3which made you unlock the second island before you could get your hands on any respectable wheels. This game has such riches to offer that there is no need to be chintzy with the vehicles.Cops are more vigilant this time--minor offenses like whacking innocent bystanders will more often than not get you a two-star wanted level--and are harder to elude (though they still can't seem to climb stairs or negotiate sharp turns). So while free-roaming exploration is as fun as ever, there is more incentive to perform the missions instead of randomly raising hell. Not that that's a bad thing: even lazy criminals like myself (inGTA3, I would rather toss hand grenades into traffic than follow orders from some rude Mafia boss) will be quickly caught up in the vivid characters and hilarious, fascinating story, in which you play an acid-washed-jeans-wearing thug named Tommy Vercetti. Where inGTA3missions were blocky, schematic affairs only nominally connected to the story, this time tasks move the story briskly along and deftly blend cinematics and game action. For example, there is a scene of a character throwing Tommy a gun, at which point you are suddenly thrown back into the action and must make an instant decision about whom to trust and what to do.There are more, and more detailed, indoor environments, including a hotel, police station, and mall (a slight downside to this is that some of the more elaborate indoor environments require load times). The layout of the city, with tons of backyards, narrow alleys, and fire escapes, encourages creativity when eluding pursuit, as does greater access to rooftops. Get your motorcycle up the fire escape and a whole new world of action is possible, including... well, use your imagination.This overview barely scratches the surface of theVice Cityexperience, its colorful explosion of music, clothes, combat, and brilliant voice acting, not to mention the plot twist midway through the game that changes the very nature of the game itself. Though it was the outrageous, amoral violence that got all the press, the essential genius ofGTA3was its intoxicating blend of script and open-ended action.

What she finds is far from pretty, revealing parallels to her own awful past. There are others, none without tragedy. But their morbid, often unrepentantly violent stories are balanced with moments of emotional escape--poetic beauty from outside the prison and strange explanations from within. These magical aspects, or \"enchanted things,\" are the sensational imaginings of an unhinged, unnamed inmate--York's prison neighbor and our narrator.

        "0061988243": "[Signature]Reviewed byMarlon JamesOf the many pitfalls lurking for the historical novel, the most dangerous is history itself. The best writers either warp it for selfish purposes (Gore Vidal), dig for the untold, interior history (Toni Morrison), or both (Jeannette Winterson). Allende, four years afterInes of My Soul, returns with another historical novel, one that soaks up so much past life that there is nowhere left to go but where countless have been. Opening in Saint Domingue a few years before the Haitian revolution would tear it apart, the story has at its center Zarit&eacute;, a mulatto whose extraordinary life takes her from that blood-soaked island to dangerous and freewheeling New Orleans; from rural slave life to urban Creole life and a different kind of cruelty and adventure. Yet even in the new city, Zarit&eacute; can't quite free herself from the island, and the people alive and dead that have followed her.Zarit&eacute;'s passages are striking. More than merely lyrical, they map around rhythms and spirits, making her as much conduit as storyteller. One wishes there was more of her because, unlike Allende, Zarit&eacute; is under no mission to show us how much she knows. Every instance, a brush with a faith healer, for example, is an opportunity for Allende to showcase what she has learned about voodoo, medicine, European and Caribbean history, Napoleon, the Jamaican slave Boukman, and the legendary Mackandal, a runaway slave and master of black magic who has appeared in several novels including Alejo Carpentier'sKingdom of This World. The effect of such display of research is a novel that is as inert as a history textbook, much like, oddly enough John Updike'sTerrorist, a novel that revealed an author who studied a voluminous amount of facts without learning a single truth.Slavery as a subject in fiction is still a high-wire act, but one expects more from Allende. Too often she forgoes the restraint and empathy essential for such a topic and plunges into a heavy breathing prose reminiscent of the Falconhurst novels of the 1970s, but without the guilty pleasure of sexual taboo. Sex, overwritten and undercooked, is where opulent hips slithered like a knowing snake until she impaled herself upon his rock-hard member with a deep sigh of joy. Even the references to African spirituality seem skin-deep and perfunctory, revealing yet another writer too entranced by the myth of black cultural primitivism to see the brainpower behind it. WithInes of My Soulone had the sense that the author was trying to structure a story around facts, dates, incidents, and real people. Here it is the reverse, resulting in a book one second-guesses at every turn. Of course there will be a forbidden love. Betrayal. Incest. Heartbreak. Insanity. Violence. And in the end the island in the novel's title remains legend. Fittingly so, because to reach theIsland Beneath the Sea, one would have had to dive deep.

But his girlfriend Caitlin deserved it--hadn't she defied him by singing in the school talent show when he had forbidden her to display herself like that? Even though he'd told her that everybody would laugh at her because she couldn't sing and was a fat slob? Both were lies. Because Caitlin was so beautiful, the only person who understood him. Out of his desperate need for her came all the mean words and the hitting. But now Caitlin's family has procured a restraining order to keep Nick away, and the judge has sentenced him to Mario Ortega's Family Violence class, to sit around every week with six other angry guys who hit their girlfriends. And to write a journal explaining how he got into this mess.Other teen novels--most strikinglyDreamlandby Sarah Dessen--have shown dating violence from the point of view of a young girl trapped in an abusive relationship, but inBreathing Underwater, first-time novelist Alex Flinn tackles the difficult task of making us understand, if not sympathize with, the motivation of a violent young man. The story, like Rob Thomas's stylistically similarRats Saw God, proceeds in two different time frames: the journal in which Nick relives the course of his tender but stormy love affair with Caitlin and the time after the restraining order, in which a desperate and friendless Nick struggles to understand and overcome his anger.

In between, he recounts such wonders as an entire town struck  with insomnia, a woman who ascends to heaven while hanging laundry, and a suicide that defies the laws of physics:A trickle of blood came out under the door, crossed the living room,  went out into the street, continued on in a straight line across the uneven terraces, went down steps and climbed over curbs, passed along the  Street of the Turks, turned a corner to the right and another to the left,  made a right angle at the Buend&iacute;a house, went in under the closed door,  crossed through the parlor, hugging the walls so as not to stain the rugs, went  on to the other living room, made a wide curve to avoid the dining-room  table, went along the porch with the begonias, and passed without being seen  under Amaranta's chair as she gave an arithmetic lesson to Aureliano  Jos&eacute;, and went through the pantry and came out in the kitchen, where  &Uacute;rsula was getting ready to crack thirty-six eggs to make bread.\"Holy Mother of God!\" &Uacute;rsula shouted.The story follows 100 years in the life of Macondo, a village founded  by Jos&eacute; Arcadio Buend&iacute;a and occupied by descendants all  sporting variations on their progenitor's name: his sons, Jos&eacute; Arcadio and Aureliano,  and grandsons, Aureliano Jos&eacute;, Aureliano Segundo, and Jos&eacute;  Arcadio Segundo. Then there are the women--the two &Uacute;rsulas, a handful of  Remedios, Fernanda, and Pilar--who struggle to remain grounded even as their menfolk build castles in the air.  If it is possible for a novel to be highly comic  and deeply tragic at the same time, thenOne Hundred Years of  Solitudedoes the trick. Civil war rages throughout, hearts break, dreams  shatter, and lives are lost, yet the effect is literary pentimento, with  sorrow's outlines bleeding through the vibrant colors of Garc&#xED;a M&aacute;rquez's  magical realism. Consider, for example, the ghost of Prudencio Aguilar, whom  Jos&eacute; Arcadio Buend&iacute;a has killed in a fight. So lonely is the man's  shade that it haunts Buend&iacute;a's house, searching anxiously for water with which  to clean its wound.

The outcome is good, not perfect (in accordance with one of her \"Secrets of Adulthood\": \"Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good\"), but Rubin's funny, perceptive account is both inspirational and forgiving, and sprinkled with just enough wise tips, concrete advice and timely research (including all those other recent books on happiness) to qualify as self-help. Defying self-help expectations, however, Rubin writes with keen senses of self and narrative, balancing the personal and the universal with a light touch.

        "B000FQBPCQ": "When an evil darkness enshrouds the land of Hyrule, a young farm boy named Link must awaken the hero and the animal within. When Link travels to the Twilight Realm, he transforms into a wolf and must scour the land with the help of a mysterious girl named Midna. Besides his trusty sword and shield, Link will use his bow and arrows by aiming with the Wii Remote controller, fight while on horseback and use a wealth of other items, both new and old.The most epic Zelda ever launches with the Wii.Link roams an entirely new land of Hyrule.View larger.Take control of your trusty horse as you travel from quest to quest.View larger.Link must solve a number of challenging puzzles to progress to boss battles.View larger.Fishing with the Wii Remote is a fun and worthwhile diversion.View larger.Link's journeys, reinventedHailed by many as the best Zelda game since 1998'sOcarina of Time,Twilight Princessthrusts players into a troubled world ravaged by a dangerous magic. Sporting a new, more realistic visual style than the previous Zelda title, Link looks much more like an adult than in previous installments and fits well into an environment that provides Zelda fans with a much more gritty and grim environment to explore. The entirety of the quest fits this darker mood, as both Link and NPC's alike share the same concern for the changes about in Hyrule.More than just a spiritual successor to previous Zelda installments,Twilight Princessoffers players a new way of controlling Link through dungeons, forests, towns, and the bizarre Twilight Realm: precise weapon controls with the Wii remote! Players can use the remote to control Links' weapons including the sword, arrows, and boomerang. This new control scheme allows for much faster and more accurate control than on previous Nintendo hardware. For example, waving the remote in the air will result in Link performing the same move with the sword. To fire off on arrow, players \"pull back\" on a virtual controller string as the Wii remote's speaker lets players know that the projectile is ready for release. It all works incredibly well and adds to the title's immersion and style- you feel more in the center of the action than in previous Zelda games.As impressive as the new control scheme is, the scope and size of the new land of the Hyrule is equally as impressive- truly the Wii's first epic adventure. Beautifully crafted and four years in the making, the land players travel through is vast and diverse as the dungeons and monsters that lie within. As players collect triforce pieces from the distant sections of the continent, they will get to know many different villages and foes. Thankfully, Link will be able to move over long stretches of land faster thanks to \"Epona,\" your faithful horse. Epona also helps Link become a more effective fighter, as a number of powerful and impressive sword strikes can be launched while galloping through fields of enemies.The Twilight Realm awaitsLike most games in the Zelda franchise, Link begins his adventure with little more than the clothes he has on an an inkling that something has gone awry. After an initial trip to the Twilight Realm, in which Link appears as a wolf, a friendly shadow dweller named Midna will meet up with players and give helpful advice on gameplay. Fortunately for players, this virtual assistant spells out ways to be a more effective adventurer in and out of the shadow world. Early stages of the game have Link spending a lot of time in the Twilight Realm, and outdoor areas of Hyrule, attempting to clear areas of the strange darkness that has seemingly fallen over every village, forest, and field. As the story progresses, players will learn the cause of the shadows, and what they must to do vanquish them for good.Puzzling puzzlesLink once again finds himself in a number of classic Zelda-esque puzzle scenarios in which he must light torches to unlock doors, raise and lower water levels, and fight enemies to collect keys and open chests for valuable rupees. A number of the dungeons present unique puzzle challenges that rely on the player's ability to hone their Wii remote's control, such as an air castle in the sky that can only be accessed by an extremely accurate grappling hook toss.In general,Twilight Princessis more challenging than the average Zelda game, with a number of boss battles having protracted hit sequences with little support potions about, and even less warning. Still, there's never been an adventure experience such as this, wherein players can literally charge at a dungeon boss with their fists and punch the air to defeat an enormous foe. As the finest Zelda experience in almost ten years and the game fans have been waiting for,Twilight Princesswill delight young and old gamers alike.",

        "B0000A9Y11": "Many decried the original Game Boy Advance's reflective LCD screen and its reliance on external light sources. The Game Boy Advance SP's main feature--optional backlighting--fixes this complaint nicely, but it's the wealth of other features that makes this system so surprisingly good.At first look, you might think the SP is a sleek travel alarm clock. When closed, it's just as tall and deep as the original GBA, but only half as wide. Due to its clamshell design, the screen is always protected from everyday scratches. A small button in the center of the console turns on the backlighting element for use in low-light situations, like in a moving car.The SP comes with a well-designed power adapter that recharges a built-in battery; its prongs fold in for easier storage. Our informal tests found that it takes about four hours to fully charge (you can even play it while it's plugged in and charging), and the battery lasts about 11 hours with the backlighting constantly on--your results may vary. Using the backlighting less often will conserve battery power.Withseparately sold  cables, you can connect the Game Boy Advance SP to other GBAs  for multiplayer gaming (above) or to theNintendo GameCube(below) to access secret levels, exchange data, or use other special  features that vary from game to game.The quality of the backlighting is very good. It's bright and clear when looking directly at it, but degraded from other angles. This is only a problem for friends who are watching the screen from over your shoulder.But size, power, and affordability do not come without trade offs. There's no headphone jack here, though Nintendo promises an adapter. The system isn't very loud at its highest volume, and the sound can be turned down to socially acceptable levels. The L and R shoulder buttons are a fraction of the size they were on the GBA, and thus are harder to hit. Also, the reduced size of the SP is slightly less comfortable for adult hands than the GBA, but perhaps more comfortable for smaller hands. The cartridge port placement on the lower part of the console is fine for GBA games, since they are flush with the console body, but older Game Boy Color carts will stick out in a way that takes some getting used to.Open it up and the hinge will seek out a preferred, pre-set angle (about 150 degrees), though you can open it a bit wider or narrower for your own comfort. The hinge stands up well to lateral pressure, and over all, the SP seems just as rugged as its predecessor--which has proven to be very rugged, indeed.--Porter B.

Out of options, she reluctantly accepts her father's offer to help refurbish Birdsong, the old family place he recently inherited in Guthrie, Georgia. All it will take, he tells her, is a little paint and some TLC to turn the fading Victorian mansion into a real-estate cash cow.But, oh, is Dempsey in for a surprise when she arrives in Guthrie. \"Bird Droppings\" would more aptly describe the moldering Pepto Bismol-pink dump with duct-taped windows and a driveway full of junk. There's also a murderously grumpy old lady, one of Dempsey's distant relations, who has claimed squatter's rights and isn't moving out. Ever.Furthermore, everyone in Guthrie seems to know Dempsey's business, from a smooth-talking real-estate agent to a cute lawyer who owns the local newspaper. It wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the pesky FBI agents who show up on Dempsey's doorstep, hoping to pry information about her ex-boss from her.All Dempsey can do is roll up her sleeves and get to work.

Nothing says &#x201C;new and cheap&#x201D; faster than a flimsy hollow-core  door and bright gold repro brass hardware. Look for solid wood doors and wood frame windows at salvage yards and antique  markets. And don&#x2019;t forget to check the &#x201C;building materials&#x201D; category on Craigslist. I got all the doors for my beach  house off Craigslist--for $5 apiece. Vintage hardware can frequently be found at flea markets, or check online sources  like eBay.Vintage light fixtures give a great look--but be sure you factor in the cost of re-wiring them, and finding  good-looking shades. Nothing gives a lamp that &#x201C;granny&#x201D; look faster than a dingy yellow shade.Before you invest in antique cast-iron claw-foot tubs or sinks, make sure they have proper fittings. Measure drains  and faucet spreads and make sure you can find new ones that will fit and function properly. Antique toilets are  generally a bad idea--most local codes require low-flow toilets for water conservation.Before re-wiring a house, put together a furniture floor plan. You don&#x2019;t want a heat register under the living room  sofa, but you will want outlets on either side of the bed for reading lamps, and for any area that might be used as an  office you&#x2019;ll want plenty of grounded plugs. And how about that flat-screen television your husband wants? Plan now for  cable locations.Be flexible. A great fireplace surround could become a headboard, as could an old paneled door--turned sideways.  And that leaded glass window that had to be removed in the remodel? Why not fit it with mirrors and a hinge and make it  into a bathroom medicine cabinet?Top Five Best Junking FindsPair of barrel-back armchairs--$30 at an estate sale.

Stylistically, it resembles a Holly Hobbie Colorforms set. All the characters are of childlike proportions, and the village's Tudor buildings seem pried from a Yorkshire hamlet.

Though this is not a kid's game (it carries a Teen ESRB rating), gamers who are put off by kitschy/cute nuances should beware--this game is loaded with them.But at its heart,Dark Cloud 2is a wonderfully solid RPG. Its story has three main elements: Max's lost mother, the secret of what's going on outside the village, and why the evil clown wants Max's red stone pendant. Fighting takes place in real time, unlike the turn-based fighting in the similarFinal Fantasyseries. This was a good decision on behalf of the designers, as was the attention to weapon customizing. And if you love to manage inventory (there aren't many RPG fans that don't), this is your game.

Collins is a bit breathlessly enthusiastic, but clear and interesting; Porras, unfortunately, is poorly inflected and wooden. They set out to determine what's special about \"visionary\" companies--the Disneys, Wal-Marts, and Mercks, companies at the very top of their game that have demonstrated longevity and great brand image. The authors compare 18 \"visionary\" picks to a control group of \"successful-but-second-rank\" companies. Thus Disney is compared to Columbia Pictures, Ford to GM, and so on.A central myth, according to the authors, is that visionary companies start with a great product and are pushed into the future by charismatic leaders.

If you thoughtLuigi's Mansionwas  frightening, then quite frankly you've led a sheltered life.Eternal  Darkness: Sanity's Requiem, however, is the real deal: it's scary, it's  gory, and it's really nothing likeResident Evilat all.The game starts when you find out your grandfather has had his clogs popped by  some unspeakable monster.

The most dramatic  reversal, he says, may have occurred in the sciences: \"Those who had been  disciples now became teachers; those who had been masters became pupils, often  reluctant and resentful pupils.\" Today's Arab governments have blamed their  plight on any number of external culprits, from Western imperialism to the Jews.  Lewis believes they must instead commit to putting their own houses in order:  \"If the peoples of Middle East continue on their present path, the suicide  bomber may become a metaphor for the whole region, and there will be no escape  from a downward spiral of hate and spite, rage and self-pity, [and] poverty and  oppression.\" Anybody who wants to understand the historical backdrop to  September 11 would do well to look for it on these pages.--John Miller--This text refers to theHardcoveredition.",
        "B000RZPW9W": "Based on the events and characters of Robert E. Howard'sConan the Cimmerianstories,Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventuresis a fantasy themed massively-multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) that immerses players in a dark, expansive universe filled with ground-breaking brutal combat, dangerously intoxicating magical abilities, and the social and cooperative game features that MMORPG players crave.The MMORPG finally maturesA troubled King Conan on his throne.View larger.Test your metal in close combat.View larger.Straddle War Mammoths &amp; Killer Rhinos.View larger.Lead your guild in player vs. player battles.View larger.Explore the pleasures &amp; pitfalls of the Hyborian Age.View larger.Set in the later years of Conan?s life, after he has famously become king by his own hand, the game centers around the fragile state of Conan?s rule in Aquilonia. Surrounded by enemies and hostile nations, Conan?s rule hangs by a thread and in the end, it?s up to players, either singly or backed by their guilds to turn the tide for or against the embattled king.Massively Multiplayer Gaming for the Adult PlayerOne of the most highly anticipated MMORPGs in recent years due to the strength and familiarity of theConanfranchise across a variety of major media,Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventuresis the first of several releases planned for the franchise, all of which are aimed at an adult audience. Firmly rooted in the savage, bloody, violent and sexy Hyborian universe, players can expect a graphically beautiful game blended with gritty gameplay that is true to both the barbarian hero from Howard?s writings and the Schwarzenegger influenced version from books, movies and comics.Available Cultures and ClassesAlthoughAge of Conancontains a wide range of peoples, its playable cultures are currently limited to Aquilonians, Cimmerians, and Stygians. Within each of these players can choose from a selection of archetypal character classes, although available classes and subsequent subclasses are not necessarily the same within each culture. For example, archetypal classes for Aquilonians and Cimmerians are Rogue, Priest and Soldier, while Stygians are represented by Rogue, Priest and Mage. Further differences exist within subclasses for each. See the basic breakdown of all three cultures below:Aquilonians: Internally divided, but united against their barbarian neighbors, the Aquilonians live lives on the edge. Their kingdom, with its prosperous cities, enlightened culture and religious freedom, is known as the \"Flower of the West.\" Yet for all this and despite the power of King, Conan I, it is a land where culture clashes and unrest are always a threat.Cimmerians: As the Hyborian Age comes to an end the northern barbarian clans of the Cimmerians know that the end of their time is drawing near too. King Conan I of Aquilonia is himself a Cimmerian, though not typical of his people. Although his life has been filled with wanderlust, his Kin care nothing for what occurs outside their clan territories.Stygians: Masters of the magical arts and ruled by their consuming worship of the serpent-god Set, the Stygians excel at occult and diabolic lore. They learned long ago that true power lies in knowledge and in pacts with dark powers. This single-mindedness has allowed them become the only culture to harness the secrets of the Mage class and power that comes with it.Modes Singleplayer as well as MultiplayerUnlike most MMORPGs,Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventuresincludes a significant singleplayer experience as well as deep overarching multiplayer gameplay. This is an atypical MMORPG feature, but one that has a purpose. Players enter the game as a lowly galley slave with no memory of his/her past, and over the first five to 20 levels of singleplayer action build the skills necessary to survive in the game's multiplayer levels. During this time you will traverse a variety of rich environments including jungles, deserts, mountains, valleys, dungeons and cities packed with NPCs, beasts and monsters, before eventually leveling up and moving back to your chosen culture?s homeland. Because the only character-related choices that players have to make at the game?s opening are their looks, clothing and culture, this singleplayer mode is important in deciding what class and subclass to pursue and thus the level of impact your character will have in greater multiplayer portions of the game.In-game levels 20 and above are strictly multiplayer. 20-40 introduce players to guilds. 40-60 deal with large scale combat. 60-80 have the player interacting with King Conan and levels 80 and up represent end-game play. Here gameplay changes as social aspects of MMORPG gameplay take over on a large scale.Real-time Combat That Takes Queues from the FPSTraditionally MMORPGs have utilized a mix of auto and turn-based functionality in their combat systems, butAge of Conandispenses with that, instead drawing inspiration from FPS/action games. Firmly rooted in the brutality of theHyborianuniverse, game developer Funcom has devised an action-based system that not only provides the sense of actually being in the fight, but also requires the player to participate in it. That means no simple targeted attacks. Players can attack and defend from nearly any position in real-time, whether on the ground or atop a mount, while standing still or on the move. It?s a recipe for carnage and one that fits right into the world of Conan.The combat system inAge of Conancomes in three forms: drunken brawling, mini games like CTF and massive Player vs. Player battles, which lets you engage in siege combat to defend or attack a city. All are easy to learn, but difficult to master, providing hours worth of play and replay value and are the core of this new cutting edge MMORPG.System Requirements:Minimum Specifications:Recommended Specifications:OS:Windows XP Service Pack 2 or Windows VistaProcessor:Intel Pentium 4 3Ghz or equivalentIntel Core 2 Duo 2.4GHz or equivalentRAM:1GB2048MB Dual Channel DDR2Video Card:NVIDIA GeForce 6600 or betterNVIDIA GeForce 7900 GTX or equivalentVideo Memory:128MB512MBDVD-ROM:Quad-speed (4x) DVD-ROM driveHard Drive Space:30GB of Free SpaceOther:Broadband connection required for online gameplay&nbsp;",

Scott Fitzgerald announced his decision to write &quot;somethingnew--something extraordinary and beautiful and simple + intricately patterned.&quot; That extraordinary, beautiful, intricately patterned, and above all, simple novel becameThe Great Gatsby, arguably Fitzgerald's finest work and certainly the book for which he is best known. A portrait of the Jazz Age in all of its decadence and excess,Gatsbycaptured the spirit of the author's generation and earned itself a permanent place in American mythology. Self-made, self-invented millionaire Jay Gatsby embodies some of Fitzgerald's--and his country's--most abiding obsessions: money, ambition, greed, and the promise of new beginnings. &quot;Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther.... And one fine morning--&quot; Gatsby's rise to glory and eventual fall from grace becomes a kind of cautionary tale about the American Dream.It's also a love story, of sorts, the narrative of Gatsby's quixotic passion for Daisy Buchanan. The pair meet five years before the novel begins, when Daisy is a legendary young Louisville beauty and Gatsby an impoverished officer. They fall in love, but while Gatsby serves overseas, Daisy marries the brutal, bullying, but extremely rich Tom Buchanan. After the war, Gatsby devotes himself blindly to the pursuit of wealth by whatever means--and to the pursuit of Daisy, which amounts to the same thing. &quot;Her voice is full of money,&quot; Gatsby says admiringly, in one of the novel's more famous descriptions. His millions made, Gatsby buys a mansion across Long Island Sound from Daisy's patrician East Egg address, throws lavish parties, and waits for her to appear. When she does, events unfold with all the tragic inevitability of a Greek drama, with detached, cynical neighbor Nick Carraway acting as chorus throughout.

There wasn't a funeral that Maylene didn't attend, and at each Rebekkah watched as Maylene performed the same unusual ritual: three sips from a small silver flask followed by the words \"Sleep well, and stay where I put you.\"Now Maylene is dead and Bek must go back to the place--and the man--she left a decade ago. But what she soon discovers is that Maylene was murdered and that there was good reason for her odd traditions. It turns out that in placid Claysville, the worlds of the living and the dead are dangerously connected. Beneath the town lies a shadowy, lawless land ruled by the enigmatic Charles, aka Mr. D--a place from which the dead will return if their graves are not properly minded. Only the Graveminder, a Barrow woman, and the current Undertaker, Byron, can set things to right once the dead begin to walk.A Q&amp;A with Author Melissa MarrQ:What inspires you as a writer?Marr:Music, travel, and lore.Graveminderbegan in 2007 on a trip to Ireland during which I&rsquo;d read a paragraph or so on the &ldquo;hungry dead.&rdquo;Wicked Lovelysparked from Scottish folklore. The YA novel I just wrote,Carnival of Souls, was a combination of a phrase from a song and an article on demonology.Q:Where did the story inGravemindercome from? Did something in particular spark the characters or the plot?Marr:Once I had the general concept (&ldquo;mind your dead lest they come back hungry&rdquo;), I looked to my own life. I enjoy cemeteries, and I&rsquo;m fascinated by lore/myth of Death. I added a small town, a ghost-town-esque land of the dead, and various other things I like. This is actually the novel closest to my roots in many ways.Q:The characters inGraveminderdiscover they have had a destiny to fulfill since they were born. Can you talk about putting characters into that situation and what it brings out in them?Marr:Between the Wicked Lovely series and this, it&rsquo;s pretty obvious I&rsquo;m fascinated by the idea of fate and choice. I think we are all born with advantages and disadvantages because of so many things beyond our control (family, economics, culture, religion, country, genetic factors). People can be defined by those factors, revise their fate&mdash;or opt for some combination of the two.  That choice is what makes our stories as people unique.Q:How did you go about building the Graveminder mythology? Is it based on any folklore or mythology itself?Marr:Around the world there are all sorts of traditions of ancestor regard and duty to the dead. Some traditions dictate how the dead are taken to the grave to keep them from finding their way back if they wake; some traditions include speaking (or not speaking) of them. There are myriad traditions I&rsquo;d have loved to explore, but the one I used at base is that the dead must be nourished with food, drink, and story for a set time. Failure results in the dead coming back to get a different manifestation of the nourishment they need&mdash;flesh, blood, and breath.Q:InGraveminderthe dead walk among the living and the living can even walk among the dead. What are your thoughts about these two worlds you&rsquo;ve created?Marr:I like liminality, borders and those who exist on and because of the lines. Much of the real world is defined by a series of in/out groupings. We are either a or b; things are good or bad; and everything is pro or con. The reality, I believe, is that there are often gradations&mdash;degrees of right and wrong, measures of beautiful and horrible. By juxtaposing worlds, I have characters who are always &ldquo;strangers in a strange land.&rdquo; Plus, well, it&rsquo;s just morefunto write.",

Leslie lives with a father who has given up on life, a drug-abusing brother who allowed his dealer to rape Leslie in lieu of payment, and a burning desire to banish pain and fear from her life. Unable to confide in her best friend, Aislinn, she devotes herself to working to pay the family bills and to get the tattoo she believes will help her reclaim her body. What she doesn't know is that the art she has selected will bind her to Irial, the king of the Dark Court of Fairy. He removes her emotions like fear, panic, or anger, and uses them to nourish the fairies of his court. What Irial doesn't expect is his growing love for Leslie and her desire to make her own choices. In Leslie, Marr has created a damaged, wounded character who still comes across as being incredibly strong. Irial needs to care for his court, knowing them too weak to win a war, but his feelings for Leslie make him unwilling to do what needs to be done. The lesser characters are also well drawn: Rabbit the tattoo artist, his father, Gabriel, and also Aislinn, Keenan, and Seth fromWicked Lovely. While reading that book first would give more shades to some of the characters, it isn't necessary to appreciate the intricate world that Marr creates.&mdash;Lisa Prolman, Greenfield Public Library, MACopyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

That one male lead is a danger-courting archeologist named Omaha Dunn seems less parodic than tired, and the novel's premise of a hoard of antimatter hidden in the legendary city of Ubar is almost as ridiculous as the idea that this cache has been guarded for millennia by an order of women who propagate without men, via parthenogenesis. Rollins writes less like Michael Crichton than Stan Lee. Most of his readers won't care, though, because there's just enough scientific gloss on the nonsense to make it palatable, and anyway, what they want, and what he delivers, is action, as Omaha and an American military agent, Painter, join forces with two Mideastern women, one a scientist, the other a billionaire, to locate the steadily destabilizing antimatter before it's snatched by a villainous cabal, or worse, blows up the planet.

        "B00006HBTW": "It&#x92;s a pretty bold claim but for many,Mario Partyis the best multiplayer game series ever. No need for guns or complicated role-playing elements here--Mario Partyis fun because it&#x92;s simple. The original N64 game created an entirely new subgenre--an unlikely combination of traditional board games and lots of ultrasimple arcade titles. The idea is that you travel around the board trying to collect stars, which must be paid for with coins, and you get coins by competing in minigames, which occur at the end of every round. These minigames generally don&#x92;t last longer than a minute or two, and many are based on oldGame & Watchtitles. There are over 50 minigames inMario Party 4, and each involves either a free-for-all, two players against two, or one against three (depending where you land on the board at the end of your turn). These can involve anything from skydiving to basketball dunking, or car racing to hide-and-seek, to name a few.Admittedly, this basic description of the gameplay might not sound too exciting, and indeed if you&#x92;re playing with less than three human opponents it can be pretty tedious. But play it with the full complement of non-virtual rivals and the game&#x92;s infinite capacity for cheating, backstabbing, and ganging up allows it to completely transcend the humdrum sum of its parts. There&#x92;s nothing terribly new in this third sequel except that the graphics are much improved and the minigames are all new, but that really misses the point: get this game out at Christmas instead ofTrivial Pursuitand you&#x92;ll wonder how you ever got through the holiday without it.--David Jenkins, Amazon.co.uk",
        "0061433012": "Starred Review. Grade 7&ndash;10&mdash;In this first novel for young people set outside of Discworld, Pratchett again shows his humor and humanity. Worlds are destroyed and cultures collide when a tsunami hits islands in a vast ocean much like the Pacific. Mau, a boy on his way back home from his initiation period and ready for the ritual that will make him a man, is the only one of his people, the Nation, to survive. Ermintrude, a girl from somewhere like Britain in a time like the 19th century, is on her way to meet her father, the governor of the Mothering Sunday islands. She is the sole survivor of her ship (or so she thinks), which is wrecked on Mau's island. She reinvents herself as Daphne, and uses her wits and practical sense to help the straggling refugees from nearby islands who start arriving. When raiders land on the island, they are led by a mutineer from the wrecked ship, and Mau must use all of his ingenuity to outsmart him. Then, just as readers are settling in to thinking that all will be well in the new world that Daphne and Mau are helping to build, Pratchett turns the story on its head. The main characters are engaging and interesting, and are the perfect medium for the author's sly humor. Daphne is a close literary cousin of Tiffany Aching in her common sense and keen intelligence wedded to courage. A rich and thought-provoking read.&mdash;Sue Giffard, Ethical Culture Fieldston School, New York CityCopyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But the focus here is less on Decker and his wife, Rina Lazarus, than on Gabe Whitman, the son of a friend who&#x2019;s living with them temporarily. Gabe, a 15-year-old musical prodigy, also has street smarts learned from his mobster father, Chris Donatti, that stand him in good stead when he&#x2019;s &#x201C;crowded&#x201D; and threatened by the clique called the B&amp;W Mafia. Home-schooled Gabe also falls head-over-heels in love with 14-year-old Yasmine Nourmand. While the reciprocal relationship is grounded in love of music (plus raging hormones), it appears doomed by cultural and religious differences. Plot threads intertwine head-on in a violent confrontation, eventually tying up most loose ends extremely satisfactorily.

Divorced from blue-blood architect Talmadge Evans III, but still living in a carriage house in the backyard of their restored mansion, Eloise \"Weezie\" Foley suffers the indignity of having her ex's sexy fianc&#x82;e, Caroline DeSantos, living in the main house Weezie restored herself. As a \"picker,\" Weezie earns her living foraging for discarded treasures in Dumpsters and at estate sales. When she discovers Caroline's corpse in a historic manor house, Weezie is the prime suspect in her murder. To compound her quandary, Weezie's attorney her closeted Uncle James, an ex-Catholic priest is having an illicit affair with a man from the DA's office. Factor in her on-again, off-again romance with old high school flame Daniel Stipanek, counterfeit antiques and her mom's alcoholism, and the plucky heroine has enough problems to drive at least three novels. Unfortunately, the suspense gets lost somewhere among the antiques and Weezie's attempts to consummate her romance with Daniel. But even a denouement that comes way too soon and a junk bin of distractions won't keep readers away. 8-city author tour.

They found each other, adrift but determined, on the streets of New York City in the late '60s and made a pact to keep each other afloat until they found their voices--or the world was ready to hear them. Lovers first and then friends as Mapplethorpe discovered he was gay, they divided their dimes between art supplies and Coney Island hot dogs. Mapplethorpe was quicker to find his metier, with a Polaroid and then a Hasselblad, but Smith was the first to fame, transformed, to her friend's delight, from a poet into a rock star. (Mapplethorpe soon became famous too--and notorious--before his death from AIDS in 1989.) Smith's memoir of their friendship,Just Kids, is tender and artful, open-eyed but surprisingly decorous, with the oracular style familiar from her anthems like \"Because the Night,\" \"Gloria,\" and \"Dancing Barefoot\" balanced by her powers of observation and memory for everyday details like the price of automat sandwiches and the shabby, welcoming fellow bohemians of the Chelsea Hotel, among whose ranks these baby Rimbauds found their way.--Tom Nissley--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

The crew momentarily crossed into North Korea, and Ling and Euna Lee, her editor and translator, were captured. Given the hostilities between North Korea and China and a recent critical documentary on North Korea by Laura&#x2019;s sister, journalist Lisa Ling, the women knew they were in for an ordeal. Laura was beaten during the capture, and the women were held in isolation and faced meager meals, cold, and little medical treatment. In the U.S., Lisa and her family prayed and called on powerful contacts, including Al Gore and Bill Richardson, to win the women&#x2019;s release. During the time of their captivity, North Korea conducted a nuclear test and fired off missiles, increasing tensions with the U.S. and UN. The women were eventually tried for attempting to overthrow the government and sentenced to 12 years in a labor camp, but through behind-the-scenes maneuvering and negotiations with prickly North Korea, they were finally released after five months in captivity. This memoir alternates between the sisters, with Laura recalling the escalating peril of her capture and imprisonment and Lisa recalling heightened worries as weeks dragged into months. A riveting story of captivity and the enduring faith, determination, and love of two sisters. --Vanessa Bush",

His search for his wife  (and his cat) introduces him to a bizarre collection of characters, including two psychic sisters, a possibly unbalanced teenager, an old soldier who witnessed the massacres on the Chinese mainland at the beginning of the Second World War, and a very shady politician.Haruki Murakami is a master of subtly disturbing prose. Mundane events throb with menace, while the bizarre is accepted without comment. Meaning always seems to be just out of reach, for the reader as well as for the characters, yet one is drawn inexorably into a mystery that may have no solution.The Wind-Up Bird Chronicleis an extended meditation on themes that appear throughout Murakami's earlier work. The tropes of popular culture, movies, music, detective stories, combine to create a work that explores both the surface and the hidden depths of Japanese society at the end of the 20th century.If it were possible to isolate one theme inThe Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, that theme would be responsibility. The atrocities committed by the Japanese army in China keep rising to the surface like a repressed memory, and Toru Okada himself is compelled by events to take responsibility for his actions and struggle with his essentially passive nature. If Toru is supposed to be a Japanese Everyman, steeped as he is in Western popular culture and ignorant of the secret history of his own nation, this novel paints a bleak picture. Like the winding up of the titular bird, Murakami slowly twists the gossamer threads of his story into something of considerable weight.--Simon Leake--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

And it's one heck of a fun ride. Matthew Pike is a Fish and Game officer cataloging bear populations in the remote Brooks Range--but he's also an ex-Green Beret, which comes in handy when trouble drops out of the sky in the form of a crashed bush plane, a cryptic survivor, and some very nasty and well-equipped pursuers. Meanwhile, an American submarine stumbles on an abandoned research station buried under the Arctic ice cap, unleashing a race to conceal the horrors that took place there and to capture the priceless scientific secret still locked within.James Rollins invokes the polar environment so vividly you can hear the wind shriek and feel the ice forming on your nose, and the scientific/medical puzzles at the story's heart may remind you of Michael Crichton's best. The characters, while mostly familiar hero or villain types, are crisply drawn and in some cases quite sympathetic, but it's the nonstop action that carries you along.

Indeed, although Harvard physicist Randall does a very nice job of explaining&mdash;often deftly through the use of creative analogies&mdash;how our universe may have many unseen dimensions, readers' heads are likely to be swimming by the end of the book. Randall works hard to make her astoundingly complex material understandable, providing a great deal of background for recent advances in string and supersymmetry theory. As coauthor of the two most important scientific papers on this topic, she's ideally suited to popularize the idea. What is absolutely clear is that physicists simply do not yet know if there are extra dimensions a fraction of a millimeter in size, dimensions of infinite size or only the dimensions we see. What's also clear is that the large hadron collider, the world's most powerful tool for studying subatomic particles, is likely to provide information permitting scientists to differentiate among these ideas soon after it begins operation in Switzerland in 2007. Randall brings much of the excitement of her field to life as she describes her quest to understand the structure of the universe.

Some helpers, like Dr. W.C. Minor, provided literally thousands of entries to the editors. But Minor, an American expatriate in England and a Civil War veteran, was actually a certified lunatic who turned in his dictionary entries from the Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum. Simon Winchester has produced a mesmerizing coda to the deeply troubled Minor's life, a life that in one sense began with the senseless murder of an innocent British brewery worker that the deluded Minor believed was an assassin sent by one of his numerous &quot;enemies.&quot;Winchester also paints a rich portrait of the OED's leading light, Professor James Murray, who spent more than 40 years of his life on a project he would not see completed in his lifetime. Winchester traces the origins of the drive to create a &quot;Big Dictionary&quot; down through Murray and far back into the past; the result is a fascinating compact history of the English language (albeit admittedly more interesting to linguistics enthusiasts than historians or true crime buffs). That Murray and Minor, whose lives took such wildly disparate turns yet were united in their fierce love of language, were able to view one another as peers and foster a warm friendship is just one of the delicately turned subplots of this compelling book.--Tjames Madison",

Fast food is so ubiquitous that it now seems as American, and harmless, as apple pie. But the industry's drive for consolidation, homogenization, and speed has radically transformed America's diet, landscape, economy, and workforce, often in insidiously destructive ways. Eric Schlosser, an award-winning journalist, opens his ambitious and ultimately devastating expos&eacute; with an introduction to the iconoclasts and high school dropouts, such as Harlan Sanders and the McDonald brothers, who first applied the principles of a factory assembly line to a commercial kitchen. Quickly, however, he moves behind the counter with the overworked and underpaid teenage workers, onto the factory farms where the potatoes and beef are grown, and into the slaughterhouses run by giant meatpacking corporations. Schlosser wants you to know why those French fries taste so good (with a visit to the world's largest flavor company) and \"what really lurks between those sesame-seed buns.\" Eater beware: forget your concerns about cholesterol, there is--literally--feces in your meat.Schlosser's investigation reaches its frightening peak in the meatpacking plants as he reveals the almost complete lack of federal oversight of a seemingly lawless industry. His searing portrayal of the industry is disturbingly similar to Upton Sinclair'sThe Jungle, written in 1906: nightmare working conditions, union busting, and unsanitary practices that introduceE. coliand other pathogens into restaurants, public schools, and homes. Almost as disturbing is his description of how the industry \"both feeds and feeds off the young,\" insinuating itself into all aspects of children's lives, even the pages of their school books, while leaving them prone to obesity and disease. Fortunately, Schlosser offers some eminently practical remedies. \"Eating in the United States should no longer be a form of high-risk behavior,\" he writes. Where to begin?

At 60, he is suffering from a badly mangled, constantly aching knee, the consequence of a typically foolish accident; his pickup truck is moribund; his long-time mistress is restive; his ex-wife is on the verge of a nervous breakdown and his son Peter has come home for Thanksgiving with news that his marriage is disintegrating and that he has lost his job. Sully's sagging fortunes are mirrored by his community's decline. North Bath, N.Y., is a town prosperity has shunned: its signature hot springs mysteriously dried up years ago and a projected Ultimate Escape theme park is doomed never to materialize. Sully's financial problems might be solved by the sale of his dead father's dilapidated house, but Sully's gnawing hatred of Big Jim, a viciously mean, hypocritical bully, renders him incapable of profiting from his father's estate. His emotional distance from Big Jim left Sully incapable of forging a bond with Peter, or indeed, of establishing any relationship that he cannot address with a wisecrack or a teasing quip. In fact (and somewhat improbably), all the characters in the novel have the gift of a silver tongue: the dialogue often consists of verbal sparring, insults exhanged in comradely fashion. The narrative brims with memorable portraits: Sully's mentally dim and odoriferous sidekick, Rub Squeers; his feisty 80-year-old landlady and former grade-school teacher, Miss Beryl; his ex-wife, a woman animated by moral outrage and self pity; his mistress's stiletto-tongued daughter and her waif-like, wall-eyed child; his one-legged alcoholic lawyer--even his thoroughly wicked grandson, the pint-sized reincarnation of Big Jim. In delivering these personalities with a Dickensian skill, Russo again proves himself a shrewd observer of human nature, whose universal failings he scrutinizes with a comic eye and a compassionate heart. 50,000 first printing; major ad/promo; author tour.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",
        "0061784796": "Amazon Exclusive: Q &amp; A with James RollinsQ:InBloodline, you introduce two new characters, Tucker and Kane, a pair unlike any your readers have seen before. Tell us about them, and why you decided to write about them?James Rollins:First of all, I wanted to honor these unique American heroes. Tucker Wayne is a former captain with the Army Rangers. After two tours of duty in Afghanistan, he leaves the service disillusioned after a bloody battle. Aided by members of his own unit, Tucker steals his war dog, Kane.What I liked best about exploring this pair's unique relationship is a phrase commonly used by military war dog handlers--It runs down the lead--describing how the emotions of the pair became shared over time, binding them together as firmly as any leash. And it's that bond and ability for the two to operate as one that I wanted to explore in this novel.Q:Can you tell us about your research into military dogs?JR:About a year and half ago, I was lucky enough to participate in a USO tour of authors to military bases in Iraq and Kuwait. There, I saw several of these war dogs in action. I was also able to meet and talk to a veterinary school classmate of mine who works with the veterinary corps out in Iraq. After that encounter, it got me thinking about writing this book, of honoring these unique war heroes on the page.Q:Women play a large role inBloodline. How are you able to write from the point of view of women so well?JR:I have three sisters who make sure I get those details correct, but also during my USO tour to Iraq and Kuwait, I got a chance to talk at length to women in the field--to hear what it's like to be a female in the armed services. And that'[s something I tried to capture accurately.Q:Your novels always delve into the cutting edge of science. What is the scientific basis behindBloodline?JR:The root of this book came from a recent article inTimemagazine. The cover declared:2045, the Year Man Becomes Immortal. I read that and wondered how that could become true. Could immortality be achievable in our lifetime? It sent me into a yearlong and chilling investigation into the frontiers of life extension.Q:What are some of these new discoveries involving immortality?JR:I've learned that there are actually two competing schools of study when it comes to the search for immortality. On one side, scientists are looking at moving man into machines, moving our consciousness into a synthetic arena. Scientists in Switzerland right now are working with IBM to create the firstvirtualhuman brain and say they are about a decade off from achieving this goal.On the other side of the scientific fence, researchers are also looking at moving machines into us: basically replacing our failing parts with artificial organs. We already have synthetic pancreases and mechanical hearts, and these scientific advancements continue to accelerate, especially with the explosive growth of nanotechnology, which involves engineering at the atomic level.Q:Now to the last and most pressing question: How close are we to achieving immortality?JR:That's a good question--and the answer is the most startling revelation I discovered while researching this story, something I share within the pages of this book. InBloodline, readers will learn a shocking scientific truth about the nature of mankind: That immortal beings already walk among us today.If you want to know who they are, if you want to learn how to live forever--readBloodline.",

Now he's unemployed and is finally  starting to enjoy his new role as stay-at-home dad. All would be domestic bliss  if it were not for Jack's suspicions that his wife, who's been behaving  strangely and working long hours at the top-secret research labs of Xymos  Technology, is having an affair. When he's called in to help with her hush-hush  project, it seems like the perfect opportunity to see what his wife's been  doing, but Jack quickly finds there's a lot more going on in the lab than an  illicit affair. Within hours of his arrival at the remote testing center, Jack  discovers his wife's firm has created self-replicating nanotechnology--a literal  swarm of microscopic machines. Originally meant to serve as a military eye in  the sky, the swarm has now escaped into the environment and is seemingly intent  on killing the scientists trapped in the facility. The reader realizes early,  however, that Jack, his wife, and fellow scientists have more to fear from the  hidden dangers within the lab than from the predators without.The monsters may be smaller in this book, but Crichton's skill for suspense has  grown, makingPreya scary read that's hard to set aside, though not  without its minor flaws. The science in this novel requires more explanation  than did the cloning of dinosaurs, leading to lengthy and sometimes dry academic  lessons. And while the coincidence of Xymos's new technology running on the same  program Jack created at his previous job keeps the plot moving, it may be more  than some readers can swallow. But, thanks in part to a sobering foreword in  which Crichton warns of the real dangers of technology that continues to evolve  more quickly than common sense,Preysucceeds in gripping readers with a  tense and frightening tale of scientific suspense.--Benjamin Reese--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

It's already here, living in the head of the guy who just crossed the street in front of you, or maybe even closer than that. We saw these possibilities get played out in the author's bloodsporting-anarchist-yuppie shocker of a first novel,Fight Club.  Now, inSurvivor, his second and newest, the concern is more for the origin of the malaise. Starting at chapter 47 and screaming toward ground zero, Palahniuk hurls the reader back to the beginning in a breathless search for where it all went wrong. This time out, the author's protagonist is self-made, self-ruined mogul-messiah Tender Branson, the sole passenger of a jet moments away from slamming first into the Australian outback and then into oblivion. All that will be left, Branson assures us with a tone bordering on relief, is his life story, from its Amish-on-acid cult beginnings to its televangelist-huckster end. All of this courtesy of the plane's flight recorder.Speaking of little black boxes, Skinnerians would have a field day with the presenting behavior of the folks who make up Palahniuk's world. They pretend they're suicide hotline operators for fun. They eat lobster before it's quite... done. They dance in morgues. The Cleavers they are not. Scary as they might be, these characters are ultimately more scared of themselves than you are, and that's what makes them so fascinating. In the wee hours and on lonely highways, they exist in a perpetual twilight, caught between the horror of the present and the dread of the unknown.

Smith writes humbly, forswearing judgment on the validity of world religions. His introduction asks, &quot;How does it all sound from above? Like bedlam, or do the strains blend in strange, ethereal harmony? ... We cannot know. All we can do is try to listen carefully and with full attention to each voice in turn as it addresses the divine. Such listening defines the purpose of this book.&quot; His criteria for inclusion and analysis of religions in this book are &quot;relevance to the modern mind&quot; and &quot;universality,&quot; and his interest in each religion is more concerned with its principles than its context. Therefore, he avoids cataloging the horrors and crimes of which religions have been accused, and he attempts to show each &quot;at their best.&quot; YetThe World's Religionsis no pollyannaish romp: &quot;It is about religion alive,&quot; Huston writes. &quot;It calls the soul to the highest adventure it can undertake, a proposed journey across the jungles, peaks, and deserts of the human spirit. The call is to confront reality.&quot; And by translating the voices of Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Confucianism, Christianity, and Judaism, among others, Smith has amplified the divine call for generations of readers.--Michael Joseph Gross--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

        "006114665X": "The immense documentation of the origin of WWI, remarks historian Clark, can be marshaled to support a range of theses, and it but weakly sustains, in the tenor of his intricate analysis, the temptation to assign exclusive blame for the cataclysm to a particular country. Dispensing with a thesis, Clark interprets evidence in terms of the character, internal political heft, and external geopolitical perception and intention of a political actor. In other words, Clark centralizes human agency and, especially, human foibles of misperception, illogic, and emotion in his narrative. Touching on every significant figure in European diplomacy in the decade leading to August 1914, Clark underscores an entanglement of an official&#x2019;s fluctuating domestic power with a foreign interlocutor&#x2019;s appreciation, accurate or not, of that official&#x2019;s ability to make something stick in foreign policy. As narrative background, Clark choreographs the alliances and series of crises that preceded the one provoked by the assassination of Franz Ferdinand, but he focuses on the men whose risk-taking mistakes detonated WWI. Emphasizing the human element, Clark bestows a tragic sensibility on a magisterial work of scholarship. --Gilbert Taylor",

        "0060931418": "At the height of the Harlem Renaissance during the 1930s, Zora Neale Hurston was the preeminent black woman writer in the United States. She was a sometime-collaborator withLangston Hughesand a fierce rival ofRichard Wright. Her stories appeared in major magazines, she consulted on Hollywood screenplays, and she penned four novels, an autobiography, countless essays, and two books on black mythology. Yet by the late 1950s, Hurston was living in obscurity, working as a maid in a Florida hotel. She died in 1960 in a Welfare home, was buried in an unmarked grave, and quickly faded from literary consciousness until 1975 whenAlice Walkeralmost single-handedly revived interest in her work.Of Hurston's fiction,Their Eyes Were Watching Godis arguably the best-known and perhaps the most controversial. The novel follows the fortunes of Janie Crawford, a woman living in the black town of Eaton, Florida. Hurston sets up her characters and her locale in the first chapter, which, along with the last, acts as a framing device for the story of Janie's life. Unlike Wright andRalph Ellison, Hurston does not write explicitly about black people in the context of a white world--a fact that earned her scathing criticism from the social realists--but she doesn't ignore the impact of black-white relations either:It was the time for sitting on porches beside the road. It was the time to hear things and talk. These sitters had been tongueless, earless, eyeless conveniences all day long. Mules and other brutes had occupied their skins. But now, the sun and the bossman were gone, so the skins felt powerful and human. They became lords of sounds and lesser things. They passed nations through their mouths. They sat in judgment.One person the citizens of Eaton are inclined to judge is Janie Crawford, who has married three men and been tried for the murder of one of them. Janie feels no compulsion to justify herself to the town, but shedoesexplain herself to her friend, Phoeby, with the implicit understanding that Phoeby can \"tell 'em what Ah say if you wants to. Dat's just de same as me 'cause mah tongue is in mah friend's mouf.\"Hurston's use of dialect enraged other African American writers such as Wright, who accused her of pandering to white readers by giving them the black stereotypes they expected. Decades later, however, outrage has been replaced by admiration for her depictions of black life, and especially the lives of black women. InTheir Eyes Were Watching GodZora Neale Hurston breathes humanity into both her men and women, and allows them to speak in their own voices.--Alix Wilber",

On her way home to New Jersey after an awkward party for her lifelong friend Claire's highly autobiographical first novel, Alison gets into a car accident that kills a boy in the other car. Even though the accident wasn't her fault, Allison, a mother of two young children, is wracked with grief and guilt. Her husband, Charlie, also struggles with the impulse to blame his wife, especially as he longs for any excuse to escalate his nascent affair with Claire and end his marriage. Episodes detailing the inevitable collapse of Alison and Charlie's marriage, as well as Claire's marriage to her well-meaning husband, Ben, are interspersed with vignettes revealing the four friends' 10-plus&ndash;year history together. Shifting perspectives and thoughtful interior monologues reveal just how isolated, and in some cases misguided, the characters are. Kline's unflinching gaze and lovely prose sets Kline's novel apart from the herd of infidelity/marital ennui novels. It's well-done, thoughtful and thought provoking.(Aug.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The story opens in 1899 with the funeral of Elizabeth Holland, a well-bred beauty said to have plunged to her death in the Hudson River. The narrative then travels back several weeks, tracing the relationships and events that have led to the somber assembly. This tangled web includes not one but two sets of star-crossed lovers; an upstairs/downstairs romance; a scheming social climber; a bitter servant girl; and oodles of money, all set in a Edith Wharton via Hollywood vision of Old New York.

        "0099472252": "Alice Munro has been accused of telling the same story over and over, and to a certain extent the characterization is true. Her subject matter is inevitably the vagaries of love between middle-aged people in some rural Canadian setting, trapped there by the combination of their desires and weaknesses. Or, if not love, then at least the mysteries of relationships as characters struggle to understand each other and themselves. But this thematic single-mindedness can hardly be considered a criticism considering Munro tells stories better than anybody else and with a level of precision matched by few. It would be like criticizing Shakespeare for writing about politics.Runawayis no exception. The stories take place throughout Canada--northern Ontario, the Prairies, the West Coast, Stratford--and feature women and men drifting in and out of each other's orbits, pulled by forces they don't understand. In \"Runaway,\" a woman considers leaving her husband with the help of a neighbor, but the husband has other plans. In \"Chance,\" a woman leaves her life behind in a quest for a man she met on a train crossing the country. Their intertwined lives play out through two more stories, \"Soon\" and \"Silence,\" but the path they follow is as unpredictable to the reader as it is to them. In \"Trespasses,\" a small town's women dream of escaping their lives only to find themselves in lives they never imagined.What really marks the stories is Munro's sense of mood. There's a sense of hidden menace or even violence everywhere inRunaway. It occasionally erupts, but always in surprising and unexpected ways, and with unintended consequences. Munro may be an old-fashioned storyteller, but she understands chaos theory well enough. The same story? Sure.

The quartet comprises not only Amelia's diary of those years but also parts of a mysterious \"Manuscript H,\" an omniscient viewpoint that allows a glimpse into the minds of Amelia's son--the dashing and brilliant Ramses--and her ward, Nefret Forth, as they mature into adults with their own secrets and agendas.The Falcon at the Portalleft readers hanging impatiently in the enormous rift that book's events gouged between Ramses and Nefret, both madly in love but unrelentingly proud.The winter of 1914-15 finds the Peabody-Emerson family back in Cairo--now under British martial law, with the Suez Canal under constant threat of attack from the Ottoman Empire. The city's young Englishmen are rushing to enlist, except for Ramses, who is widely scorned for his pacifism. Yet Amelia and Emerson soon find out that Ramses is (literally) playing a mysterious and potentially explosive part in the conflict between Egyptian nationalists and the British authorities, for reasons both political and familial. Nefret, for her part, is still running a health clinic for the city's fallen women and trying to avoid the attentions of Percy, Amelia's odious nephew. In the meantime, the Emersons' excavations at Giza reveal an unexpected treasure so remarkable that the uneasy Amelia immediately senses the fine hand of Sethos, the Master Criminal (who through many previous books has alternately plagued her and protested his boundless affection for her), at work. The climax and denouement are entirely worth the price of admission--tying up a decade's worth of loose strings and explaining some nagging points so subtle that less observant readers might easily have missed them. It's Peters's great gift that in the grand scheme of things, no clues are wasted. Her plotting is wonderfully complex and intriguing, and it fits seamlessly into the detailed historical background she builds so carefully. It may have taken years for her to complete this four-part dance (she promises more Amelia Peabody mysteries in the future), but she's charmed us right out of our dancing slippers along the way.--Barrie Trinkle--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

The Republican senator from Arizona has a remarkable story to tell--better than just about any of his peers--and he tells it well, with crisp prose and an unexpected sense for narrative pacing. The first half of the book concerns his naval forbears: his grandfather commanded an aircraft carrier in the Second World War, while his father presided over all naval forces in the Pacific during the Vietnam War. They were the first father-son admirals in American history. Young John McCain knew he had enormous shoes to fill and rebelled against many of the expectations set for him. At the Naval Academy, he was nearly expelled, graduating fifth from the bottom of his class. He never became an admiral, but achieved fame another way: as a naval aviator in 1967, he was shot down over North Vietnam and spent several years in POW camps, where he was beaten, tortured, and nearly allowed to die. McCain describes the awful details of his imprisonment and tells how he stayed mentally strong during seemingly endless months of solitary confinement and how he communicated in code with fellow captives.Faith of My Fathersconcludes with McCain's release and contains no information about his subsequent political career.

It&rsquo;s quite a startling device (I loved it in Joshua Ferris&rsquo;sThen We Came to the End). Why did you use it inThe Most Dangerous Thing?Laura Lippman:The decision was intuitive at first&mdash;that is, I knew it was right, without knowing why it was right. When I finished the book, I realized that these passages are a consensual version of what happened in the past, that the survivors have agreed on what happened and that&rsquo;s why the story is, at turns, unflattering to each of them. They are working out their level of culpability in several tragedies and they just can&rsquo;t face this alone. And that voice allowed me to include a subtext of gloom and foreboding&mdash;the story is being told by people who know how badly it ends.KA:Do you think you write better now than you did when you first began to write novels? (I only ask because I think I&rsquo;m a much better writer than I used to be but no one else seems to have noticed.) Do you feel you can trust your &ldquo;inner critic&rdquo; or are you plagued by doubts the whole time you are writing?LL:At the risk of sounding obsequious, I have to say that you set the bar awfully high for yourself withBehind the Scenes at the Museum, but I&rsquo;ve noticed how your work has changed, although I think the word that comes to mind isn&rsquo;t better, but bolder. You take such big risks and yet you manage them with aplomb. The frustration of being a fan of your work is that there&rsquo;s nothing quite like it. There are lots of wonderful writers in crime and literary fiction, but there&rsquo;s only person who can write a Kate Atkinson novel.I didn&rsquo;t start out on the same level.

I do think crime writers need to take a moment for introspection about the stories we&rsquo;re telling and the bodies that are piling up around us. It&rsquo;s somber stuff. There should be an agenda beyond sensation.KA:How many novels do you have on the back burner at any one time? Have you ever sat down to write and not had any idea what you were going to do?LL:Once&mdash;just once&mdash;I managed to have two projects going on simultaneously, a novel and a novella. I do best with one thing in front of me. And, increasingly, I have no idea what I&rsquo;m going to write next. But that&rsquo;s part of the job and, for me, part of the fun. I know a book is finished when I&rsquo;m ready to sit down and ask myself, &ldquo;What next, what interests me right now?&rdquo; WithThe Most Dangerous Thing, I was interested in the way life becomes a kind of horror film at middle age. About two months after I started this book, my father-in-law died after a long decline. About the same time, one of my husband&rsquo;s oldest friends, dating back to his days on the college newspaper, had a stroke at the age of 48, and died within hours. Yesterday, I picked upThe New York Timesand happened on a first-person piece by a former colleague, who wrote about having ALS and his intention to commit suicide while he was still able-bodied. He's only 66.But I also became a parent for the first time last year, which isn&rsquo;t one of the typical milestones of middle-age, yet there it was. And it had a huge impact on the book.KA:Do you feel guilty when you&rsquo;re not writing, even when the other thing you&rsquo;re doing is totally fulfilling or completely altruistic or utterly well deserved?LL:If I&rsquo;ve been disciplined&mdash;gone to my desk every weekday morning, written at least 1,000 words&mdash;I seldom feel guilty. I feel much more guilt-ridden about not reading enough.But I will steal a line from Anne Lamott, who once said if people knew how good she felt writing they would set her on fire.

Newly divorced 44-year-old marketing consultant Lake Warren finds her latest job devising a marketing plan for a Manhattan fertility clinic rewarding until her ex-husband, Jack, sues for full custody of their two young children. While her lawyer warns her not even to date so Jack won't have leverage against her, Lake gives in to a one-night stand with the clinic's flirtatious Dr. Keaton. After falling asleep on his penthouse terrace, Lake wakes to find Keaton murdered. Worried that the police will accuse her of the murder, Lake begins her own investigation until she learns that someone is stalking her. A subplot about the clinic's questionable practices adds to the tension, but doesn't detract from the main plot with its myriad twists.(Feb.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0060589469": "In his now classicZen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, Robert Pirsig brings us a literary chautauqua, a novel that is meant to both entertain and edify. It scores high on both counts.Phaedrus, our narrator, takes a present-tense cross-country motorcycle trip with his son during which the maintenance of the motorcycle becomes an illustration of how we can unify the cold, rational realm of technology with the warm, imaginative realm of artistry. As in Zen, the trick is to become one with the activity, to engage in it fully, to see and appreciate all details--be it hiking in the woods, penning an essay, or tightening the chain on a motorcycle.In his autobiographical first novel, Pirsig wrestles both with the ghost of his past and with the most important philosophical questions of the 20th century--why has technology alienated us from our world? what are the limits of rational analysis? if we can't define the good, how can we live it? Unfortunately, while exploring the defects of our philosophical heritage from Socrates and the Sophists to Hume and Kant, Pirsig inexplicably stops at the middle of the 19th century. With the exception of Poincar&eacute;, he ignores the more recent philosophers who have tackled his most urgent questions, thinkers such as Peirce, Nietzsche (to whom Phaedrus bears a passing resemblance), Heidegger, Whitehead, Dewey, Sartre, Wittgenstein, and Kuhn. In the end, the narrator's claims to originality turn out to be overstated, his reasoning questionable, and his understanding of the history of Western thought sketchy. His solution to a synthesis of the rational and creative by elevating Quality to a metaphysical level simply repeats the mistakes of the premodern philosophers. But in contrast to most other philosophers, Pirsig writes a compelling story. And he is a true innovator in his attempt to popularize a reconciliation of Eastern mindfulness and nonrationalism with Western subject/object dualism. The magic ofZen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenanceturns out to lie not in the answers it gives, but in the questions it raises and the way it raises them. Like a cross betweenThe Razor's EdgeandSophie's World,Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenancetakes us into \"the high country of the mind\" and opens our eyes to vistas of possibility.--Brian Bruya--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

The Lace Reader retains the strange magic of a vivid dream, though Barry's portrayal of modern-day Salem, Massachusetts--with its fascinating cast of eccentrics--is reportedly spot-on. Some of its stranger residents include generations of Whitney women, with a gift for seeing the future in the lace they make. Towner Whitney, back to Salem from self-imposed exile on the West Coast, has plans for recuperation that evaporate with her great-aunt Eva's mysterious drowning. Fighting fear from a traumatic adolescence she can barely remember, Towner digs in for answers. But questions compound with the disappearance of a young woman under the thrall of a local fire-and-brimstone preacher, whose history of violence against Whitney women makes the situation personal for Towner. Her role in cop John Rafferty's investigation sparks a tentative romance. And as they scramble to avert disaster, the past that had slipped through the gaps in Towner's memory explodes into the present with a violence that capsizes her concept of truth.

Echoes of Yossarian, the wise-ass bombardier who was too smart to die but not smart enough to find a way out of his predicament, could be heard throughout the counterculture. As a result, it's impossible not to considerCatch-22to be something of a period piece. But 40 years on, the  novel's undiminished strength is its looking-glass logic. Again and again, Heller's characters demonstrate that what is commonly held to be good, is bad; what is sensible, is nonsense.Yossarian says, &quot;You're talking about winning the war, and I am talking about winning the war and keeping alive.&quot;&quot;Exactly,&quot; Clevinger snapped smugly. &quot;And which do you think is more important?&quot;&quot;To whom?&quot; Yossarian shot back. &quot;It doesn't make a damn bit of difference who wins the war to someone who's dead.&quot;&quot;I can't think of another attitude that could be depended upon to give greater comfort to the enemy.&quot;&quot;The enemy,&quot; retorted Yossarian with weighted precision, &quot;is anybody who's going to get you killed, no matter which side he's on.&quot;Mirabile dictu, the book holds up post-Reagan, post-Gulf War.

Throughout, Johnson's history is driven by a philosophical interest: \"The Jews,\" he writes, \"stand right at the centre of the perennial attempt to give human life the dignity of a purpose. Does their own history suggest that such attempts are worth making? Or does it reveal their essential futility?\" Johnson's history is lucid, thorough, and--as one would expect of almost any project with such a broad scope--a little wrong-headed. By the end of the book, readers will be grateful for Johnson's questioning of the Jews' confidence in their cosmic significance. However, readers may also be a little annoyed by his energetic inquiries as to whether this significance was man-made or providentially provided. Either way, it's a given: for a historian of Israel, this should adequately settle the question.

This is the first of a slated multi-book series that, judging by this first book, will help reinvigorate a traditional YA genre that's grown a bit light on strong character development. So, gear-up sci-fi fans, the battle for Earth is on and there's a new kid in town!--Lauren Nemroff",
        "0062070401": "Gr 6-9-A young teen who is descended from mythological beings and has extraordinary powers is trained in a secret facility with others like him. He finds himself on the run with a small group of his peers, battling other supernatural beings in a race to find a powerful artifact and avert disaster. Hmm, sounds familiar. This is not The Lightning Thief (Hyperion, 2005) and the mythology is the lost city of Atlantis rather than the Greek pantheon, but comparisons with the \"Percy Jackson\" series are inevitable. Unfortunately, this volume hardly measures up. Jack McKinley is just not as likable or believable as Rick Riordan's protagonist, and the supporting characters are flat. There are far too many deus ex machina moments needed to move the story along (e.g., Marco falling to his death but landing just close enough to a magic waterfall to not actually die). There is plenty of action throughout, and some of it is quite original (nearly dying under a mountain of flaming bat guano is certainly \"fresh\"), but it is not enough to make up for the uneven plot and weak characters.-Anthony C.

There they search for a third key, alluded to by a forensic anthropologist friend and colleague recently killed in a hit-and-run accident.

But 70 years later, as her great-granddaughter, Grace, is mourning her father&#x2019;s death, Maggie decides it&#x2019;s finally time to share her story. Inspired by the true tale of an Irish community that suffered the largest proportional loss in the sinking, the novel hits on the standard elements of the Titanic story&#x2014;the ship&#x2019;s magnificence, the stark differences between first and third classes, the many elements that contributed to its downfall. What makes Gaynor&#x2019;s novel fresh is the way she sets the tragedy in the context of her characters&#x2019; lives. Gaynor is a gentle storyteller who doesn&#x2019;t challenge the reader, writing prettily but at times predictably. At the same time, even the most avid Titanic buff is sure to find something new in this well-researched, finely detailed story. Just as Maggie&#x2019;s retelling makes the disaster real for her great-granddaughter, Gaynor brings immediacy to the oft-told story by shrinking it to a human scale. --Bridget Thoreson",

Neil Gaiman, creator of the darkly elegant Sandman comics and author ofThe Day I Swapped My Dad for Two Goldfish, tells the story of young Tristran Thorn and his adventures in the land of Faerie. One fateful night, Tristran promises his beloved that he will retrieve a fallen star for her from beyond the Wall that stands between their rural English town (called, appropriately, Wall) and the Faerie realm. No one ever ventures beyond the Wall except to attend an enchanted flea market that is held every nine years (and during which, unbeknownst to him, Tristran was conceived). But Tristran bravely sets out to fetch the fallen star and thus win the hand of his love. His adventures in the magical land will keep you turning pages as fast as you can--he and the star escape evil old witches, deadly clutching trees, goblin press-gangs, and the scheming sons of the dead Lord of Stormhold. The story is by turns thrillingly scary and very funny. You'll love goofy, earnest Tristran and the talking animals, gnomes, magic trees, and other irresistible denizens of Faerie that he encounters in his travels.Stardustis a perfect read-aloud book, a brand-new fairy tale you'll want to share with a kid, or maybe hoard for yourself.

The diaries cover Andr&eacute;n's time as a foreman on the building of the transcontinental railroad in the United States. An extended flashback charts the journey of a railroad worker, San, who was kidnapped in China and shipped to America in 1863. After finding evidence linking a mysterious Chinese man to the Hesj&ouml;vallen murders, Roslin travels to Beijing, suspecting that the motive for the horrific crime is rooted in the past.

They are all examples of disruptive technologies that helped to redefine the competitive landscape of their respective markets. These products did not come about as the result of successful companies carrying out sound business practices in established markets. InThe Innovator's Dilemma, author Clayton M. Christensen shows how these and other products cut into the low end of the marketplace and eventually evolved to displace high-end competitors and their reigning technologies.At the heart ofThe Innovator's Dilemmais how a successful company with established products keeps from being pushed aside by newer, cheaper products that will, over time, get better and become a serious threat. Christensen writes that even the best-managed companies, in spite of their attention to customers and continual investment in new technology, are susceptible to failure no matter what the industry, be it hard drives or consumer retailing. Succinct and clearly written,The Innovator's Dilemmais an important book that belongs on every manager's bookshelf. Highly recommended.--Harry C.

        "0061123226": "PreSchool-Grade 1&mdash;In bold, unornamented line drawings of a rabbit and a box, the author-illustrator offers a paean to the time-honored imaginative play of young children who can turn a cardboard box into whatever their creativity can conjure. Through a series of paired questions and answers, the rabbit is queried about why he is sitting in, standing on, spraying, or wearing a box. Each time, he insists, \"It's not a box!\" and the opposite page reveals the many things a small child's pretending can make of one: a race car, a mountain, a burning building, a robot. One important caveat: the younger end of the intended audience is both literal and concrete in their approach to this material. The box itself, drawn as a one-dimensional rectangle, will be perceived by preschoolers to be flat and not readily understood as three-dimensional. Furthermore, those children are likely to interpret the \"box's\" transformation to be \"magic,\" while five- and six-year-olds are able to make the cognitive conversion from flat rectangle to three-dimensional box and to understand that the transformation has been made by the rabbit's own imagination. Both audiences will enjoy the participatory aspect of identifying each of the rabbit's new inventions. Knowledgeable adults will bring along a large box to aid in understanding and to encourage even more ideas and play.&mdash;Kate McClelland, Perrot Memorial Library, Old Greenwich, CTCopyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "006087290X": "In her assured but overstuffed horror debut, Langan lovingly crafts the struggling town of Bedford, Maine, its unlucky inhabitants and the troubling history of the town's shuttered paper mill, before tearing it all to bloody pieces. Bedford is haunted by the beautiful Susan Marley, a damaged young woman who wanders the streets and never speaks a word, stirring \"feeling[s] of something undone, something quite wrong, at the sight of her.\" Those feelings are strongest in Susan's maladjusted little sister, Liz, wracked with guilt over Susan's fate; their mother, who refuses to acknowledge her wayward daughter's existence; and alcoholic high school teacher Paul Martin, who once had an affair with Susan. Susan's fall to her death in the final, rain-soaked days of winter triggers a series of events that bring the buried secrets of the town to terrifying reality&mdash;people and animals rise from the dead, and a spirit of homicidal rage grips the living. Fighting to survive, Langan's characters come brilliantly to life, their inner conflicts rendered in sharp but exhausting detail at once expansive and constricting, slowing the narrative to a crawl just before it whips into frenzied, graphic violence. This is horror on a big scale, akin to the more ambitious work of Stephen King, and though Langan's enormous imagination can slow her narrative, this effective debut promises great things to come.(Oct.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Now, Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner return withSuperFreakonomics,and fans and newcomers alike will find that the freakquel is even bolder, funnier, and more surprising than the first.Four years in the making,SuperFreakonomicsasks not only the tough questions, but the unexpected ones: What's more dangerous, driving drunk orwalkingdrunk? Why is chemotherapy prescribed so often if it's so ineffective? Can a sex change boost your salary?SuperFreakonomicschallenges the way we think all over again, exploring the hidden side of everything with such questions as:How is a street prostitute like a department-store Santa?Why are doctors so bad at washing their hands?How much good do car seats do?What's the best way to catch a terrorist?Did TV cause a rise in crime?What do hurricanes, heart attacks, and highway deaths have in common?Are people hard-wired for altruism or selfishness?Can eating kangaroo save the planet?Which adds more value: a pimp or a Realtor?Levitt and Dubner mix smart thinking and great storytelling like no one else, whether investigating a solution to global warming or explaining why the price of oral sex has fallen so drastically. By examining how people respond to incentives, they show the world for what it really is &#150; good, bad, ugly, and, in the final analysis, super freaky.Freakonomicshas been imitated many times over &#150; but only now, withSuperFreakonomics,has it met its match.FromSuperfreakonomics: Where do you stand on the freak-o-meter?Four years ago, you were cool. You readFreakonomicswhen it first came out. You impressed family and friends and dazzled dates with the insights you gleaned. Now Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner return withSuperfreakonomics, afreakquel even bolder, funnier, and more surprising than the first.Have you been keeping up?  Can you call yourself a SuperFreak? Test yourSuperfreakonomicsknow-how now:Question 1:5 pointsAccording toSuperfreakonomics, what has been most helpful in improving the lives of women in rural India?A. The government ban on dowries and sex-selective abortionsB. The spread of cable and satellite televisionC. Projects that pay women to not abort female babiesD. Condoms made specially for the Indian marketQuestion 2:3 pointsAmong Chicago street prostitutes, which night of the week is the most profitable?A. SaturdayB. MondayC. WednesdayD. FridayQuestion 3:5 pointsYou land in an emergency room with a serious condition and your fate lies in the hands of the doctor you draw. Which characteristic doesn&#x2019;t seem to matter in terms of doctor skill?A. Attended a top-ranked medical school and served a residency at a prestigious hospitalB. Is femaleC. Gets high ratings from peersD. Spends more money on treatmentQuestion 4:3 pointsWhich cancer is chemotherapy more likely to be effective for?A. Lung cancerB. MelanomaC. LeukemiaD. Pancreatic cancerQuestion 5:5 pointsHalf of the decline in deaths from heart disease is mainly attributable to:A. Inexpensive drugsB. AngioplastyC. GraftsD. StentsQuestion 6:3 pointsTrue or False: Child car seats do a better job of protecting children over the age of 2 from auto fatalities than regular seat belts.Question 7:5 pointsWhat&#x2019;s the best thing a person can do  personally  to cut greenhouse gas emissions?A. Drive a hybrid carB. Eat one less hamburger a weekC. Buy all your food from local sourcesQuestion 8:3 pointsWhich is most effective at stopping the greenhouse effect?A. Public-awareness campaigns to discourage consumptionB. Cap-and-trade agreements on carbon emissionsC. Volcanic explosionsD. Planting lots of treesQuestion 9:5 pointsIn the 19th century, one of the gravest threats of childbearing was puerperal fever, which was often fatal to mother and child.  Its cause was finally determined to be:A. Tight bindings of petticoats early in the pregnancyB. Foul air in the delivery wardsC. Doctors not taking sanitary precautionsD. The mother rising too soon in the delivery roomQuestion 10:3 pointsWhich of the following were not aftereffects of the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks on September 11, 2001:A. The decrease in airline traffic slowed the spread of influenza.B. Thanks to extra police in Washington, D.C., crime fell in that city.C. The psychological effects of the attacks caused people to cut back on their consumption of alcohol, which led to a decrease in traffic accidents.D. The increase in border security was a boon to some California farmers, who, as   Mexican and Canadian imports declined, sold so much marijuana that it became one of the states most valuable crops.Answers and ScoringQuestion 1B, Cable and satellite TV. Women with television were less willing to tolerate wife beating, less likely to admit to having a &#x201C;son preference,&#x201D; and more likely to exercise personal autonomy. Plus, the men were perhaps too busy watching cricket.Question 2A, Saturday nights are the most profitable. While Friday nights are the busiest, the single greatest determinant of a prostitute&#x2019;s price is the specific trick she is hired to perform. And for whatever reason, Saturday customers purchase more expensive services.Question 3C, One factor that doesn&#x2019;t seem to matter is whether a doctor is highly rated by his or her colleagues. Those named as best by their colleagues turned out to be no better than average at lowering death rates--although they did spend less money on treatments.Question 4C, Leukemia.  Chemotherapy has proven effective on some cancers, including leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin&#x2019;s disease, and testicular cancer, especially if these cancers are detected early. But in most cases, chemotherapy is remarkably ineffective, often showing zero discernible effect. That said, cancer drugs make up the second-largest category of pharmaceutical sales, with chemotherapy comprising the bulk.Question 5A, Inexpensive drugs. Expensive medical procedures, while technologically dazzling, are responsible for a remarkably small share of the improvement in heart disease. Roughly half of the decline has come from reductions in risk factors like high cholesterol and high blood pressure, both of which are treated with relatively inexpensive drugs. And much of the remaining decline is thanks to ridiculously inexpensive treatments like aspirin, heparin, ACE inhibitors, and beta-blockers.Question 6False. Based on extensive data analysis as well as crash tests paid for by the authors, old-fashioned seat belts do just as well as car seats.Question 7B, Shifting less than one day per week&#x2019;s worth of calories from red meat and dairy products to chicken, fish, eggs, or a vegetable-based diet achieves more greenhouse-gas reduction than buying all locally sourced food, according to a recent study by Christopher Weber and H. Scott Matthews, two Carnegie Mellon researchers.  Every time a Prius or other hybrid owner drives to the grocery store, she may be cancelling out its emissions-reducing benefit, at least if she shops in the meat section. Emission from cows, as well as sheep and other ruminants, are 25 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than the carbon dioxide released by cars and humans.Question 8C, the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines discharged more than 20 million tons of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere, which acted like a layer of sunscreen, reducing the amount of solar radiation and cooling off the earth by an average of one degree F.Question 9C, doctors not taking sanitary precautions.  This was the dawning age of the autopsy, and doctors did not yet know the importance of washing their hands after leaving the autopsy room and entering the delivery room.Question 10C, the psychological effect of the attacks caused people to increase their alcohol consumption, and traffic accidents increased as a result.Scoring32-40: Certified SuperFreak25-31: Freak--surprises lay in wait for you16-24: Wannabe freak--you&#x2019;ve got some reading to do1-15: Conventional wisdomer--you&#x2019;re still thinking in old ways",

Liv is dead and Aria's recovering from a disabling gunshot wound. Roar and Perry blame each other for Liv's death and it's tearing them apart. The magnetic Aether storms are getting worse. Before it's too late, they must find the Still Blue, a paradise where they can live safe from the storms. Sable, the ruthless and cruel Horn tribe leader, kidnaps Cinder to use his ability to generate an Aether to destroy the Aether currents. Perry, Aria, and the others determine to rescue Cinder, knowing that a showdown between rival tribe leaders Sable and Hess, the cowardly Dweller leader, is inevitable. Perry and Aria are strong yet imperfect characters struggling to balance their love for each other with their responsibilities as tribe leaders. Some of the book's most interesting characters, such as Liv and Cinder, aren't fully developed and are, sadly, short-lived. The inclusion of the identity of Aria's father, while not essential to the story, is a nice surprise. The humorous quips made by Roar and the 6, so welcome in the series' previous books, are largely missing here. The fact that Perry, Aria, and company are repeatedly captured by Sable does become a bit repetitive. Still, the forthright and compelling plot has just enough of a twist to make this book, and the series, stand out from others like it. Fans will be desperate to find out how it all ends.&#x2014;Sharon Rawlins, New Jersey State Library, Trenton",

        "B00005ULXN": "Sega's mascot made his 3-D debut on the Dreamcast, but with the demise  of that system the zippy blue hedgehog is popping up everywhere--including on  the GameCube. Unfortunately, his first next-gen appearance,Sonic Adventure  2: Battle, is marred by the same 3-D camera problems that plagued the  Dreamcast version, and the multiplayer \"battle\" component isn't all that it's  cracked up to be.Right out of the gate, players have the option of choosing Hero (Sonic, Tails,  and Knuckles) or Dark (Dr. Eggman, Shadow, and Rouge) quests, which are  completely different. Sonic and his dark counterpart Shadow traverse levels at  warp speed colleting coins and power-ups while fighting enemies in the game's  most exhilarating moments. Unfortunately, the other characters are nowhere near  as fun to play. Dr. Eggman and Tails fight through levels that require little  more than constant button-mashing to shoot an endless procession of enemies, and  Knuckles and Rouge participate in seemingly endless levels that require  searching for a variety of objects.Graphically, the game is a bit of a letdown considering the processing muscle of  GameCube. Models are fairly simplistic, and level textures are sometimes bland.  Game Boy Advance owners can use a link cable to download Chao from the game and  train them on the go, but the rewards for doing so are minor considering the  time investment involved. The main feature this game offers over its Dreamcast  predecessor is the variety of multiplayer modes, which are fun but offer none of  the depth or replayability of standalone multiplayer games likeSuper Smash  Bros. Melee. Still, they are nice additions--especially the racing  games--and round out a flawed single-player component. Sonic addicts who missed this  game the first time around on the Dreamcast will definitely want to check it  out, but the finicky camera, tedious non-Sonic/Shadow levels in single-player  mode, and surprisingly shallow multiplayer components (especially the Chao  games) turn what could have been a great game into a mere good one.--T.

        "0062294776": "A young woman must come to terms with the secret horror in her past to find love and happiness in this predictable new adult romance by the pseudonymous Lynn (Obsession author Jennifer L. Armentrout). After five hellish years of being called a lying whore in her small Texas town, 19-year-old Avery Morgansten is more than happy to leave for college in West Virginia. There she meets gorgeous, blue-eyed Cameron Hamilton, a fellow student who seems as attracted to her as she is to him. Haunted by her traumatic past, Avery is torn between protecting herself and finding love. The path to romance is long and rocky, and Cam has dark secrets of his own, but eventually both lovers come clean and all loose ends are neatly wrapped up. While Lynn's peripheral characters are fairly one-dimensional, Avery and Cam are compelling. Fans of stories about characters healed by love will find this one moderately satisfying.

        "0061374199": "Cheese Olamon, \"a six-foot-two, four-hundred-and-thirty-pound  yellow-haired Scandinavian who'd somehow arrived at the misconception he was black,\" is telling his old grammar school friends Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro why they have to convince another mutual chum, the gun dealer Bubba Rugowski, that Cheese didn't try to have him killed. \"You let Bubba know I'm clean when it comes to what happened to him. You want me alive. Okay? Without me, that girl will be gone. Gone-gone. You understand? Gone, baby, gone.\" Of all the chilling, completely credible scenes of sadness, destruction, and betrayal in Dennis Lehane's fourth and very possibly best book about Kenzie and Gennaro, this moment stands out because it captures in a few pages the essence of Lehane's success.Private detectives Kenzie and Gennaro, who live in the same working-class Dorchester neighborhood of Boston where they grew up, have gone to visit drug dealer Cheese in prison because they think he's involved in the kidnapping of 4-year-old Amanda McCready. Without sentimentalizing the grotesque figure of Cheese, Lehane tells us enough about his past to make us understand why he and the two detectives might share enough trust to possibly save a child's life when all the best efforts of traditional law enforcement have failed. By putting Kenzie and Gennaro just to one side of the law (but not totally outside; they have several cop friends, a very important part of the story), Lehane adds depth and edge to traditional genre relationships. The lifelong love affair between Kenzie and Gennaro--interrupted by her marriage to his best friend--is another perfectly controlled element that grows and changes as we watch. Surrounded by dead, abused, and missing children, Kenzie mourns and rages while Gennaro longs for one of her own. So the choices made by both of them in the final pages of this absolutely gripping story have the inevitability of life and the dazzling beauty of art.Other Kenzie/Gennaro books available in paperback:Darkness, Take My Hand,A Drink Before the War,Sacred.--Dick Adler--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

        "B00002CF9M": "InDiablo II, players return to a world of dark fantasy. As one of five distinct character types, players explore the world ofDiablo II, journey across distant lands, fight new villains, discover new treasures, and uncover ancient mysteries. Since the beginning of time, the forces of order and chaos have been engaged in an eternal struggle to decide the fate of all creation. That struggle has now come to the mortal realm, and neither man, demon, nor angel will be left unscathed. Diablo, lord of terror and youngest of the three prime evils, awakes from his long sleep beneath the dark earth. Setting in motion a grand scheme to free his exiled brothers, Mephisto and Baal, Diablo takes control of the small western kingdom of Khanduras. Working from deep within the ancient catacombs beneath the town of Tristram, Diablo grips the entire populace in a blanket of fear and paranoia. Ultimately, as even Khanduras's good King Leoric falls under Diablo's wicked power, a lone hero arises to challenge the darkness that engulfs the land. After plumbing the hellish depths of the labyrinth under Tristram, the nameless hero finally confronts the lord of terror himself. Knowing full well that Diablo's spirit can never be truly destroyed, the hero makes the noblest sacrifice of all--casting his soul and his very sanity aside, he takes the spirit of Diablo into himself, hoping that his own strength of will can contain the demon within. The hero doesn't realize that his selfless act will not only ensure Diablo's victory, but will also irrevocably damn his soul for all time.",
        "0060536357": "The leveraged buyout of the RJR Nabisco Corporation for $25 billion is a landmark in American business history, a story of avarice on an epic scale. Two versions of the fierce competition for the largest buyout ever consummated are presented by skilled journalists with contrasting styles. Burrough and Helyar are clearly fascinated with the personalities of the players in the deal and with the trappings of corporate wealth. The restless, flamboyant personality of Ross Johnson, CEO of RJR Nabisco, is portrayed as the key to the events that were to unfold. The colorful description of all of the players and the events will likely have broad appeal. Lampert signals the complexity of her story by introducing her narrative with a three-page cast of characters. Her focus on the strategy of the players and on the fast-paced action provides a more concise description of a deal big enough to augment the wealth of many rich people. Business libraries will want both versions of this story of capitalism drawn to the extreme, but students, looking for a more comprehensive treatment, will favor Lampert's version.- Joseph Barth, U.S. Military Acad.

He introduces Charles Benedict, a strikingly handsome and charismatic defense attorney and amateur magician who appears to be the novel's leading man. But Benedict is swiftly exposed as an extremely effective homicidal sociopath, and the book shifts to its true protagonist, private sleuth Dana Cutler, who is quickly dispatched on a convoluted cross-country search for a bejeweled golden scepter with a history curiously similar to that of Sam Spade's famous Maltese Falcon. It's a given that this quest will eventually bring the shrewd detective in contact with the homicidal Benedict. Jonathan Davis's narration is smooth and well paced. He adds just the right amount of smarm and smirk to Benedict's speech and captures all of Dana's drive, determination, and fearlessness. The book's other characters have more than their share of accents&mdash;from the mysterious Frenchwoman who sends Dana after the scepter to a surprisingly cheery Russian mob boss.

Beautiful Annabelle Peyton represents Old World aristocracy; she's genteel but impoverished and desperately trying to maintain the appearance of wealth. Commoner Simon Hunt, on the other hand, is a brash, ambitious entrepreneur who has made a fortune investing in industry and railroads and is only marginally accepted by society. As Annabelle attempts to trap a moneyed aristocrat into marriage&mdash;with the help of her vivacious fellow Wallflowers, of course&mdash;Simon boldly pursues her, first with the desire to make her his mistress and then with far more noble intentions. The scenes involving Annabelle and the three other Wallflowers&mdash;two impudent American girls and a shy, stuttering English heiress&mdash;are almost as enjoyable as the ones in which Annabelle and Simon try to outmaneuver each other. The protagonists inevitably wind up at the altar, but their story doesn't end there. Kleypas delves deeper, touching on Annabelle's changing mindset (specifically, her growing admiration of Simon's working-class roots and her acceptance of everything he stands for) and Simon's insecurity over taking her away from polite society. By turns amusing, sensual and sober, but always compelling, this is a first-rate offering from a truly talented storyteller.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Tiberium, the mysterious, alien crystalline structure that infested Earth for decades and caused years of relentless conflict between the Global Defense Initiative and the Brotherhood of Nod, was close to rendering the planet uninhabitable. In the midst of this crisis, Kane, Nod's prophetic leader, emerged from seclusion to deliver GDI the message that he had developed a system that could control Tiberium and harness its power. But he could not build this \"Tiberium Control Network\" without GDI's cooperation. Thus, the two opposing factions&mdash;GDI and Nod&mdash;found themselves in a desperate and unlikely alliance to stop Tiberium from extinguishing mankind.Now, after 15 years, the network is nearly complete. Tiberium is under strict control and the revitalized Earth is on the cusp of a new age of prosperity and progress. It is only now that the world's citizens begin to seriously ponder why Kane chose to help, and what he will want in return. Kane. GDI. Nod. Tiberium. How will it end? These questions and more lead to the dramatic final act of the 15-year Tiberium saga inCommand &amp; Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight.GameplayCommand &amp; Conqueris a real-time strategy gaming franchise, andCommand &amp; Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilightis no exception. Players assume color-coated versions of the GDI or Nod factions and uncover segments of the map, where they must manage Tiberium and other resources in their possession or that they they mine or commandeer in the field. Other factions occur in the game, but are not playable, and different single player campaigns are available to players depending on which of the two factions are chosen. The energy that Tiberium crystals possess is used in the manufacture and upgrading of mining and combat units, weapons and support infrastructure in preparation for impending conflicts with other players on the same map that are doing the same. Each faction has its own distinct unit types, both land and air based, which although unique, are overall more or less balanced against those of opposing faction. In addition, certain units can be captured on the battlefield and used to supplement your arsenal. The overarching task though is to combine the right number and type of units with the right battlefield strategy for the conflict and terrain at hand.Historically,C&amp;Cmatches have been won by completely eliminating all enemy units that stand against you. Although there is certainly plenty of this withinTiberian Twilight, the game also is different in that players need not eliminate all enemy units, instead capturing control nodes throughout the game and holding them for a minimum amount of time. Doing so leads to earning enough points to win the match.Tiberian Twilightalso differs from earlier games in the series with the addition of certain RPG game elements. Players overall orientation within their chosen faction is class based, with units falling generally in offensive, defensive or support classes depending on your play style. These units can be upgraded with experience points, which are gained through success against enemy units, with more advanced enemy units earning the conquering player more points, and thus potential unit upgrade opportunity.5-on-5 Online MultiplayerCommand &amp; Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilightallows PC gamers to team up and battle like never before.

A steroid devotee since the age of 20, Canseco goes beyond admitting his own usage to claim that with the tacit approval of the league's powers-that-be he acted as baseball's ambassador of steroids and is therefore indirectly responsible for \"saving\" the game.Chief among his claims is that he introduced Mark McGwire to steroids in 1988 and that he often injected McGwire while they were teammates. According to Canseco, steroids and human growth hormones gave McGwire and Sammy Sosa (whose own usage was \"so obvious, it was a joke\") the strength, stamina, regenerative ability, and confidence they needed for a record-setting home run duel often credited with restoring baseball's popularity after the 1994 strike. Although he devotes a lot of ink to McGwire, Canseco envisions himself as a kind of Johnny Steroidseed, spreading the gospel of performance enhancement, naming a number of players that he either personally introduced to steroids or is relatively certain he can identify as fellow users. Because Canseco plays fast and loose with some of the facts of his own career he provides fodder for those looking to damage his credibility, but in many ways questions of public and personal perception are what raise the book beyond mere vitriolic tell-all. Those willing to heed his request and truly listen to what he has to say will findJuicedto be an occasionally insightful meditation on the workings of public perception and a consistently interesting character study.--Shane Farmer",

Armed only with an oversized purple crayon, young Harold draws himself a landscape full of beauty and excitement. But this is no hare-brained, impulsive flight of fantasy. Cherubic, round-headed Harold conducts his adventure with the utmost prudence, letting his imagination run free, but keeping his wits about him all the while. He takes the necessary purple-crayon precautions: drawing landmarks to ensure he won't get lost; sketching a boat when he finds himself in deep water; and creating a purple pie picnic when he feels the first pangs of hunger.Crockett Johnson's understated tribute to the imagination was first published in 1955, and has been inspiring readers of all ages ever since.

She is on the swim team, wants to attend a summer writing program in New York, has applied to Brown, and is the last of her girlfriends to still have her virginity. When the rakish Sebastian Kydd returns to town, all the girls in the school become distracted, but he seems to have his eye on Carrie, at least until her best friend begins to take notice of him. The action is lightweight: senior pranks are played, dates are prevalent, friendships are tested, and Carrie keeps letting boys run rampant over her. It takes most of the book for her to stand up for herself. This protagonist is clearly written to resemble her older self as portrayed in the TV seriesSex and the City. She spends the novel questioning relationships; worrying about friendships; developing a funky, independent sense of fashion; flirting with boys while dating two at once; and having a gay male friend. The author is known for writing frivolous, adult chick-lit books and she does not stray from that style here. While toning down the antics that take place in her adult books, she still writes about partying, drinking, smoking (cigarettes and dope), sex, and shoplifting, making this book best suited to older teens looking for a diversion.&mdash;Geri Diorio, The Ridgefield Library, CTCopyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "B00005BW7Q": "The ambitiously namedXenosaga: Episode 1--Der Wille zer Machtis an epic-sized space opera that opens in the outer reaches of the galaxy. The story follows several space-dwelling citizens as they aim to unlock the secrets of the universe. The specifics of those secrets presumably will be revealed over subsequent editions of the Xenosaga series (after all, this is onlyEpisode 1)--but a vital clue is held in the elusive Zohar, a mysterious artifact that is aggressively sought by evil aliens. Without spoiling the plot's surprising twists, let's just say the game's German subtitle \"Der Wille zur Macht\" (translated as \"The Will to Power\") is a less-than-subtle ode to German philosopherFriedrich Nietzsche, who is considered as one of the precursors of existentialism.Like many conventional RPG titles,Xenosaga's gameplay balances between exploration and battle modes. The game designers have thankfully spared players from any ill-conceived random battle sequences. Instead, you can concentrate directly on your quest without the repetitious enemy battles.The designers also did a good job balancing a traditional RPG structure with complex themes. However, the game seems to go out of its way to casually integrate controversial (and frankly creepy) religious imagery into the context of the game. Some may find the game offensive and disturbing; others will likely find it intellectually stimulating.Namco promises about 80 hours of gaming--but a good portion of that is non-interactive full-motion video. While the stretched-out cutscenes do add considerable depth to the characters, they're often poorly paced and too long--one takes an alarming 30 minutes to unfold! The addition of more background music might have helped to pick up the pacing, since the obligatory soundtrack is strangely absent at some critical plot points.With impressive animation and unexpected plot points,Xenosaga: Episode 1--Der Wille zer Machtis easily one of the more enjoyable RPG titles to hit the PS2. While this isn't for the happy-go-lucky gaming crowd (seeKingdom Hearts), adult-minded gamers will likely be consumed by the darkness and devious delights offered within this twisted title.--Brett AtwoodPros:Complex characters and story themesNo random battle sequencesImpressive 3-D animationCons:Long, long, looooooooong cut scenes",

The second and more terrible is that his beloved Beatrice has been murdered, and her soul pulled down into hell by a dark force. Vowing not to accept the damnation of either souls, he gives chase, vows to get Beatrice back and descends into the infamous nine circles of hell.

The conclusions Schwartz draws will be familiar to anyone who has flipped through 900 eerily similar channels of cable television only to find that nothing good is on. Whether choosing a health-care plan, choosing a college class or even buying a pair of jeans, Schwartz, drawing extensively on his own work in the social sciences, shows that a bewildering array of choices floods our exhausted brains, ultimately restricting instead of freeing us. We normally assume in America that more options (\"easy fit\" or \"relaxed fit\"?) will make us happier, but Schwartz shows the opposite is true, arguing that having all these choices actually goes so far as to erode our psychological well-being. Part research summary, part introductory social sciences tutorial, part self-help guide, this book offers concrete steps on how to reduce stress in decision making. Some will find Schwartz's conclusions too obvious, and others may disagree with his points or find them too repetitive, but to the average lay reader, Schwartz's accessible style and helpful tone is likely to aid the quietly desperate.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Although the Arkham asylum is well fortified, he has a nagging feeling that all is not well, which proves to be the case when seconds after turning The Joker over to the guards, the master criminal breaks free of his captors. Even more surprising than this quick turn of events is the revelation that it was never The Joker's intent to escape the vault-like facility, but instead to trap Batman there. Surrounded by an asylum full of dangerous criminals, many of which he put there and all at the beck and call of the Joker, can Batman survive and discover what is behind the Joker's intricate plot?GameplayInBatman: Arkham Asylumplayers strap on the gadget-heavy utility belt of the Caped Crusader. Gameplay here is a combination of both the knuckle crunching rush of hand to hand combat as you take on the hordes of thugs that infest Arkham Asylum, and stealth gameplay in which you must dispatch individuals from the shadows. Players can expect an engrossing single player campaign in which Batman continually moves forward to face the henchmen, bosses and traps that The Joker has set for him. With regards to opponents, in addition to The Joker who you will hear more than you see, the dark walls of Arkham also hold familiar villains from the the Batman criminal universe including Harley Quinn, Victor Zsasz and Killer Croc, that you will have to deal with, but don't expect a one-dimensional experience. As players progress from environment to environment within Arkham they will have to use varying combinations of muscle, detective skills, gadgetry and a certain degree of light RPG-like leveling of Batman's skills, arsenal and physical characteristics to survive and discover what The Joker's underlying scheme is.In addition to the story-driven single player campaignArkham Asylumalso contains various additional play modes. These include an arcade styled combat mode where players accumulate points by engaging hordes of thugs in a hand to hand slugfest across a series of maps, in which Batman's physical strength and agility play a major role. The key here is to chain together as many attacks as possible due to the fact that with each successful combo players increase the point multiplier associated with their actions. The game also features a time-based stealth mode where players must hone their ability to strike silently from the shadows. This gameplay, referred to as 'Invisible Predator' utilizes the Dark Knight's skill with gadgets like the grapple tool, batarang and explosives. These allow for vertical/horizontal mobility, the ability to quickly strike from above and at a distance and to take out enemies and create distractions, even through walls. But remember that Batman works solo and is not superhuman. Your enemies will congregate around trouble areas and work as a team against you, so you must be silent, plan your attacks wisely, strike quickly and discover the value of encouraging fear within enemies.Key FeaturesUtilize the unique FreeFlow combat system to chain together unlimited combos seamlessly and battle with huge groups of The Joker's henchmen in brutal melee brawls.Investigate as Batman, the world's greatest detective, by solving intricate puzzles with the help of cutting edge forensic tools including x-ray scanning, fingerprint scans, 'Amido Black' spray and a pheromone tracker.Face off against Gotham's greatest villains including The Joker, Harley Quinn, Victor Zsasz and Killer Croc.Become the Invisible Predator with Batman's fear takedowns and unique vantage point system to move without being seen and hunt enemies.Choose multiple takedown methods, including swooping from the sky and smashing through walls, and use the predator camera get a closer look at the action.Explore every inch of Arkham Asylum and roam freely on the infamous island, presented for the first time ever in its gritty and realistic entirety.Experience what it's like to be Batman using batarangs, explosive gel aerosol, the Batclaw, sonar resonator and the line launcher.Unlock more secrets by completing hidden challenges in the world and develop and customize equipment by earning experience points.Enjoy complete superhero freedom in the environment with the use of Batman's grapple to get to any place you can see, jump from any height and glide in any direction.PlayStation 3 exclusive Joker Challenge Map DLC.",

Cornelia and her husband, Teo, move to suburban Philadelphia, where she finds it difficult to fit into the sorority-like atmosphere. Despite a bevy of domestic dramas (planning a family among them), Cornelia's first-person chapters are the quietest of the three points of view. Seemingly shallow and vicious, neighbor Piper shows her kinder side as she struggles through her best friend's fight against cancer. Though the extreme of Piper's two-facedness isn't convincing, her moments of sincerity invite genuine empathy. Cornelia also yields narrative time to Dev, a precocious teenager whose father is missing and whose mother develops a friendship with Cornelia. Dev's connection to the story is initially unclear, though he does grow close to Clare, a troubled teenager with an unconventional connection to Cornelia, and a late-breaking development grounds his role more firmly. Though each story line is a good read on its own, they don't always braid nicely, and while the predictable plot wanders into sappiness, the prose is polished and the suburban travails are familiar enough that fans of the women's fiction and higher-brow mommy lit will relate.(May)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

And then I realised that moving Vimes out of his city element and away from his comfort zone was going to be a sheer treat to write.Gaiman:The Watch fascinate me. You get to do hardboiled police procedurals while still writing funny smart books set in a fantastic world.Pratchett:On a point of order, Mister Gaiman, the world in which Sam Vimes finds himself is hardly fantastic. Okay, there are goblins, but the overall ambience is that of the shires of Middle England. It&rsquo;s all about the commonality of humankind. Shove Sam Vimes into a situation that has gone toxic and away he goes, as realistic as any other policeman and thinking in the very same ways and being Sam Vimes, questioning his motives and procedures all the way through.Gaiman:Did you really say in a previous interview that you&rsquo;d like to be like Sam Vines?

The author can always delve into his own personality and find aspects of himself with which he can dress his characters.

It's necessary, in fact, when attempting contemporary satire. Sharp-edged humor relies on topical reference points... Unfortunately for novelists, real life is getting way too funny and far-fetched.&rdquo;  Does the Discworld as a setting allow you to escape from that? Or is it a tool that lets you raid the headlines in ways people might not expect?Pratchett:I think that&rsquo;s the commonality of humankind again. I hope that everyone in Discworld is a recognisable and understandable character and so sometimes I can present them with modern and contemporary problems, such as Mustrum Ridcully getting his head around homosexuality.In truth, I never have to go looking for this stuff; I turn to find it smacking me in the face. I was very pleased whenMaking Moneycame out just before the banking crisis and everyone said I had predicted it. It was hardly difficult.Gaiman:How has the Discworld changed over the years?Pratchett:I suppose the simple answer is that there is still humour, but the gags are no longer set up; they are derived from characters&rsquo; personalities and situations. These days the humour seems to arrive of its own accord.Gaiman:How has writing the Discworld novels changed how you see the world?Pratchett:I think it more true that getting older changes how you see the world. There is stuff inSnuff, for example, that I couldn&rsquo;t have written at 25. Although I had written things before Discworld, I really leaned writing, on the job as it were, on Discworld. I think that the books are, if not serious, dealing with more serious subjects. These days it&rsquo;s not just for laughs. My world view had changed; sometimes I feel that the world is made up of sensible people who know that plot and bloody idiots who don&rsquo;t. Of course, all Discworld fans know the plot by heart!Gaiman:How has writing the Discworld novels changed how the world sees you?Pratchett:Has it? My agent pointed out one day that I had been quoted by a columnist in some American newspaper, and he noted with some glee that they simply identified me by name without reminding people who I was, apparently in the clear expectation that their readers would know who I am. I have quite a large number of honorary doctorates; I am a professor of English at Trinity College Dublin and a fellow of King&rsquo;s College London, on top of all the other stuff, including the knighthood. However, when it gets to the sub-editors I am always going to be that writer of wacky fantasy, though I have to say that dismissiveness is getting rarer and rarer.Gaiman:Are you respectable?Pratchett:Is this a trick question? If so, then I shall say yes. Generally speaking I try to obey the law, pay my taxes (of which there are an enormous lot), give to charity, and write letters to theTimesthat they print.It&rsquo;s a weird term, respectable; isn&rsquo;t &lsquo;respek&rsquo; what every street kid wants and might possibly expect at the point of a knife? I certainly get involved with things and shortly after finishing this interview will be annoying my local MP. It&rsquo;s fun. Discworld and the Alzheimer&rsquo;s together have given me a platform.",

At times I felt I was reading of some foreign or forgotten city, a moody and crumbling place in the shadow of Manhattan. While the damaged-goods characters are quite memorable--a woman spends her days &ldquo;speaking&rdquo; to her dead husband; a music teacher drinks to oblivion, haunted by his dead mother; an immigrant shop owner dreams of a better Red Hook--the star here is &ldquo;the Hook.&rdquo; One character describes it as &ldquo;a neighborhood of ghosts,&rdquo; where trash rolls like tumbleweed--hazy, smelly, noisy, blue collar, crime-ridden, yet full of heart and hope. Says one character, who wants to flee Red Hook in the boat his murdered father left him: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not such a bad place &hellip; if you look under the surface.&rdquo; The same can be said ofVisitation Street, a deceptively literary tale that brings to mind its benefactor, Denis Lehane, who published the book under his new imprint.  --Neal Thompson",

This time the lord of legal thrillers dives deep into the world of the homeless, particularly their barely audible legal voice in a world dominated by large, all-powerful law firms. Our hero, Michael Brock, is on the fast track to partnership at D.C.'s premier law firm, Sweeny & Drake. His dream of someday raking in a million-plus a year is finally within reach. Nothing can stop him, not even 90-hour workweeks and a failing marriage--until he meets DeVon Hardy, a.k.a.  &quot;Mister,&quot; a Vietnam vet with a grudge against his landlord--and a few lawyers to fry. Hardy, with no clear motive, takes Brock and eight of his colleagues hostage in a boardroom, demanding their tax returns and interrogating them with a conviction that would have put perpetrators of the Spanish Inquisition to shame. Hardy, a man of few words and a lot of ammunition, mumbles cryptically, &quot;Who are the evictors?&quot; as he points a .44 automatic within inches of Brock's face. The violent outcome of the hostage situation triggers an abrupt soul-searching for the young lawyer, and Hardy's mysterious question continues to haunt him. Brock learns that Hardy had been in and out of homeless shelters most of his life, but he had recently begun paying rent in a rundown building; that means he has legal recourse when a big money-making outfit such as Sweeny & Drake boots him with no warning. When Brock realizes that his profession caters to the morally challenged, he sets out on an aimless search through the dicier side of D.C., ending up at the 14th Street Legal Clinic. The clinic's director, a gargantuan man named Mordecai Green, woos Brock to the clinic with a $90,000 cut in pay and the chance to redeem his soul. Brock takes it--and some of the story's credibility along with it; it's hard to believe that a Yale graduate who sacrificed everything--including his marriage--to succeed in the legal profession would quickly jump at the opportunity for low-paying, charitable work. However, Brock's search for corruption in the swanky upper echelons of Sweeny & Drake (via the toughest streets of D.C.) is filled with colorful characters and realistic, gritty descriptions. In theThe Street Lawyer, Grisham once again defends the voiceless and powerless. In the words of Mordecai Green, &quot;That's justice, Michael. That's what street law is all about.

According to Rareware, there are over 30 different animation routines that come into play, depending on where the soldier is hit.

        "0062291408": "*Starred Review* In her last novel, Maya&#x2019;s Notebook (2013), Allende illuminated a criminal underworld. Now she nimbly joins her detective novelist husband, William C. Gordon, in writing crime fiction. Given her signature combination of bewitching imagination and social gravitas, Allende creates a compassionate and gripping mystery stoked by the paradoxes of family and community and the consequences of abuse. Super-smart high-school senior Amanda Mart&#xED;n is obsessed with an Internet role-playing game, Ripper (as in Jack), and oversees a group comprising four other brilliant misfit teens from around the world as well as her grandfather, who raised her after her very young parents divorced. Amanda&#x2019;s father, Bob, is a deputy chief of homicide in the San Francisco police department. Her mother, Indiana, is a healer too kind for her own good who is romantically entangled with a former navy SEAL and a wealthy dilettante. As Amanda and her cyber-brigade investigate a series of ritualistic murders no one else believes are connected, Allende richly portrays a range of intriguing characters, from Ayani, a famous Ethiopian model and women&#x2019;s rights activist, to Attila, a heroic war dog. Sensitive to inequality, injustice, and psychological complexity and touching on everything from aromatherapy to illegal immigrants to PTSD, Allende&#x2019;s tightly plotted tale of crimes obvious and masked is sharply perceptive, utterly charming, and intensely suspenseful.HIGH-DEMAND BACK STORY: Best-selling Allende&#x2019;s leap into crime fiction will be energetically promoted with a national author tour and a publicity blitz directed at both her fans and mystery enthusiasts. --Donna Seaman",

        "B00009WAUK": "You can almost hear the collective drooling of RPG and Game Boy fans worldwide. As the inaugural Nintendo/Square reunion title,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancehas a lot to live up to--and it does, spectacularly!The long heralded Final Fantasy series has enjoyed a number of spin-offs and sequels. Using the familiar character types and classes of the Final Fantasy series, but with a wholly original storyline,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancecreates an immersive world of strategic combat and conquest.Snow JobWhile most fantasy games favor romantic landscapes,Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceslyly starts out in a plain-vanilla suburb. Players assume the role of young Marche Radiuju in the humble burg of St. Ivalice.A snowball fight introduces the characters and sets the groundwork for future battles. After a brief (but chilly) skirmish, Marche heads home to visit his younger brother.Marche MadnessSoon after, Marche's friends drop by to show him an ancient book of mysterious origins. After failing to translate the text properly, Marche's friends leave for the evening. After a wistful slumber, Marche awakens and realizes he isn't in Ivalice anymore... or is he?Alone in a foreign land, Marche quickly comes under the care of a helpful creature known as a Moogle. It doesn't take much to convince Marche to adopt a lucrative career as a mercenary.Gangs of IvaliceA quick stop at the town inn introduces Marche to his new gang. A motley crew at best, your associates include low-level monks, mages, archers, and soldiers. The only hope you have of finding your way home is to turn your ragtag group of misfits into a finely tuned fighting force.Begin your tour of duty by chatting up the local barkeep. He'll clue you in to interesting news bits, rumors, and job opportunities. Due to your severe lack of experience, early quests are little more than errands.As you gain experience and reputation, your job options grow as well as the rewards. You can also send one of your crew members on side missions for extra swag. You cannot use these members in your regular quests until they return from their mission.Rules of EngagementWhether your quest is to fetch rare herbs or escort the local nobleman, you can always expect bad company. The battlefield is set up from an isometric 3D viewpoint, allowing clear view of every character in play.At the start of a match, you must choose which members of your gang you wish to take into battle with you. You have a clear view of the enemies before choosing, so try to match your lineup to your opposition.Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceintroduces an innovative law system to the series. During every battle, an impartial judge decrees specific rules, such as banning poison attacks or physical attacks. The judges' unpredictability requires players to keep a well-rounded group of characters at all times.Technically, you can break the combat laws, but it is generally not recommended. Even if you win the battle, any of your characters who breaks a law is whisked away to prison. They can only be released after paying a hefty fine.Fantasy FightingThe battlefield is set up like a 3D chessboard, with elevations and terrain types. In each turn, a character can move a specific number of spaces and perform a single action, such as attack or using an item.Most strategy games employ either real-time or turn-based action.Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceemploys a speed-based system that is somewhere in-between.Characters still take turns to move and perform actions, but these are based on each character's individual speed ratings. Nimble characters like rogues and ninjas are usually the first characters to go and can usually move farther than other characters. The downside is that faster characters typically lack strong armor and health stats.Subtle details such as terrain type and attack proximity can have a direct affect on your ability to hit an enemy. Attacking an enemy from behind or the side will yield much higher hit percentages than head-on attacks.Job FairWhat you do off the battlefield is arguably more important than what you do on it. Thanks to a stable economy, your characters can usually change job classes once they gain enough experience.Need a little more magic in your life? Try turning one of your grunts into a mage. There are more than 30 different job classes available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.Even in far-off fantasy lands, commercialism is a way of life. You'll be amazed at how quickly you'll end up spending your hard-earned greenbacks on shiny new stuff. Weapons and armor serve not only to boost your stats, but also grant special abilities to specific character types and species.While one sword might grant tremendous attack points, a seemingly lesser sword may give its wielder access to a special attack that can tip the scales in your favor. Thanks to the law system, one should never get too attached to a single piece of equipment.Face ValueGorgeous character illustrations and 2D sprites harken back to Square's 16-bit glory days. Each of the shops, inns, towns, and fields is superbly detailed, with subtle background animations.Final Fantasy Tactics Advancemaintains the series' stellar rep for technically and visually brilliant summon attacks.Uniquely,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancefeatures three separate display settings, depending on whether you're playing on the Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Advance SP, or the Game Boy Player. Each setting offers different levels of brightness, contrast, and saturation to appease even the most fickle of gamers.The only thing that can rival the on-screen wonders is the audio candy. It is no surprise why Square Enix's soundtracks are the most sought-after in the video game community.Lasting PowerNeedless to say, there are hours upon hours of gameplay packed into this tiny little cartridge. Square Enix has done a tremendous job in creating an easily accessible yet incredibly deep gameplay experience. Plug into one of the finest strategy RPG experiences ever created withFinal Fantasy Tactics Advance.",

Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon.

One bundle is titledThings I Know Are Trueand the other,Things I Must Not Forget. The author? That would be the protagonist's mother, LuLing, who has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. In these documents the elderly matriarch, born in China in 1916, has set down a record of her birth and family history, determined to keep the facts from vanishing as her mind deteriorates.A San Francisco career woman who makes her living by ghostwriting self-help books, Ruth has little idea of her mother's past or true identity. What's more, their relationship has tended to be an angry one. Still, Ruth recognizes the onset of LuLing's decline--along with her own remorse over past rancor--and hires a translator to decipher the packets. She also resolves to \"ask her mother to tell her about her life. For once, she would ask. She would listen. She would sit down and not be in a hurry or have anything else to do.\"Framed at either end by Ruth's chapters, the central portion ofThe Bonesetter's Daughtertakes place in China in the remote, mountainous region where anthropologists discovered Peking Man in the 1920s. Here superstition and tradition rule over a succession of tiny villages. And here LuLing grows up under the watchful eye of her hideously scarred nursemaid, Precious Auntie. As she makes clear, it's not an enviable setting:I noticed the ripe stench of a pig pasture, the pockmarked land dug up by dragon-bone dream-seekers, the holes in the walls, the mud by the wells, the dustiness of the unpaved roads. I saw how all the women we passed, young and old, had the same bland face, sleepy eyes that were mirrors of their sleepy minds.Nor is rural isolation the worst of it. LuLing's family, a clan of ink makers, believes itself cursed by its connection to a local doctor, who cooks up his potions and remedies from human bones. And indeed, a great deal of bad luck befalls the narrator and her sister GaoLing before they can finally engineer their escape from China. Along the way, familial squabbles erupt around every corner, particularly among mothers, daughters, and sisters. And as she did in her earlierThe Joy Luck Club, Amy Tan uses these conflicts to explore the intricate dynamic that exists between first-generation Americans and their immigrant elders.--Victoria Jenkins--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

Drew assures Alice that the owner will be hands off, allowing her to run the gallery on her own. Her friends think it sounds too good to be true, but Alice sees a perfect opportunity to make a name for herself beyond the shadow of her famous father, an award-winning and controversial film maker.Everything is perfect until the morning Alice arrives at work to find the gallery gone&mdash;the space stripped bare as if it had never existed&mdash;and Drew Campbell&rsquo;s dead body on the floor. Overnight, Alice&rsquo;s dream job has vanished, and she finds herself at the center of police attention with nothing to prove her innocence. The phone number Drew gave her links back to a disposable phone.The artist whose work she displayed doesn&rsquo;t seem to exist. And the dead man she claims is Drew has been identified as someone else.When police discover ties between the gallery and a missing girl, Alice knows she&rsquo;s been set up. Now she has to prove it&mdash;a dangerous search for answers that will entangle her in a dark, high-tech criminal conspiracy and force her to unearth long-hidden secrets involving her own family&hellip; secrets that could cost Alice her life.Amazon Exclusive: Michael Connelly ReviewsLong GoneMichael Connelly&rsquo;s Edgar Award-winning first novel,The Black Echo, was published in 1992 and based in part on a true crime that had occurred in Los Angeles. Since then he has written more than 18 novels, the most recent of which isThe Fifth Witness.You know how the song goes--&ldquo;If I can make it here, I&rsquo;ll make it anywhere.&rdquo; The anthem for a city and a state of mind, powered by the voice of its own son, Frank Sinatra, even if technically he came from across the river.New York, New York. It is truly the first song on the soundtrack of the city. And it points up the risk and reward of living in the greatest city in the world.Well, what about the risks and rewards in writing a novel about the greatest city in the world? To me the challenge would be intimidating, even daunting, before I got the first word down on the first page. But not to Alafair Burke. WithLong Goneshe makes the city her own. She takes New York with a knowing and confident hand, folding its teeming streets into character and plot in a story that is never less than gripping.At center you have Alice Humphrey. She is the daughter of privilege in a city that doesn&rsquo;t pay much mind to that privilege. She&rsquo;s on her own and that is the beating heart of this book. Alice on her own. Burke constructs this book with the precision of a watchmaker. It is a contraption piece that closes tightly around Alice and then we are with her as she investigates the set up and finds her way to safety.I am familiar with most of Burke&rsquo;s work and I think Alice is her best heroine yet. She connects with us on so many levels. She is an everywoman cornered by forces she doesn&rsquo;t recognize or understand in a city with too many back alleys and secrets to ever know.  She is from a family that holds secrets from her as well as the world. But no matter. She is relentless in her pursuit of the truth, whichever way it is finally told. And in that we connect to her, admire her, like her. We feel for Alice Humphrey and want to be there when she sees it all through.That is the writer&rsquo;s most difficult task, building the bridge of empathy between reader and protagonist. Burke does it here with a character who is persistent in simply refusing to be a victim. Don&rsquo;t we all wish we were the same.Though any writer will flat out tell you that the easier it looks the harder it is to get on the page, Alafair Burke makes this one look like a walk in the park. Frank Sinatra would certainly be proud. Start spreading the news.",

Grisham's story revolves around a typical middle-aged American couple, Luther and Nora Krank. On the first Sunday after Thanksgiving they wave their daughter Blair off to Peru to work for the Peace Corps, and they suddenly realize that \"for the first time in her young and sheltered life Blair would spend Christmas away from home.\"Luther Krank sees his daughter's Christmas absence as an opportunity. He estimates that \"a year earlier, the Luther Krank family had spent $6,100 on Christmas,\" and have \"precious little to show for it.\" So he makes an executive decision, telling his wife, friends, and neighbors that \"we won't do Christmas.\" Instead, Luther books a 10-day Caribbean cruise. But things start to turn nasty when horrified neighbors get wind of the Krank's subversive scheme and besiege the couple with questions about their decision.Grisham builds up a funny but increasingly terrifying picture of how this  tight-knit community turns on the Kranks, who find themselves under increasing pressure to conform.

        "0061702587": "Product DescriptionBlending history and anecdote, geography and reminiscence, science and exposition, theNew York Timesbestselling author ofKrakatoatells the breathtaking saga of the magnificent Atlantic Ocean, setting it against the backdrop of mankind's intellectual evolution.Until a thousand years ago, no humans ventured into the Atlantic or imagined traversing its vast infinity. But once the first daring mariners successfully navigated to far shores&#x2014;whether it was the Vikings, the Irish, the Chinese, Christopher Columbus in the north, or the Portuguese and the Spanish in the south&#x2014;the Atlantic evolved in the world's growing consciousness of itself as an enclosed body of water bounded by the Americas to the West, and by Europe and Africa to the East.Atlanticis a biography of this immense space, of a sea which has defined and determined so much about the lives of the millions who live beside or near its tens of thousands of miles of coast.The Atlantic has been central to the ambitions of explorers, scientists and warriors, and it continues to affect our character, attitudes, and dreams. Poets to potentates, seers to sailors, fishermen to foresters&#x2014;all have a relationship with this great body of blue-green sea and regard her as friend or foe, adversary or ally, depending on circumstance or fortune. Simon Winchester chronicles that relationship, making the Atlantic come vividly alive. Spanning from the earth's geological origins to the age of exploration, World War II battles to modern pollution, his narrative is epic and awe-inspiring.A Q&amp;A with Author Simon WinchesterQ:Writing a &#x201C;biography&#x201D; of a massive subject like the Atlantic Ocean is audacious and seemingly daunting. What inspired you to write the book, how long did it take you, and what did your research entail?Winchester:It occurred to me one afternoon while, for the umpteenth time, I was crossing &#x2018;the pond&#x2019; on a flight between London and New York, that we took the waters below us far too much for granted. I thought back to the first crossing I had ever made, back in 1963, on a ship&#x2014;and the romance of the ocean as I saw it then&#x2014;and I decided that it could be very interesting to look into the role the Atlantic has played in humankind&#x2019;s history. I spent the next eighteen months travelling, going everywhere from the Faroes and Iceland in the north, to Tristan da Cunha and Patagonia in the south. The book itself took eight months to write, four to edit.Q:What was the most unusual or fascinating fact you discovered while researching and writingAtlantic?Winchester:I remain intrigued by the thought that the State of Israel was in effect born as a result of a lack of cordite in the Royal Navy&#x2019;s ammunition stores during the Battle of the Atlantic in 1916.  A White Russian biologist, Chaim Weizmann, at the time a professor at the University of Manchester, worked out how to solve this problem, and when the British government of the time offered to reward him for his game-changing invention, he declined&#x2014;asking only for Arthur Balfour to make his famous Declaration of 1917, which led to the formation of Israel.Q:Why is the Atlantic significant in the development of Western civilization? Is there one important thing about the ocean we should know but do not?Winchester:The first true parliamentary democracy was founded in the Atlantic, in Iceland in the tenth century&#x2014;and the concept spread rapidly through northern Europe. It was then followed in short order by the establishment of a similarly organized network of traders and trade routes, the so-called Hanseatic leaguers. That two such crucial aspects of modern human civilization&#x2014;government and trade&#x2014;are based still today on principles laid down beside the Atlantic Ocean is a fact little remembered by most &#x2014;and when I found the story out, it astonished and delighted me.Q:You are a sailor yourself. Have you sailed the Atlantic? What was the experience like?Winchester:I have sailed the entire Indian Ocean; and I have sailed a little in the South Atlantic&#x2014;undertaking the voyage in a tiny (30ft) steel gaff-rigged schooner.  But while I had few major problems sailing between the coasts of India and South Africa, once I had &#x2018;rounded the bend&#x2019;, as it were, and passed into the Atlantic, everything changed: the sea became very rough and (a particular problem in a steel yacht) very cold.  And so I abandoned the Atlantic attempt&#x2014;a decision that gives me ever greater respect today for the ocean itself, and for those sailors who are brave and determined enough to sail it. (In my defense&#x2014;since 16 year olds now make the journey&#x2014;I should point out that I went out without radio or radar, and with only a sextant as a navigation aid. GPS and e-mail make modern yachting a somewhat less arduous business. But the inescapable fact that I wiped out troubles me still. A bit.)Q:How do today&#x2019;s giant cruise ships compare to their predecessors like the Queen Mary or the Titanic? Have we lost something fundamental in how we experience the ocean with modernization?Winchester:I detest the big cruise ships of today, immense Vegas style monstrosities filled with amusements specifically designed&#x2014;or so it seems&#x2014;utterly to detach the passenger from the realities of the ocean he is crossing (and to make even more money for the shipowners, of course). One surely goes to sea to experience the sea, it seems to me&#x2014;and if you are in a gigantic floating play-center, and one that barely moves with the waves, then why not just stay home, and in doing so burn less fuel and pollute the world a little less?Q:Is it possible for 21st century humans to regain a sense of awe and respect for this magnificent natural wonder? What might it take for us to do so?Winchester:It is my fond hope that just a few good people who may read and like this book will stop for a moment, and perhaps then begin to think about and regard the ocean in a different way. And then maybe go down to the shore and look at it, and consider some of its wonders. And then, most importantly, tell the next generation that this body of water, like all the great oceanic bodies of water on the planet, is a rare and precious entity deserving of our care and our respect.  I realize this may be no more than wishful thinking: but after writing this book I have come to feel a very powerful connection with the Atlantic Ocean, and I so very much want others to look at it in the same way.Q:How does the Atlantic compare to other oceans? What makes it special/unique?Winchester:Of the world&#x2019;s great oceans the Atlantic is not the biggest; it is not the prettiest; it is not the most benign. But it does possess the greatest concentration of the marker-events of human history. And if, as seems unarguable, the Mediterranean could once fairly be said to have been the inland sea of classical civilization, then surely the Atlantic Ocean, by virtue of this huge concentration of ideas, events, inventions and developments, has become, and unarguably also, the inland sea of modern civilization. No other ocean comes close to filling this role &#x2013; which is why the Atlantic rises, head and shoulders, above all of its taller, prettier and calmer maritime cousins.",

For those unfamiliar with the series, a mysterious corporation has secretly been performing ungodly biotech experiments in the sleepy little town of Raccoon City. When reports of gory attacks come in from nearby areas, two crack military squads are sent to investigate. Players take the role of either sharpshooter Chris Redfield or demolitions expert Jill Valentine to track down the source of the town's problems--specifically, something in a decaying mansion that's mutating animals into grotesque killers and turning humans into bloodthirsty zombies. Supplies and ammunition are scarce, so players have to know when to fight, when to run, and how to keep their wits about them. Players can't afford to waste their shots and expect their characters to survive.The story is being retrofitted with motion-captured animation, next-generation graphics, real-time lighting and shadow effects, new areas, and newly rendered in-game video segments to create an even more cinematic experience. Also, a redesigned combat system lets players attack and defend themselves with a variety of items found in the environment.",

At least, that is Lady Xenobia India St. Clair&#x2019;s initial assessment when Thorn&#x2019;s stepmother, Eleanor, hires India to redecorate Starberry Court, the rundown country estate Thorn has recently purchased. Thorn is certain that his acquisition of Starberry Court will convince Laetitia Rainsford to accept his offer of marriage. India is equally convinced that if the ramshackle country estate doesn&#x2019;t scare Laetitia away, Thorn&#x2019;s own rough-around-the-edges appearance (not to mention his ancestry) will certainly do the trick. However, Eleanor is one of her dearest friends, and India has never yet backed down from a challenge. So, if all she has is three weeks to transform Starberry Court into a properly running home and turn Thorn into a civilized gentleman, India will just have to make it work. This tale is loosely linked to RITA Award&#x2013;winning James&#x2019; popular Desperate Duchesses series (Thorn is the son of the Duke of Villiers, the hero of A Duke of Her Own, 2009),  and her gift for creating complex, richly layered characters pays off with spectacular dividends in her latest scintillating and exquisitely written historical novel, a romantic tour de force. --John Charles",

        "0060987464": "One doesn't usually think of rock stars as insightful, but, against all odds, glam-trash superstar Marilyn Manson has written a book that is actually an intelligent look at growing up. This autobiographical bildungsroman brings out the creepiest aspects of childhood, conveying the terror and fascination that young Marilyn (then called Brian) felt when looking through his grandfather's pornography, getting his first French kiss, and being taunted by the girls he wanted to \"date.\" Manson has the benefit of having grown up as an outcast and loser and then having become a star without forgetting what he went through. This gives him an incredibly broad perspective, which he brings to bear on his ordinary life in order to convey the more potent and frightening moments that shaped him into the pale-skinned weirdo that the Christian Right loves to hate.  Best of all, Manson is shockingly honest, and portrays himself as occasionally stupid, self-centered, over-sensitive, ignoble, and, mostly, highly fallible and human. It's a long way from the auto-hagiographies that other stars have written, and it's easily one of the best reads in celebrity bio.--James DiGiovanna--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",
        "0061374229": "Amazon Best of the Month, June 2008: It's gutsy for a debut novelist to offer a modern take onHamletset in rural Wisconsin--particularly one in which the young hero, born mute, communicates with people, dogs, and the occasional ghost through his own mix of sign and body language. But David Wroblewski's extraordinary way with language inThe Story of Edgar Sawtelleimmerses readers in a living, breathing world that is both fantastic and utterly believable. In selecting for temperament and a special intelligence, Edgar's grandfather started a line of unusual dogs--the Sawtelles--and his sons carried on his work. But among human families, undesirable traits aren't so easily predicted, and clashes can erupt with tragic force. Edgar's tale takes you to the extremes of what humans must endure, and when you're finally released, you will come back to yourself feeling wiser, and flush with gratitude. And you will have remembered what magnificent alchemy a finely wrought novel can work. --Mari MalcolmBook DescriptionBorn mute, speaking only in sign, Edgar Sawtelle leads an idyllic life with his parents on their farm in remote northern Wisconsin. For generations, the Sawtelles have raised and trained a fictional breed of dog whose thoughtful companionship is epitomized by Almondine, Edgar's lifelong friend and ally. But with the unexpected return of Claude, Edgar's paternal uncle, turmoil consumes the Sawtelles' once peaceful home. When Edgar's father dies suddenly, Claude insinuates himself into the life of the farm--and into Edgar's mother's affections.Grief-stricken and bewildered, Edgar tries to prove Claude played a role in his father's death, but his plan backfires--spectacularly. Forced to flee into the vast wilderness lying beyond the farm, Edgar comes of age in the wild, fighting for his survival and that of the three yearling dogs who follow him. But his need to face his father's murderer and his devotion to the Sawtelle dogs turn Edgar ever homeward.David Wroblewski is a master storyteller, and his breathtaking scenes--the elemental north woods, the sweep of seasons, an iconic American barn, a fateful vision rendered in the falling rain--create a riveting family saga, a brilliant exploration of the limits of language, and a compulsively readable modern classic.Double Life, with Dogs: An Amazon Exclusive Essay by David WroblewskiWe write the stories we wish we could read. There's no other reason to do it, to spend years pacing around your basement, mumbling, pecking at a keyboard, turning your back on a world that offers such a feast of delicious fruits.The Story of Edgar Sawtellecame about because some time ago I wished I could read a novel about a boy and his dog, one that integrated our contemporary knowledge of canine behavior, cognition, and origins with my experience of living with dogs; if possible, something flavored with the uncynical Midwestern sense of heart and purpose so familiar from my childhood (and something which, in truth, I've spent much my adult life being slightly ashamed of, as if either heart or purpose were embarrassing attributes for a grown-up to display). I'd recently come to know a good dog, maybe the best dog I'd ever met, and the subject of people and dogs and ethics and character suddenly seemed urgent. But when I went looking for such a story, I had to go back almost a hundred years, back to Jack London'sCall of the Wild. That was a surprise. A little while after that, an idea for a story came to me--not the whole thing, but enough to start.Continue ReadingDouble Life, With DogsPraise from Stephen King\"I flat-out lovedThe Story of Edgar Sawtelle, and spent twelve happy evenings immersed in the world David Wroblewski has created. As I neared the end, I kept finding excuses to put the book aside for a little, not because I didn't like it, but because I liked it too much; I didn't want it to end. Dog-lovers in particular will find themselves riveted by this story, because the canine world has never been explored with such imagination and emotional resonance. Yet in the end, this isn't a novel about dogs or heartland America--although it is a deeply American work of literature. It's a novel about the human heart, and the mysteries that live there, understood but impossible to articulate. Yet in the person of Edgar Sawtelle, a mute boy who takes three of his dogs on a brave and dangerous odyssey, Wroblewskidoesarticulate them, and splendidly. I closed the book with that regret readers feel only after experiencing the best stories:It's over,you think,and I won't read another one this good for a long, long time.In truth, there's never been a book quite likeThe Story of Edgar Sawtelle. I thought ofHamletwhen I was reading it, andWatership Down, andThe Night of the Hunter, andThe Life of Pi--but halfway through, I put all comparisons aside and let it just be itself.I'm pretty sure this book is going to be a bestseller, but unlike some, it deserves to be. It's also going to be the subject of a great many reading groups, and when the members take upEdgar, I think they will be apt to stick to the book and forget the neighborhood gossip.Wonderful, mysterious, long and satisfying: readers who pick up this novel are going to enter a richer world. I envy them the trip. I don't re-read many books, because life is too short. I will be re-reading this one.\"",

First taken as a slave along with his less intrepid brother, Eli assimilates himself into Comanche culture, learning their arts of riding, hunting, and total warfare. When the tribe succumbs to waves of disease and settlers, Eli's only option is a return to Texas, where his acquired thirsts for freedom and self-determination set a course for his family's inexorable rise through the industries of cattle and oil.The Sonis Philipp Meyer's epic tale of more than 150 years of money, family, and power, told through the memories of three unforgettable narrators: Eli, now 100 and known simply as \"the Colonel\"; Eli's son Peter, called \"the great disappointment\" for his failure to meet the family&rsquo;s vision of itself; and Eli's great-granddaughter Jeanne Anne, who struggles to maintain the McCullough empire in the economic frontier of modern Texas. The book is long but never dull&mdash;Meyer's gift (and obsession) for historical detail and vernacular is revelatory, and the distinct voices of his fully fleshed-and-blooded characters drive the story. And let there be blood: some readers will flinch at Meyer's blunt (and often mesmerizing) portrayal of violence in mid-19th century Texas, but it&rsquo;s never gratuitous. His first novel, 2009'sAmerican Rust, drew praise for its stark and original characterization of post-industrial America, but Meyer has outdone himself withThe Son, as ambitious a book as any you&rsquo;ll read this year--or any year. Early reviewers call it a masterpiece, and while it's easy to dismiss so many raves as hyperbole,The Sonis an extraordinary achievement.--Jon Foro",

A rescue flight was quickly dispatched--it crashed in a November storm, stranding its own nine crewmembers. The third time was not the charm: a second rescue mission disappeared in another blizzard, leaving neither clues nor apparent survivors. Subsequent attempts--some with fatal results--failed under the harsh conditions, forcing the men to weather the Arctic winter in makeshift shelters, including the tail section of a broken bomber. This tale of survival in the deadliest conditions would be enthralling on its own (and it is), but Zuckoff's meticulous research led him to a modern-day group dedicated to solving the mystery of the third flight. As a chronicler of their mission, Zuckoff is swept into their adventure, and his project becomes much more than an interesting World War II subplot. PartAlive, part Shackleton,Frozen in Timeis a thrilling story of courage, perseverance, and loyalty that spans decades. --Jon Foro",

        "0060956445": "Ed Abbey calledThe Monkey Wrench Gang, his 1975 novel, a \"comic extravaganza.\" Some readers have remarked that the book is more a comic book than a real novel, and it's true that reading this incendiary call to protect the American wilderness requires more than a little of the old willing suspension of disbelief. The story centers on Vietnam veteran George Washington Hayduke III, who returns to the desert to find his beloved canyons and rivers threatened by industrial development. On a rafting trip down the Colorado River, Hayduke joins forces with feminist saboteur Bonnie Abbzug, wilderness guide Seldom Seen Smith, and billboard torcher Doc Sarvis, M.D., and together they wander off to wage war on the big yellow machines, on dam builders and road builders and strip miners. As they do, his characters voice Abbey's concerns about wilderness preservation (\"Hell of a place to lose a cow,\" Smith thinks to himself while roaming through the canyonlands of southern Utah. \"Hell of a place to lose your heart. Hell of a place... to lose. Period\"). Moving from one improbable situation to the next, packing more adventure into the space of a few weeks than most real people do in a lifetime, the motley gang puts fear into the hearts of their enemies, laughing all the while. It's comic, yes, and required reading for anyone who has come to love the desert.--Gregory McNamee--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

In the much-anticipated third volume of the Wicked Years, we return to Oz, seen now through the eyes of the Cowardly Lion&#8212;the once tiny cub defended by Elphaba inWicked.While civil war looms in Oz, a tetchy oracle named Yackle prepares for death. Before her final hour, an enigmatic figure known as Brrr&#8212;the Cowardly Lion&#8212;arrives searching for information about Elphaba Thropp, the Wicked Witch of the West. As payment, Yackle, who hovered on the sidelines of Elphaba's life, demands some answers of her own.Brrr surrenders his story to the ailing maunt: Abandoned as a cub, his earliest memories are gluey hazes, and his path from infancy in the Great Gillikin Forest is no Yellow Brick Road. Seeking to redress an early mistake, he trudges through a swamp of ghosts, becomes implicated in a massacre of trolls, and falls in love with a forbidding Cat princess. In the wake of laws that oppress talking Animals, he avoids a jail sentence by agreeing to serve as a lackey to the war-mongering Emperor of Oz.A Lion Among Menchronicles a battle of wits hastened by the Emerald City's approaching armies. What does the Lion know of the whereabouts of the Witch's boy, Liir? What can Yackle reveal about the auguries of the Clock of the Time Dragon? And what of the Grimmerie, the magic book that vanished as quickly as Elphaba? Is destiny ever arbitrary? Can those tarnished by infamy escape their sobriquets&#8212;cowardly, wicked, brainless, criminally earnest&#8212;to claim their own histories, to live honorably within their own skins before they're skinned alive?At once a portrait of a would-be survivor and a panoramic glimpse of a world gone shrill with war fever, Gregory Maguire's new novel is written with the sympathy and power that have made his books contemporary classics.About the AuthorGregory Maguire is the bestselling author ofConfessions of an Ugly Stepsister,Lost, Mirror Mirror, and the Wicked Years series, which includesWicked,Son of a Witch, andA Lion Among Men.Wicked, now a beloved classic, is the basis for the Tony Award-winning Broadway musical of the same name. Maguire has lectured on art, literature, and culture both at home and abroad. He lives with his family near Boston, Massachusetts.A Letter from Gregory MaguireDear friends,Here it is: volume three in my series coming to be known as The Wicked Years. I have had such warm reader response toWickedandSon of a Witch, both initially and in the years since, that the thought of adding to the series made me feel--well, cowardly. I resisted for a while. But courage comes to those who wait, sometimes: so here is volume three.A Lion Among Menfollows the peripatetic career of the Cowardly Lion. First seen inWickedas a lion cub culled from his pride for the purpose of laboratory experimentation, the Lion (known as Brrr) makes his name in that little Matter of Dorothy about which all of Oz is still talking. But one doesn&#x2019;t necessarily become lion-hearted by going after public approval, by racking up those medals and titles and golden statuettes at award ceremonies.Tarnished with scandal of every stripe, Brrr is loathed by the Animals who believe he betrayed them in helping Dorothy do in the Witch. He fares no better trying to live as a lion among men. When civil war breaks out in Oz, Brrr is caught in the line of fire as he interviews the mysterious old oracle, Yackle, about the sources of Elphaba&#x2019;s power. He must choose how much approval he can live without. A bit player all his life, he may yet be the linchpin on which the prosecution of the war rests.When I travel abroad (and the continuing success of the musicalWickedhas brought me to countries where it is now playing), I am sometimes met with bemusement about the origins of the material--a children&#x2019;s book made famous by a musical film for children!--how can this serve as a proper metaphor for a meditation about predestination and free will, about political opportunism and personal valor?Maybe, I say, you have to be an American to see that a vaudeville comedian in baggy lion-pajamas, as Burt Lahr seemed to me, has just as much right to inspire a story about the education of a hero as any Siegfried or Lancelot or Joan of Arc.And if they reply,You have some nerve!I answerThank you. I hope so.And I do thank you for your lion-hearted confidence in these wicked novels.-- Gregory",

Nineteen-year-old Tommy is a bewildered hipster recently relocated to San Francisco from Incontinence, Ind. His sarcastic redhead (and bloodsucking) girlfriend, Jody, brings him into the fold of the undead (\"I wanted us to be together,\" she says). Tommy, understandably, has mixed feelings; vampirism has its perks (you can turn to mist, live forever and the sex is awesome), but sunlight is death and blood hunger makes you do some pretty foul things. Also, the duo is hunted by Elijah, the ancient vampire who \"turned\" Jody and wants her back, and a band of Safeway stock boys/amateur vampire hunters known as the Animals (with whom pre&ndash;dark side Tommy once rolled). With the assistance of their devoted minion, goth girl Abby Normal, whose hilarious diary entries form part of the narrative, Tommy and Jody evade their pursuers, feeding at night and conking out at dawn, all the while learning how vampirism complicates love.

Along with fellow teacher Adam Meier, the two are the first foreigners to be in this part of the Sichuan province for 50 years. Expecting a calm couple of years, Hessler at first does not realize the social, cultural, and personal implications of being thrust into a such radically different society. InRiver Town: Two Years on the Yangtze, Hessler tells of his experience with the citizens of Fuling, the political and historical climate, and the feel of the city itself.\"Few passengers disembark at Fuling ... and so Fuling appears like a break in a dream--the quiet river, the cabins full of travelers drifting off to sleep, the lights of the city rising from the blackness of the Yangtze,\" says Hessler. A poor city by Chinese standards, the students at the college are mainly from small villages and are considered very lucky to be continuing their education. As an English teacher, Hessler is delighted with his students' fresh reactions to classic literature. One student says of Hamlet, \"I don't admire him and I dislike him. I think he is too sensitive and conservative and selfish.\" Hessler marvels,You couldn't have said something like that at Oxford. You couldn't simply say: I don't like Hamlet because I think he's a lousy person. Everything had to be more clever than that ... you had to dismantle it ... not just the play itself but everything that had ever been written about it.Over the course of two years, Hessler and Meier learn more they ever guessed about the lives, dreams, and expectations of the Fuling people.Hessler's writing is lovely. His observations are evocative, insightful, and often poignant--and just as often, funny. It's a pleasure to read of his (mis)adventures.

The sentient sea serpents have their own story hinted at, as well.ThoughShip of Magicis full of action, none of the plotlines get resolved in this book. Readers who resent being left with many questions and few answers after almost 700 pages should think twice before starting, or wait until the rest of the series is out so that their suspense won't be too prolonged. But Hobb's writing draws you in and makes you care desperately about what will happen next, the mark of a terrific storyteller.--Nona Vero--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

For example, players can choose to be a boy or a girl trainer, an internal clock sets events at certain times, and you&#x92;re the game's handy-dandy Pok&#xE9;dex helps players keep track of the many stats. You're main goal is still to beat all the Gym Trainers and become the Pok&#xE9;mon Master. If you've played the old games, you will be right at home. But not all is the same.The most obvious change is in the battles themselves. Now that two Pok&#xE9;mon can fight on your side at the same time, you can tag-team them against an enemy by taking advantage of the strengths of your Pok&#xE9;mons while covering their weaknesses. For example, you can now have a water Pok&#xE9;mon watch your fire Pok&#xE9;mon's back.  You can also attack more than one Pok&#xE9;mon at a time.A whole new element to the game focuses on how berries are used in battle. And if you collect enough berries, you can take them to a Berry Blender and make a Pok&#xE9;Block, which is a little super-charged candy that raises your Pok&#xE9;mon's \"Condition\" attributes. You can then groom your Pok&#xE9;mon for regional contests and compete for ribbons like \"Best of Show,\" which will unlock additional contests. There's even strategy in how to best use your berries: pick too many and the berry tree will disappear; plant berries, though, and a tree will grow. You can also build a Secret Base in special areas of the game, which you can decorate just like you can your room.And let us not forget that Pok&#xE9;mon Ruby has a kickin' multiplayer system, too. You can trade Pok&#xE9;mon, and link up to four players for incredible battles.

Though Horowitz is a cofounder of Andreessen Horowitz and his credentials reside mainly in Silicon Valley, he&#x2019;s imparted some valuable insight on hard lessons learned that apply to any manager, whether in the executive suite or not. As with most experiential books, it is all about him&#x2014;but it&#x2019;s written in such an engaging and universally acceptable manner that no one could object. Leave aside his background, for the moment. Who would realize, for instance, that executives worry about things like initiating layoffs, hiring the right people, training, and minimizing politics, among others? It&#x2019;s a refreshingly honest take, and his colorful (and, yes, profanity-laced) language breaks down any other misperceptions about the role and the person.

Logan, a few years older, became her courier father&#x2019;s apprentice when he was an orphan.

        "0061340634": "SignatureReviewed byAndrew O'HaganNovelists can no longer take it as an insult when people say their novels are like good television, because the finest American television is better written than most novels. Ann Patchett's new one has the texture, the pace and the fairy tale elegance of a half dozen novels she might have read and loved growing up, but the magic and the finesse ofRunis really much closer to that ofSix Feet UnderorERorThe Sopranos, and that is good news for everybody, not least her readers.Bernadette and Bernard Doyle were a Boston couple who wanted to have a big lively family. They had one boy, Sullivan, and then adopted two black kids, Teddy and Tip. Mr. Doyle is a former mayor of Boston and he continues his interest in politics, hoping his boys will shape up one day for elected office, though none of them seems especially keen. Bernadette dies when the adopted kids are just four, and much of the book offers a placid requiem to her memory in particular and to the force of motherhood in lives generally. An old statue from Bernadette's side of the family seems to convey miracles, and there will be more than one before this gracious book is done. One night, during a heavy snowfall, Teddy and Tip accompany their father to a lecture given by Jessie Jackson at the Kennedy Centre. Tip is preoccupied with studying fish, so he feels more than a little coerced by his father. After the lecture they get into an argument and Tip walks backwards in the road. A car appears out of nowhere and so does a woman called Tennessee, who pushes Tip out of the car's path and is herself struck. Thus, a woman is taken to hospital and her daughter, Kenya, is left in the company of the Doyles. Relationships begin both to emerge and unravel, disclosing secrets, hopes, fears.Runis a novel with timeless concerns at its heart&mdash;class and belonging, parenthood and love&mdash;and if it wears that heart on its sleeve, then it does so with confidence. And so it should: the book is lovely to read and is satisfyingly bold in its attempt to say something patient and true about family. Patchett knows how to wear big human concerns very lightly, and that is a continuing bonus for those who found a great deal to admire in her previous work, especially the ultra-laudedBel Canto. Yet one should not mistake that lightness for anything cosmetic:Runis a book that sets out inventively to contend with the temper of our times, and by the end we feel we really know the Doyle family in all its intensity and with all its surprises.Andrew O'Hagan's novel Be Near Mehas just been published by Harcourt.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Sonic is joined by five of his friends in a massive quest that spans over 50 game levels filled with remarkable visuals and a pulsating soundtrack. Taking full advantage of the unprecedented processing power of the Dreamcast, Sega's development crew, Sonic Team, has designed several gravity-defying game levels that will keep gamers hooked.Our favorite level is Windy Valley, which requires you to survive the stormy perils of a tremendous tornado. This tyrant of nature chases you relentlessly before ultimately sucking you into the air and up through its eye. During the chase, the tornado manages to tear up just about everything on the screen. This dizzying visual spectacle moves so fast that you will literally hold on to the game controller for dear life.Assuming you survive the tornado, there are several more challenging areas to conquer, including a level that requires you to snowboard directly in the path of a fast-approaching avalanche. During the Emerald Coast level, you will race across a precarious dock as a killer whale attacks from below, destroying the wood planks underneath your feet while you attempt to outrun the crazed creature.We also liked the numerous mini-games scattered throughout this title.

Jake Mishkin, a Manhattan intellectual property attorney and a bit of a rake, goes on the run from Russian gangsters. Albert Crosetti, an aspiring filmmaker working for an antiquarian bookstore, finds that life is more exciting than movies&mdash;perhaps too exciting. Together, Mishkin and Crosetti travel to England in search of a previously unknown Shakespeare manuscript mentioned by Bracegirdle. Though the pace sometimes slows to allow Mishkin, Crosetti and Bracegirdle to divulge interesting aspects of their personal lives, these digressions only make the story more engaging. The suspense created around the double-crosses and triple-crosses works because of the close connection readers forge with Crosetti in particular. The mysterious murder of a Shakespearean scholar, shootouts in the streets of Queens and an unlikely romance all combine to make for a gripping, satisfying read.(Apr.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0060188707": "There would seem to be little reason for yet another translation of Don Quixote. Translated into English some 20 times since the novel appeared in two parts in 1605 and 1615, and at least five times in the last half-century, it is currently available in multiple editions (the most recent is the 1999 Norton Critical Edition translated by Burton Raffel). Yet Grossman bravely attempts a fresh rendition of the adventures of the intrepid knight Don Quixote and his humble squire Sancho Panza. As the respected translator of many of Latin America's finest writers (among them Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Carlos Fuentes and Mario Vargas Llosa), she is well suited to the task, and her translation is admirably readable and consistent while managing to retain the vigor, sly humor and colloquial playfulness of the Spanish. Erring on the side of the literal, she isn't afraid to turn out clunky sentences; what she loses in smoothness and elegance she gains in vitality. The text is free of archaisms the contemporary reader will rarely stumble over a word and the footnotes (though rather erratically supplied) are generally helpful. Her version easily bests Raffel's ambitious but eccentric and uneven effort, and though it may not immediately supplant standard translations by J.M. Cohen, Samuel Putnam and Walter Starkie, it should give them a run for their money. Against the odds, Grossman has given us an honest, robust and freshly revelatory Quixote for our times.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Bryson's curiosity serves him well, as he delves into subjects as diverse as the reliability of the extant images of Shakespeare, a brief history of the theater in England and the continuing debates about whether William Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon really wrote Shakespeare's works.

I like my own pillow, my own imperfect showerhead, my coffee and pizza and bagel shops, my little rituals.  I am quite old lady-ish about it.  I like to write in&mdash;and only in&mdash;my radically unbeautiful office (I share it with guinea pigs).  I like to drive my kids to swimming.  At night, the moment when I shut my book, turn off my bedside table light, and know that everyone is sleeping under the same roof,our roof, is as close to a state of grace as I ever hope to come.  I have always been this person.So it is probably not surprising that, until now, my writing has stuck close to home, as well.  In the first two novels, my characters did a little meandering but rarely outside of the 95 corridor, never outside of the country.  They needed no passports; they never suffered jet lag.  And now, withFalling Together, what have I done but put Will, Augusta, Jason, and my poor aviophobic Pen on airplane after airplane and sent them clear across the world?   What was I thinking?  I was thinking about the story, mostly, and that these were people who, each in her or his own way needed to go in quest of something (apart from Augusta, who has everything she needs).  Also, I was thinking that the Philippines, where my father grew up, is too beautiful, too much a part of the landscape of my heart not to write about.I visited the Philippines for the first time when I was 22 and on Christmas Day, woke up to voluminous sunshine, enfolding heat, a houseful of relatives, and a roasted suckling pig, pointy-eared, tiger&rsquo;s eye-orange, and smelling like bliss. I was not in Kansas (or Virginia) anymore.  I rode in dazzlingly painted jeepneys; I visited roadside fruit stands as resplendent as parade-floats and cemeteries in which people laughed, ate, and talked as though they were in their own living rooms and the gravestones were furniture or friends.  I atea lot:  the little fists of bread called Elordes after the boxer; rice sticky with coconut milk; fish with blue bones like a secret; fruit shaped like sea anemones, hedgehogs, brains; heavenly, palm-sized mangoes with flesh you can scoop like custard.Amid all of these discoveries, the best part was the people, a branch (or palm frond) of my family tree that I had only seen in glimpses.  Now, this family surrounded me.  I learned that traits I thought were uniquely my father&rsquo;s&mdash;having conversations with his eyebrows, a brusque, instinctive generosity that shrugged off thanks&mdash;were family or cultural traits.  I learned thathomeis a word that can stretch.  Since that first visit, I&rsquo;ve been back many times since, especially since my parents retired there six years ago, and every time,homestretches to include something new:  a coral reef, a helper&rsquo;s bewitching baby, a soup made of mung beans, a tiny tarsier&rsquo;s enormous eyes.InFalling Together, Pen goes to the Philippines in search of her friend, but I think she finds more than that.  She sits in a banca boat with a school of jackfish shoaling beneath it and thinks, awestruck, &ldquo;All this time, every second:this.&rdquo;  She experiences the world as big and small at the same time.  While I sit at my desk, drive my children around, sleep under my roof, all the time, every second, there is another version of home, my home, vibrantly alive and unfolding itself thousands of miles away.  The least I could do was put it in a book.A Look InsideFalling TogetherClick on the images below to open larger versions.Alona Palms: This endless pool is at the beach resort that inspired the fancy one where part ofFalling Togetheris set.Charles and Tarsier: The author&rsquo;s son in the tarsier sanctuary with a tiny friend.Chocolate Hills: The famous hills in Bohol, from the same overlook where Jason bursts into tears and Pen comforts him.",
        "0060574534": "Smith has clearly taken lessons from a few successful writers of chick lit (\"Days Without Sex: 0\"), but his boy version of Bridget Jones lacks the key ingredient: a sympathetic protagonist. Tom Farrell, 32, lives in Manhattan and works at a publication called Tabloid (a dead ringer for the New York Post), which proudly proclaims itself to be \"America's loudest newspaper.\" Farrell's job is that of \"rewrite man,\" redoing stories by shaping them into salacious shorts and then coming up with eye-catching headlines. As he puts it, however, his \"most time-consuming hobby is collecting ex-girlfriends,\" and the novel-which chronicles five months in Farrell's life-is mostly a jumbled catalogue of his failed love affairs. There's Julia, a co-worker Farrell can't get out of his head; Bran, a platonic friend he might try to get into his bed; Katie, a budding lawyer; and Liesl, an earnest German paralegal. Smith, the book and music review editor at People magazine, writes in glossy and accessible magazine prose (Farrell describes a co-worker as \"a girl whose hotitude was... off the charts\") and his New York patter can be clever. Searching for its place somewhere between Nick Hornby in subject matter and David Sedaris in its wit, this novel rests uneasily between the two. Publishing and journalism insiders will enjoy Smith's spot-on description of the tabloid life, but women looking for insights into the male psyche, the real potential readership here, may not take kindly to Smith's unflattering dissection of his dates. Still, this is a lively, promising debut.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.",

The Zapper comes withLink's Crossbow Training, which helps to familiarize the player with the Zapper in a shooting gallery style game.Link's Crossbow Trainingcontains three game styles: target shooting, defender and ranger.Features:Target Shooting: In target-shooting rounds, players shoot bull's-eyes as they pop up on the screen. In early stages, targets are stationary. As the game difficulty increases in later levels, the targets move. Hitting the center of the bull's-eye nets more points, and hitting targets in succession without missing earns combo multipliers. Link can aim anywhere on the screen.Defender: In defender rounds, players remain stationary but can look and aim in all directions by aiming off screen. Hordes of enemies assault Link, and he must fight them off. These battles have a great deal of variety, from fighting off skeletons in a desert to defending a wagon from boar-riding Bokoblins.Ranger: In ranger rounds, players can move throughout the level using the control stick and aim anywhere they want by aiming the Wii Zapper wherever they want to look. In these missions, Link storms enemy encampments, fights his way through a forest and seeks out his foes while exploring the environments.The Wii Remote and Nunchuk are sold separately",

        "B0007TFLLC": "The era of no-compromises handheld gaming has arrived. Get ready for immersive, 3D gaming on a console that is poisedto change the way we think about portable devices. With wireless internet, video and digital music playback, and incredible data storage and connectivity options, the Sony PSP--or PlayStation Portable--is a complete solution for the mobile digital lifestyle. Sony has hit the mark by combining both horsepower and groundbreaking features into a package that weighs just a hair more than half a pound.DesignThe PSP's exceptional performance comes from a 333 MHz processor that dwarfs the speed of competing handheld consoles. Add this polygon-pushing muscle to 4 MB of fast DRAM and 32 MB of embedded RAM, and you've got a device with graphics rendering capabilities close to that of the PlayStation2. And because no game is complete without audio, the PSP is generously appointed with built-in stereo speakers, as well Dolby Digital 7.1 surround sound capability. Sony has also pulled out all the stops with the PSP display. The bright, 4.3-inch LCD sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution--plenty of real estate for heavy gaming action and widescreen-format movies. All of this is powered by a removable, and rechargeable, lithium-ion battery.Screen machine: The 4.3-inch display sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution. Movies and games on the go have never been more gorgeous.From a controls perspective, the PSP is made for gaming. If you're familiar with a PlayStation controller, you'll be a pro at the PSP's controls in no time. Directional buttons, as well as an analog stick are provided. Meanwhile, the familiar left and right shoulder buttons, as well as triangle, circle, cross and square buttons are integrated into the device's slim case. Finally, home, select, and start buttons give you quick access and control over the PSP's important functions.To have and to hold: The PSP's easy-to-master controls are cleverly integrated into the device's slim profile.Supported MediaAt the heart of the PSP is a new, proprietary media format known as the Universal Media Disc, or UMD. Each UMD can hold 1.8 GB of data, enough room for rich and complex games. UMDs, which are housed in a protective cover, slide into the rear of the PSP. Sony has declared the UMD an open format for developers and media content owners, so movies, music and other media are on the horizon from third parties. Sony has also signed on many popular game developers for the platform, so a deep library of titles is on tap.While the UMD is great for read-only media such as games and movies, Sony solves the problem of data storage with the addition of a Memory Stick Duo slot. With Memory Stick Duo media, you can store your saved games, downloaded online content, personal video and audio files, and more. When you want access to these files from your PC, simply use the PSP's USB 2.0 port to turn the device into a fast portable media drive. Then, drag and drop files such as your photos, MP3s, and videos onto the PSP, just as you would any other removable storage device. The PSP ships with a 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, and additional media with higher storage capacities are available.Major media: Sony's PSP-compatible Universal Media Disc (UMD) can hold 1.8 GB of data.ConnectivityThe PSP blows away the competition in the connectivity department. Indeed, the PSP's ability to connect to the internet, and to other PSPs and USB-based peripherals, is a real advantage. At the top of the list is Wifi connectivity, or IEEE 801.11b. Use this wireless internet standard to connect to other gamers around the world for hot multiplayer action--all from your couch, or your local Wifi hotspot. As mentioned, the PSP's USB 2.0 port is great for PC connectivity, but it also opens the PSP up for a whole range of future peripherals. Sony has plans for the PSP in other ways, too; the unit's infrared port speaks of remote control capabilities in the near future.A Digital CompanionIf you haven't already guessed, Sony has positioned the PSP to be much more than a gaming device. Out of the box, the device is ready to serve as a portable video player and photo viewer. By using the new H.264 MPEG-4 video standard, Sony obviously has its eyes on making the PSP a robust video device with support for feature length movies and more. In addition, the PSP offers a great way to transport and share your photos in JPEG format. And let's not forget the music. Load up your favorite MP3-encoded songs onto a Memory Stick Duo and you've got a portable audio powerhouse. The device also supports Sony's ATRAC audio codec, so you can play songs acquired from Sony's Connect Online Music Store. Sony even ships a nifty pair of earbuds--complete with an inline remote control-- with the PSP.What's in the BoxPSP device, AC adapter, battery pack, 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, earbud headphones with remote control, soft case and hand strap.",

Called in to investigate the apparent suicide of a male Grant Tech student, Sara brings along her pregnant sister, Tessa, who wanders away from the scene and is brutally attacked. The distraught Sara must work side by side with her ex-husband, Det. Jeffrey Tolliver, whom she loves despite his past infidelity, but it's Lena Adams, formerly a cop and now a campus security guard, whose story the novel follows most closely. Still mourning the murder of her sister and recovering from her own torture and rape by the same man, Lena is looked on with suspicion by her ex-boss, Jeffrey. With reason: she's hiding a few key facts. The dead boy's mother is her therapist and Lena is involved with an abusive young man with a shady past. Campus gossip Richard Carter further confuses investigators; meanwhile, police discover the bodies of two more students, their deaths potentially suicides but more likely murder. Slaughter provides grisly variations on the themes of sibling rivalry, sexual abuse and campus politics in a story not for the faint of heart. Readers who can stomach gruesome details and like fitting together multiple stories of physical and psychological abuse will savor the way Slaughter can evoke sympathy for perverse, even criminal, behavior by tracing its origins, and those who make it through the complexities and the gore will be rewarded with a satisfyingly chilling ending.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

Their role is to nurture all knowledge while safeguarding it from the vagaries of the irrational saecular outside world.

        "0099459051": "In the sixth Kurt Wallander book to appear in English (One Step Behind, etc.), Mankell proves once again that spending time with a glum police inspector in chilly Sweden can be quite thrilling. In the small town of Ystad, a pair of seemingly random events take place within a matter of days: two teenage girls with no apparent motive brutally beat and stab a taxi driver to death, and a remarkably healthy man checks his bank balance at an ATM and then collapses dead on the sidewalk. After two more odd murders, Wallander becomes convinced that the incidents are all connected. The recurring clues demonstrating the vulnerability of society in the electronic age remain just outside of the Luddite inspector's understanding. But once he detects a conspiracy to collapse the world's financial infrastructure on a specific date, Wallander, whose position at work is already imperiled, ignores office politics and protocol to stop the would-be revolutionary. Although Wallander and his investigative team are forced to work at a dizzying speed, the pace of the book is just right, doling out new leads and intrigues right when they're needed. The only shortcoming in this otherwise smartly written mystery is that too many of the most perplexing clues discovered by Wallander are dismissed as red herrings or coincidence. Overall, however, Mankell's ambitious endeavor to combine large themes with small-town murder is a notable success.Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

I createdSouthern Plateso that I could share the recipes and stories that have been passed down through my family for more than nine generations.You won't find fancy food or new-fangled recipes in this cookbook&mdash;just easy, no-fuss Southern favorites such as Chicken and Dumplings, Homemade Banana Pudding, Aunt Looney's Macaroni Salad, Fried Green Tomatoes, and Daddy's Rise-and-Shine Biscuits. (I want to make one thing as clear as possible: How your mama made it is the right way! I'm going to bring it to you how my mama made it, which is the only right way for me.)These stories and recipes come from my heart. They are a gift from my ancestors, but the ability to have them heard is a gift from you. Take a seat at theSouthern Platetable; you're with family now.FromSouthern Plate: Lela&rsquo;s Fried Fruit PiesThese are my great-grandmother&rsquo;s pies. I remember Lela standing in the kitchen humming as she fried these, placing the crispy treats on a paper towel&ndash;lined plate next to the stove as she dipped more into the hot oil in her cast-iron skillet. The entire house smelled of peaches, because that was her favorite kind of fruit pie.If you&rsquo;re yearning for an old-fashioned fried pie like Granny used to make, you&rsquo;ve come to the right place. This recipe can easily be modified to accommodate your favorite dried fruit. Feel free to modify it to accommodate your own tastes. Most folks start out making these with dried apples but even though we love apples, nothing can beat a fried pie made with dried peaches.Filling6 to 7 ounces dried fruit (I used peaches; you can also use apples, apricots, or other dried fruit)2 cups water1 cup sugar1 tablespoon lemon juice1&frasl;2 teaspoon ground cinnamonPlace the dried fruit in a large saucepan and add the water and sugar. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until the fruit is tender and the sugar is dissolved, about 20 minutes. Add all the other ingredients and mash together with a potato masher or fork. Set aside while you prepare the dough.Dough2 cups all-purpose flour1 teaspoon salt1&frasl;2 cup shortening1&frasl;2 cup milk, plus more if neededVegetable oilDirectionsTo make the dough, in a medium bowl, combine the flour and salt. Cut in the shortening with a long-tined fork. Add the milk and stir until the dough sticks together. Divide into 10 portions. Roll each portion out on a floured surface into a 5- or 6-inch circle. Place 2 tablespoons of filling in each. Wet the edges and fold over, crimping with a fork.In a large skillet, pour the oil to a depth of 1&frasl;4 inch and heat over medium heat.

The cover is cluttered and confusing, and do we really need 500-plus pages of Foley's boasts? Yes. Foley gives his all for his calling, and he burns to tell his adventures. Take the famous tale of how he lost most of his ear (the bloody result is depicted in the 16-page color-photo section). It was in his 1994 bouts with Vader (Leon White): after getting a broken nose, a dislocated jaw, and 21 stitches in the first match, Foley did his \"hangman\" routine, wherein he catches his neck between the second and third ropes and spins them into a twist. \"The end result is the illusion of a man being hanged by his neck while his body kicks and writhes in an attempt to get out... the man actuallyishanging by his neck and the body reallydoeskick and writhe in an attempt to get out.\" Unfortunately, in the prior match, Too Cold Scorpio had had the officials tighten the ropes, so Foley tore off his ear to avoid death by strangulation, like \"a fox that chews off its paw to escape a trap.\" Foley also wrestles on 10,000-thumbtack mats with barbwire ropes and C-4 explosives, and earns the ultimate compliment: \"The fans really like the way you bleed.\" Many fans also like the way his gory story reads.--Tim Appelo",

Kerner first explored \"the oral caress\" as a way of compensating for his \"sexual inadequacies,\" and quickly learned that women not only welcomed but often preferred \"the way of the tongue,\" reaching orgasm more consistently than through intercourse. Kerner educates readers about the clitoris, \"the powerhouse of pleasure,\" with 18 parts and 8,000 nerve endings (twice as many as the penis) and describes female sexual response from \"foreplay\" through \"coreplay\" to \"moreplay.\"  A large part of the book is a graphic, detailed primer on  \"mouth music,\" including best positions, step-by-step techniques (illustrated), and tips for tongue and fingers. How long should this last? Until the woman has an orgasm or many, says Kerner, and \"melts blissfully before your eyes.\" \"The vast majority of women complain about guys who don't like to do it, don't know how to do it, or simply don't do it nearly enough,\" writes Kerner.

In a world overrun by private military companies (PMCs), wars are no longer fought over nations or ideologies. Instead, the wars of the future are micro-managed by overarching PMCs, right down to the bullet. New gadgets and abilities fuel Snake's journey deep into the enemy domains of the Middle East, South America, and beyond. New gear includes \"Metal Gear Mk.

But Liquid Ocelot is not the only one who will be able to manipulate the world's wars--Snake can destabilize opposing forces by working behind the scenes, supporting the local militia as they fight PMCs, creating a smokescreen that allows Snake to move freely within the war-zone.MGS4 is a next-generation adventure set in the aftermath ofMGS2: Sons of Liberty. The concept behind the latestMetal Gear Solidproject is \"no place to hide,\" and this edition in the series will force Snake into unexpected circumstances with an all-new storyline that breaks away in some ways from the previousMGSfranchise entries. We don't want to spoil it for you, but, producer Hideo Kojima did reveal some very juicy tidbits about the game and the storyline when it was first announced at E3 of 2006. \"Until now,\" said Kojima, \"we've released two entries of theMSX2 Metal Gearseries, and three entries in theMetal Gear Solidseries. Add to thisPortable Ops, and you get a total of six titles. All mysteries will be cleared up inMetal Gear Solid 4.\"Kojima was very clear about the finality ofMSG4, leaving gamers to wonder, \"Will Snake die?!\" When asked if the story will come to this sort of an end, Kojima responded without the slightest bit of vagueness, \"It will come to an end.\" TheMGS4E3 trailer showed a number of characters from theMetal GearandMetal Gear Solidhistories. This final installment is sure to deliver loads of cameos, in fact, it is rumored that nearly all the characters from the series will make an appearance.In addition to a return of classicMetal Gear Solidcharacters, the gameplay systems from part three are also expected to make a comeback. The camouflage system from part three will make it intoMGS4, with the addition of \"OctoCamo,\" Snake's most advanced stealth suit to date. The name appears to be formed from the words \"Octopus\" and \"camoflauge,\" and players will be awestruck by the chameleon-like camo that changes with the surroundings. OctoCamo allows Snake to blend in with his environment as it digitally manifests nearby textures in real time. Think if it this way, if Snake is standing next to a wall worn out with holes, he too will appear to be riddled with holes. It has also been revealed thatMGS4will have online play, but no specifics have been released. Although very little information is known about the game's visuals, rumor has it thatMGS4is expected to be the finest representation of console graphics on the PS3, and it is expected that they will just get better and better as the game nears its release date.",

Wearing her black lace mittens, Miss Marple sits in her chair, knitting and digesting details of murders of all descriptions (from poisonings to a drowning to a shooting by bow and arrow). She manages, of course, to see through all false identities and bogus alibis, and neatly solves each puzzle, no matter how obscure or far-fetched. The bulk of the stories are gathered from The Tuesday Club murders, chronicling the meetings of a group formed by Miss Marple and a handful of her friends.

Lulu Minturn is a white Californian who&rsquo;d run away with a Chinese painter, established the best courtesan house in Shanghai and given birth to a beautiful &ldquo;Eurasian&rdquo; (in the parlance of the time) daughter, Violet. Soon, either because she was tricked or deceitful, Lulu abandons Violet and flees back to America; history soon is in danger of repeating itself when Violet gives birth to her own daughter. (Eventually, the scene shifts to California, where the family searches for redemption and reconciliation.) Nobody does mother-daughter angst and cross cultural conflict better than Tan, who has been literally writing the book(s) on these topics for years. What makes this novel special is its meticulous language--readers may be struck by the juxtaposition of poetry and Anglosaxon equivalents in descriptions of courtesans&rsquo; sex lives--and its elucidation of the cultural upheavals at the time. This is as much a historical novel as it is a family story, at once intimate and sweeping, personal and political. You&rsquo;ll have learned something by the end--and you&rsquo;ll probably also be weeping.  --Sara Nelson",

Bethanne Hamlin, a recent divorc&eacute;e, and Elise Beaumont, who's been single for years, are both still suffering from their broken marriages. Serving as sounding boards and sources of endless support for each other, the women find friendship and, of course, resolution for their problems (the latter a little too easily). Readers will missThe Shop on Blossom Street's spirited Jacqueline, who plays a minor role here, and a few things&mdash;like the character of Elise's ex-husband, Maverick&mdash;strain credibility. But the author's trademark warm treatment of the lives of women will satisfy her readers. Despite occasional draughts of treacle and a too-easy denouement, this should be another Macomber bestseller.(May)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0060937998": "Amazon Significant Seven, October 2007: There's no book this year that made people's eyes light up when I told them about it more thanSchulz and Peanuts, David Michaelis's new biography of cartoonist Charles Schulz. (And when they saw the obvious-but-brilliant Chip Kidd-designed cover, their eyes got even brighter.) Everyone, it seems, feels a personal connection to Peanuts (a name, by the way, that Schulz always hated), but few have a sense of the artist whose small troupe of big-headed characters still lives at the center of our imagination. If some mystery about the man still remains after reading Michaelis's sharp, engaging, and level-headed biography that's no fault of the biographer--in fact, it's to his credit. Michaelis parses Schulz's particular combination of Midwestern reserve and steely determination and the strip's still-surprising balance of exuberance and misery, and he reminds us what a colossal cultural force it became, especially in the 1960s. But even as he ingeniously finds sources for Schulz's four-panel vignettes in the events of his biography, he recognizes that the true, sometimes inexplicable drama of his life took place when he sat down every day for 50 years to trace Linus's wobbly strands of hair, fill in Snoopy's black nose, and, time and again, letter the words \"Good grief.\"--Tom Nissley--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

        "B000FRU1UM": "What does the American Dream mean today?For Niko Bellic, fresh off the boat from Europe, it is the hope he can escape his past. For his cousin, Roman, it is the vision that together they can find fortune in Liberty City, gateway to the land of opportunity. As they slip into debt and are dragged into a criminal underworld by a series of shysters, thieves and sociopaths, they discover that the reality is very different from the dream in a city that worships money and status, and is heaven for those who have them and a living nightmare for those who don&#146;t.Beginning with the 1997 release of the originalGrand Theft Auto, theGTAseries has been one of the most prolific, controversial and down right entertaining franchises in video games history. This pedigree of success guarantees that the highly anticipated eleventh game in the series,Grand Theft Auto IV, will garner at least as much attention if not more.Return to Liberty City.The dream as Niko expected it.View larger.There's always a catch.View larger.But some skills are international.View larger.The PlotGrand Theft Auto IVis a brand new adventure in theGTAuniverse following the experiences of Nikolai \"Niko\" Bellic, a new immigrant from an undisclosed eastern European country whose troubled pa  st and the persuasion of his cousin Roman have brought him to the fictional Liberty City. Unfortunately, Niko&#146;s search for the American Dream and a much needed fresh start, hits an immediate snag when the rags to riches story Roman spun to pique Niko's interest is exposed as not only a complete fabrication, but a ploy to enlist Niko&#146;s well-known skills as a tough guy against the ample list of enemies clamoring for Roman&#146;s debt-ridden blood.Because Roman is the only person Niko knows in Liberty City he begrudgingly accepts his role as Roman&#146;s protector despite the deception. But as time goes on Niko comes into his own, and his experience on the wrong side of the tracks proves more valuable than he could have ever imagined as he fights for survival and later supremacy on the crime ridden streets of Liberty City.Game EnvironmentsBased on several of the boroughs of New York City and parts of New Jersey, Liberty City, familiar to players of previous games in  the series, has been entirely redesigned forGTA IV. Players can expect visible detail down to the weeds growing in the cracks in the sidewalk, cars and buildings of visibly different ages and a much greater level if verticality in the buildings and bridges that they are able to explore as Niko moves through the city streets. In addition, pedestrians inGTA IVare much more realistic. No longer simply moving cardboard cutouts, these NPCs are intelligent, modern, human representations that laugh, cry, eat, drink, use cell phones and ATMs, and talking amongst themselves regardless of Niko&#146;s interaction with them.GameplayHistoricallyGTAgames have focused heavily on mission-based play, requiring successful completion of fixed tasks in order for players to progress through the game, but this has changed to a great extent inGTA IV. Players will experience an entirely new and exciting emphasis centered on the blending of on-mission and off-mission play, resulting not only in an increased sense of realism, but more interesting and unrestricted gameplay.FeaturesAside from the car jacking and a detailed city environment here are the new features forGTA IV:Improved combat system - Now you can use cover and also a target lock system, which allows you to take out targets with greater ease and accuracy. Plus, you can engage in some hand-to-hand combat if you can't get your hands on a piece quick enough.Cell phone - Not just for basic phone calls anymore.  Use your in-game cell phone to receive missions via SMS, snap photos, and ZiT (tag) songs that can be downloaded exclusively on Amazon.com/mp3.Free time - In between missions you can take advantage of \"me\" time.  There are gentleman's clubs, comedy clubs, bowling alleys, and bars, which all house unique activities.Take a break from the storyline - A variety of side missions allow you to help run a car service, \"borrow\" cop cars, assassinate targets, help solve problems for those on the street, or take to the air with stunt jumps that are scattered all over the city.Control your own fate - Throughout the game choice moments will arrive causing you to make a decision that will affect relationships and money.MultiplayerGive Niko a rest and create your own multiplayer \"hero.\"GTAhas added multiplayer modes allowing you to take your creation out to play online in competitive, co-op, and free form modes. Competitive mode has you fighting against the cops, jacking cars, or racing to finish odd jobs.  Co-op challenges you and your friends with various tasks including Hangman's NOOSE where you are responsible for escorting a wanted kingpin to a safe extraction point.  Freeform lets you and 15 others lose on Liberty City.  Use this mode to hit up the bar and play virtual darts versus each other or head out to the streets and set up your own drag races.  If you can dream it, you can do it in Freeform mode.ZiT: We'll Spot The Song For YouWhen playing Grand Theft Auto IV, if you hear a song that you are interested in buying as an MP3, all you have to do is dial ZiT-555-0100 on your in-game mobile phone and a text message will be sent to you with the name of the artist and the title of the track. The next time you log in at theRockstar Games Social Club, you will find 30-second previews of all the songs you have ZiT'ed while playing the game.

A serial killer taunts Harry Hole in Nesb&oslash;'s searing third crime novel to feature the Oslo police detective to be made available in the U.S. (afterNemesis). Still suffering from alcohol-fueled demons and obsessed with hunting for evidence against a clearly dirty cop, Hole grudgingly agrees to help look into the murder of a woman whose finger has been amputated and a red diamond stuck under her eyelid. More bodies follow, with the murderer leaving identical five-pointed diamonds (the titular devil's star) at each crime scene. At first the killings appear to be random, but Hole soon discovers an ominous pattern. Nesb&oslash; brilliantly incorporates threads from earlier novels, including Hole's often tumultuous relationship with his lover, Rakel, without ever losing the current story's rhythm. Even with&mdash;or perhaps because of&mdash;his flaws, Hole is arguably one of today's most fascinating fictional detectives.5-city author tour.

        "0061053562": "InThe Player of Games, Iain M. Banks presents a distant future  that could almost be called the end of history. Humanity has filled the galaxy, and thanks to ultra-high technology everyone has everything they want, no one gets sick, and no one dies. It's a playground society of sports, stellar cruises, parties, and festivals. Jernau Gurgeh, a famed master game player, is looking for something more and finds it when he's invited to a game tournament at a small alien empire. Abruptly Banks veers into different territory. The Empire of Azad is exotic, sensual, and vibrant. It has space battle cruisers, a glowing court--all the stuff of good old science fiction--which appears old-fashioned in contrast to Gurgeh's home. At first it's a relief, but further exploration reveals the empire to be depraved and terrifically unjust. Its defects are gross exaggerations of our own, yet they indict us all the same. Clearly Banks is interested in the idea of a future where everyone can be mature and happy. Yet it's interesting to note that in order to give us this compelling adventure story, he has to return to a more traditional setting. Thoughtful science fiction readers will appreciate the cultural comparisons, and fans of big ideas and action will also be rewarded.--Brooks Peck",
        "0061655953": "Andrew Gross on Becoming a WriterI&rsquo;m often asked, how did you get into this trade, as my resume--an MBA from Columbia and sixteen years in the rag and sports apparel business--never exactly made a compelling case for the title:New York Timesbestselling author.But one of the great things about people writing thrillers today is that they come to their craft from disparate and compelling walks of life--lawyers, journalists, doctors, ad men, CIA operatives&mdash;and bring with them the experience of lives not spent in MFA programs and literary salons, but working amid the issues and crises that affectourworld every day.In 1996, I left my job as the head of a ski and golfwear company to take a flyer on a whim I had&mdash;well, more like an obsession. Like a million people, I had carried the lifelong urge to get out a story that was inside me, in my case a Manchurian Candidate-styled conspiracy novel calledHydraabout a political takeover of the country that featured a strong heroine. I begged my wife to grant me a year, a year without income, a year without knowing where this new path would take us, declaring I&rsquo;d earned it, deserved it. (She was a yoga teacher, so it wasn&rsquo;t too hard to get her to agree!) Of course, we both knew that writing&mdash;to say nothing of actually selling&mdash;a first novel is more difficult than you think. The year turned into two&mdash;and then three.I never thought I was being frivolous along the way. I always believed it would happen. I got some praise, and built on that, but I kept getting rejections too. Twenty-five of them from prospective agents.  Finally, one came on board. A high powered one. My first real validation!  With a ton of enthusiasmHydrawas pitched to two dozen publishers and two weeks later I had letters from all of them&mdash;all rejections again! Each seemed to contain some encouragement, but for each there was some element&mdash;the story was too political or too controversial&mdash;that got in the way. I was out of options.  I knew I would not be able to write a second one. I had a family to support. But in my heart I felt I had the chops. I had no idea what my next step in life would be.As I sat around, unsure and dismayed, I received a call&mdash;completely out of the blue, like a cheesy plot twist, except this one was real&mdash;from a woman who asked if I would take a call fromJames Patterson. Ahem!  I cleared my throat and paused a couple of seconds, so as not to convey the utter desperation my life was sinking under then, and answered, yeah, sure, I could fit him in!Thinking back twelve years, Jim wasn&rsquo;t quite the James Patterson we know now&mdash;where everything he publishes rockets straight to #1, the top selling thriller author in the country. He was a successful writer with a plan, looking to expand into multiple storylines, and one was about four dynamic women who form this bond, this koffee klatch of sorts, to share their life experiences and ultimately to solve crimes. Unbeknownst to me, my manuscriptHydrahad been handed to him by the head of his own publishing house (who originally elected to pass on it) with five words written on the cover: \"This guy does women well!!!\"  Jim read it, liked it, and most importantly,actedon it. He was looking to partner with someone. His call changed my writing life!Now maybe he had designs onThe Women's Murder Clubbecoming the second most successful crime series in fiction today (after his ownAlex Crossseries), but I didn&rsquo;t. I was just looking to scratch my way inside the circle that had been inaccessible so far, with a chance to pick up some tips from one of the best. A day later, we met for breakfast at a diner in White Plains. I bought into his vision for the characters and the story. I drove home and cranked out a couple of sample chapters and faxed them over...And the partnership lasted seven years!We did Women&rsquo;s Murder Club books set in San Francisco, a book set in the Middle Ages, one built around a Mafia trial I was a juror on, and one about art theft in Palm Beach. And when the time came for me to go out on my own, not only did I have a platform of readers who knew and hopefully loved the books we did together, and a bit of name recognition, but I felt schooled in Thriller Writing 401. I had an idea that eventually becameThe Blue Zone. It hit theNew York Timesbestseller list and sold in 23 countries. I&rsquo;ve followed that up with two other bestsellers,The Dark TideandDon&rsquo;t Look Twice.So a quick word about what I do now: I don&rsquo;t write Patterson-clones. Never intended to. But I do build on many of the techniques I learned with him, elements that I think any author can profit from, regardless of their literary ambition. Short, dramatic chapters that end on a punch and link to the one that follows. Investing your reader in the hero&rsquo;s plight within the first ten pages. Lots of twists and surprises. Start with a bang.My new thrillerRecklessbegins this way: a harrowing home break-in gone heartbreakingly wrong, leading to the suspicious deaths of larger-than-life Wall Street managers, a wealthy divorcee&rsquo;s fears that her new love is not the person he appears to be, and ultimately, to a gripping conspiracy that gives new meaning to the phrase &ldquo;too big to fail.&rdquo;  The events in it are current and happening, but it has characters you will recognize and feel you know well, and a breakneck ending you will not see coming.So I always think-- how different my life would have been if my draft ofHydrahad sold. I&rsquo;d probably be back in the apparel business now!A Q&amp;A with Andrew GrossHow did you get the idea forReckless?Like all my books, it's never one idea but a series of elements that knit together into a story line. In 2007, a horrible triple murder took place in Cheshire, Connecticut, where a an affluent surgeon's family was tortured and killed right in their country home, and it sent a chill through me and many people I know&mdash;not just the depravity of it, but the terrifying sense of violation and invasion for parents and kids who feel illusorily protected by their successful lives. That this sort of tragedy could never find their way to their door.Around a year later I was flying home from a weekend in Florida when a friend, who happened to be on the plane and sitting a row behind me, leaned forward and said&mdash;\"Bear Stearns just collapsed.\"To me, these words contained a similar profound historical importance as watching the trade towers come down, or the dismantling of the Berlin wall. A tsunami of events greater than society&rsquo;s ability to restrain it.  Something unimaginable happening before my eyes. I wanted to write a book about the sinister aspects of Wall Street as it connects to our government balanced against the personal stories of people who feel trapped and victim to events beyond their control&mdash;events they might have had a hand in making. So I combined the two events&mdash;one tragic, one stunning, the personal with the sensational, and that&rsquo;s howRecklesswas born.How has Ty Hauck&rsquo;s character changed over the past few books? What other changes do you foresee for him?Well, when I first wrote him I had no idea he&rsquo;d be with us for a while&mdash;three books. I will take a brief vacation from him on the next. What I love about Ty is that at heart he's a true romantic with his feet in the real world. He's a white knight, a true soul, in a world of questionable motives, who sees life in a simple, moral way and is willing to put himself at great risk and go up against the hegemonies of power and force that are way beyond his reach at first to penetrate or to dig out the truth. And usually it&rsquo;s a kind of \"quest\" or \"labor\" for a woman he loves. In this shifting and usually disappointing world, he is someone who doesn&rsquo;t disappoint, who you can count on to do the right thing. To me, that is very much at the heart of what being a hero in today&rsquo;s world means.Recklessis your fourth solo novel. What changes have you undergone as a writer from your first forays into fiction to this book?Well, my chapters have gotten a shade longer. But not too much so, I always fight my urges to let more texture in the books, let scenes develop more gradually with the commitment that I owe my readers a fast and gripping read. I think there is a deeper sense of personal motive in my books now than before. They&rsquo;re richer. I don&rsquo;t want to do things just for speed&mdash;as I did with Patterson or perhaps even inThe Blue Zone, which of course, has a great father/daughter dynamic which is about as \"textured\" as you can get. I&rsquo;ve pushed back against the melodramatic more&mdash;but then again&mdash;a little melodrama is always good, critics aside. I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m stumbling. Always hate to try and define my own work. It&rsquo;s better left to others to decide.Why do you write thrillers?I like to write books which engage readers with a sense of real life characters thrown into danger&mdash;I like the speed of film and the actions of heroes. And I guess I like the delivery of information in a manner that breeds suspense. So I guess I&rsquo;m a thriller guy. But I would like to write more of a generational, family story about the garment business, in the manner ofThe Godfather&mdash;if my publisher will let me one day.John Irving knows the last sentence of his novels and then works back to the beginning. What is your writing process?Well, I outline upfront. These days, about half the book, enough to get myself deep into the plot and the initial characters and to know what's at stake. And to get my publisher engaged with the next book. Then I always try to stay around ten chapters ahead of where I am. I&rsquo;m not a believer in the story leading me&mdash;mystery/thrillers have to be well thought out, like business strategies and puzzles, otherwise you can find yourself down some alleys you don&rsquo;t want to be. I want to control the story--frankly it&rsquo;s my mortgage that&rsquo;s at stake, not my characters'. But truth is, there are always changes and three a.m. epiphanies that completely change course. I may wake up and throw two people in bed together and say, \"it&rsquo;s time, get at it\"&mdash;or I may wake up and kill someone off who just the last night was safe. That&rsquo;s what happened with the mom inThe Blue Zone&mdash;I just woke up and said, \"sorry!!!\"What writers do you admire?Not necessarily in my genre: Cormac McCarthy for his extraordinary prose; Thomas Harris for his bad guys; Harlan Coben for his ordinary heroes; early Robert Stone for his complexity; Robert Wilson for his amazing African thrillers; Elmore Leonard for his dialogue and minor characters; James Lee Burke for his rich humanity; Patterson for how to move a story and for teaching me the trade. I&rsquo;m sure I&lsquo;m forgetting a few.Can you give readers an idea of what&rsquo;s coming next from the pen of Andrew Gross?We had a little tragedy in our family this past year. My twenty-one year old nephew committed suicide&mdash;jumped off a cliff. And as we writers do, we make sense of terrible events like this by weaving our own story around it, so I&rsquo;m going back to a family story&mdash;much like in the way ofThe Blue Zone&mdash;about a successful brother who has to solve his unsuccessful brother&rsquo;s only son&rsquo;s death. Should be a good one, I think. At least it&rsquo;s one that is good for me.",

But James Scott&rsquo;s debut, while thrilling, is set in rural upstate New York c: 1900. It tells the story of a mother and son who set off for a rough, rural town in search of the killers who murdered their family; there, they make some discoveries, all right--not just about the criminals, but also about their own damaged selves. This debut is not for the faint of heart--look for reviews that compare it to the work of Cormac (The Road) McCarthy. But it will grab you from the first line--&ldquo;Elspeth Howell was a sinner&rdquo;--and haunt you well past the discovery that Elspeth&rsquo;s sins are both lesser and greater than you first thought. This is one profound and disturbing book from a writer to watch. --Sara Nelson",

Yet the 120GB system manages to improve on this with its 45nm version of the processor, which although running at the same 60+nm speed as previous PS3 versions, uses less energy. This makes the unit's smaller size and quieter fan possible. Along with the traditional AV and composite connections, the 120GB system also boasts an HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) port, which delivers uncompressed, unconverted digital picture and sound to compatible high-definition TVs and projectors. (The system is capable of 128-bit pixel precision and 1080p resolution for a full HD experience) This console also provides for an extreme sound experience by supporting Dolby Digital 5.1, DTS 5.1, as well as Linear PCM 7.1. Finally, it features cross connectivity with your PC network and PlayStation Portable (PSP) and its pre-installed, 120GB hard disc drive allows you to save games as well as download content from The Internet.

        "0061430234": "Cheney, a former L.A. entertainment lawyer, pointedly dispels expectations of a safe ride through this turbulent account of bipolar disorder. With evocative imagery&mdash;time-shuffled recollections meant to mirror her disorienting extremes of mood&mdash;Cheney conjures life at the mercy of a brain chemistry that yanks her from soul-starving despair to raucous exuberance, impetuous pursuits to paralyzing lethargy. Caught in a riptide of febrile impulse, she caroms from seductions to suicide attempts while flirting recklessly with men, danger and death, only to find more hazards in the drastic side effects of treatment. More than a train-wreck tearjerker, the memoir draws strength from salient observations that expose the frustrations of bipolar disorder, from its brutal sabotage of romance and friendship to the challenge it poses to the simplest emotions, such as the terrors of being happy that augur mania's onset. Though she sustains an ominous mood and relays horrifying incidents with icy candor, Cheney lightens up at times, as when she marvels at the ease of masking her condition at an office that brings out everyone's manic side. But the narrative hopscotch frustrates readers' need for grounding and context that might clear up Cheney's muddled history and satisfy readers' urge to learn the fallout of her impulse-driven episodes. Her startlingly lucid descriptions of illness merit a more concise chronology.(Feb.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",
        "0061998885": "Prayers for Rainis Dennis Lehane's fifth installment in his intricately plotted, beautifully written, and much underacknowledged Boston mystery series. Lehane's books reflect our morally complex times, when the borders between right and wrong are somewhat blurry.Private investigator Patrick Kenzie is in the middle of a personal crisis--he's lost his passion for the profession, and is tired of people with their \"predictable vices, their predictable needs and wants and dormant desires.\" Angie Gennaro, his occasional sweetheart, lifelong friend, and fellow investigator has quit the business. She's still deeply resentful about Patrick's handling of the Amanda McCready case, the focus ofGone, Baby, Gone. Without Angie, private investigating has lost its fizz.The suicide of a former client, Karen Nichols, gives Kenzie his investigative itch back. Six months earlier, Kenzie tracked down a stalker who had been harassing Nichols, and put an end to his heinous hobby. But Nichols needed more help than this PI could ever have imagined. \"She'd been drowning, and I'd been busy.\" The successful, middle-class young woman had been sinking into a sea of drugs, alcohol, and prostitution, hitting the bottom when she jumped from the Boston Custom House. Her death consumes Kenzie--he is convinced that someone pulled her into the vortex, although her nearest and dearest simply call her weak.Kenzie teams up with his explosive, loving, gun-toting friend Bubba Rogowski, and, after a boozy reunion, Angie Gennaro joins them. This fearless threesome must surely be the most original team in contemporary crime fiction. Good at the core--but seriously screwed up by various demons from their pasts--tact and decorum is hardly their style. They work their way across Boston, doing whatever it takes to question Nichols's family and acquaintances. By unveiling the real Nichols, tragic family secrets, betrayals, and conspiracies are also unmasked.If you haven't experienced Dennis Lehane's world before, be prepared for an invigorating new reading experience.--Naomi Gesinger--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

As the samurai Samanosuke,  players volunteer to rescue the kidnapped princess Yuki. No surprise  that the ultimate goal (and the entire story line, for that matter)  falls by the wayside as hordes of demons converge on the player hour  after hour. The weapons system benefits from the flashy graphics--as  players discover and add gems to a gauntlet, weapon upgrades increase  firepower with increasingly dramatic effects.Graphically, the game is stunning. Carving through the levels--forests,  tunnels, and the requisite dark, dank castle environment--isn't  anything less than a spectacular experience, thanks much in part to the  game's unusually high production values. Character models are built  from up to 10,000 polygons each--high detail, even for a PS2 game.  Subtle environmental effects--the wind flowing through the trees, for  instance, ripples the fabric in characters' clothes--furthers the  game's realism. The game's backgrounds are painstakingly detailed and  nicely enhanced by dynamic lighting effects.The talent behind the aural effects is just as impressive. Japanese  actor Takeshi Kaneshiro lent his voice to the main character, and a  200-piece orchestra delivers a dramatic score.Call over any PS2 skeptics in your neighborhood, then load upOnimusha: Warlords.

Indeed, while Michael Stirling, dubbed the Merry Rake, is charming enough, subdued Francesca Bridgerton rarely seems worthy of his pursuit. All is well at the novel's outset, aside from the fact that Michael covets his cousin, the Earl of Kilmartin's, wife. Then, barely two chapters into the book, his cousin suffers an aneurysm and dies. Devastated and unable to cope with his new position as earl and his feelings for Francesca, Michael flees to India for four years, only to return still very much in love and suffering from malaria. In London, the two attend social events, trade quips and try to restore their friendship, but the more intimate they become, the more their feelings of guilt gnaw at them. Guilt is the only thing that stands in the way of the couple's happiness, and it's often frustrating to witness their slow, overwrought progression from denial to acceptance. While this book possesses some of the qualities that Quinn's fans have come to expect&mdash;sprightly prose, feverish love scenes and well-developed secondary characters&mdash;it is weighed down by the sheer intensity of the protagonists' grief.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The final book in Cass's \"Selection\" series begins in the midst of a rebel attack on the palace. The heroine, America, is one of four remaining ladies competing in the selection process in this dystopian saga. Through bravery and a strong character, America has won the people's hearts. However, the king continues doing everything in his power to undermine her opportunities to succeed. While the contestants are competing for Maxon's heart, many other events from the outside world transpire: America's father dies and leaves her a letter, she is shot visiting rebels outside the city, the relationship between Aspen and America shifts, and the Southern rebels begin attacking people in the castles. All the while, the protagonist continues to fall deeply in love with Maxon even though he is involved with her competition. Fans of this series will not be disappointed by the ending.

Patrick Kenzie knows he did the right thing twelve years ago (during the events inGone, Baby, Gone) when he located missing 4-year-old Amanda McCready and returned her to her neglectful mother, even though she would&#x2019;ve been better off with her kidnappers.  That doesn&#x2019;t mean he&#x2019;s had an easy time living with his decision.  InMoonlight Mile, Patrick is still scraping by as a freelance PI, but now he&#x2019;s married to his former partner Angie Gennaro and with a daughter of his own.  When Patrick learns that once again Amanda McCready&#x2019;s gone missing, his conscience gets the better of him and he's soon on the trail of the enigmatic 16-year-old, only to discover that the moral complexity of his work has not lessened with time.  And neither has Lehane's talent as a top-notch crime writer.

Massoud Amir Behrani, a former colonel in the Iranian military under the Shah, reflects on his  job-search efforts since arriving in the U.S. four years before: \"I have spent hundreds of dollars copying my credentials; I have worn my French suits and my Italian shoes to hand-deliver my qualifications; I have waited and then called back after the correct waiting time; but there is nothing.\"  The father of two, Behrani has spent most of the money he brought with him from Iran on an apartment and furnishings that are too expensive, desperately trying to keep up appearances in order to enhance his daughter's chances of making a good marriage.

        "0060593083": "InQuicksilver, the first volume of the \"Baroque Cycle,\" Neal Stephenson launches his most ambitious work to date. The novel, divided into three books, opens in 1713 with the ageless Enoch Root seeking Daniel Waterhouse on the campus of what passes for MIT in eighteenth-century Massachusetts. Daniel, Enoch's message conveys, is key to resolving an explosive scientific battle of preeminence between Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz over the development of calculus. As Daniel returns to London aboard theMinerva, readers are catapulted back half a century to recall his years at Cambridge with young Isaac. Daniel is a perfect historical witness. Privy to Robert Hooke's early drawings of microscope images and with associates among the English nobility, religious radicals, and the Royal Society, he also befriends Samuel Pepys, risks a cup of coffee, and enjoys a lecture on Belgian waffles and cleavage-&#x97;all before the year 1700.In the second book, Stephenson introduces Jack Shaftoe and Eliza. \"Half-Cocked\" Jack (also know as the \"King of the Vagabonds\") recovers the English Eliza from a Turkish harem. Fleeing the siege of Vienna, the two journey across Europe driven by Eliza's lust for fame, fortune, and nobility. Gradually, their circle intertwines with that of Daniel in the third book of the novel.The book courses with Stephenson's scholarship but is rarely bogged down in its historical detail. Stephenson is especially impressive in his ability to represent dialogue over the evolving worldview of seventeenth-century scientists and enliven the most abstruse explanation of theory. Though replete with science, the novel is as much about the complex struggles for political ascendancy and the workings of financial markets. Further, the novel's literary ambitions match its physical size. Stephenson narrates through epistolary chapters, fragments of plays and poems, journal entries, maps, drawings, genealogic tables, and copious contemporary epigrams. But, caught in this richness, the prose is occasionally neglected and wants editing. Further, anticipating a cycle, the book does not provide a satisfying conclusion to its 900 pages. These are minor quibbles, though. Stephenson has matched ambition to execution, and his faithful, durable readers will be both entertained and richly rewarded with a practicum in Baroque science, cypher, culture, and politics.--Patrick O'Kelley--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

She strides through centuries, past acres of novels, histories, biographies, and plays--even past Henry himself--confident in the knowledge that to recast history's most mercurial sovereign, it's not the King she needs to see, but one of the King's most mysterious agents. Enter Thomas Cromwell, a self-made man and remarkable polymath who ascends to the King's right hand. Rigorously pragmatic and forward-thinking, Cromwell has little interest in what motivates his Majesty, and although he makes way for Henry's marriage to the infamous Anne Boleyn, it's the future of a free England that he honors above all else and hopes to secure. Mantel plots with a sleight of hand, making full use of her masterful grasp on the facts without weighing down her prose. The opening cast of characters and family trees may give initial pause to some readers, but persevere: the witty, whip-smart lines volleying the action forward may convince you a short stay in the Tower of London might not be so bad... provided you could bring a copy ofWolf Hallalong. --Anne Bartholomew--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

        "0060817089": "Labrador retrievers are generally considered even-tempered, calm and reliable;and then there's Marley, the subject of this delightful tribute to one Lab who doesn't fit the mold. Grogan, a columnist for thePhiladelphia Inquirer, and his wife, Jenny, were newly married and living in West Palm Beach when they decided that owning a dog would give them a foretaste of the parenthood they anticipated. Marley was a sweet, affectionate puppy who grew into a lovably naughty, hyperactive dog. With a light touch, the author details how Marley was kicked out of obedience school after humiliating his instructor (whom Grogan calls Miss Dominatrix) and swallowed an 18-karat solid gold necklace (Grogan describes his gross but hilarious \"recovery operation\"). With the arrival of children in the family, Marley became so incorrigible that Jenny, stressed out by a new baby, ordered her husband to get rid of him; she eventually recovered her equilibrium and relented. Grogan's chronicle of the adventures parents and children (eventually three) enjoyed with the overly energetic but endearing dog is delivered with great humor. Dog lovers will love this account of Grogan's much loved canine.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

        "0062105620": "*Starred Review* Internationally revered for her truth-seeking historical fiction, Allende takes on the present with equal bewitchment and intensity. As Maya&#x2019;s grandmother, Nidia, sends her into protective custody on Chilo&#xE9;, an island off Chile&#x2019;s southern coast, she hands her a notebook in which this imperiled and irascible 19-year-old records her wrenching story. Fair and tall, Maya does not resemble her Chilean side, neither her absentee pilot father nor tough-love Berkeley activist Nidia, but, rather, her Danish flight-attendant mother, who left her newborn with her in-laws. To further complicate matters, Maya&#x2019;s guiding light was her grandfather, Nidia&#x2019;s second husband, a wise and loving African American astronomer. It is his death that precipitates the &#x201C;voyage to the underworld&#x201D; of addiction, crime, and homelessness that nearly kills her. Maya alternates between recounting her past and reporting on her gradual acclimation to Chilo&#xE9;, a microcosm of Chile&#x2019;s cultural and spiritual splendor and traumatic and tragic history. Every character is enthralling, including Manuel, the all-but-monastic anthropologist and political exile who takes Maya in; Freddy, the young junkie Maya meets in Las Vegas; and the &#x201C;good witches,&#x201D; who restore her sense of worth. This is a boldly plotted, sharply funny, and purposefully bone-shaking novel of sexual violence, political terror, &#x201C;collective shame,&#x201D; and dark family secrets, all transcended by courage and love.

Featuring detailed environments and complicated new battle mechanisms, this game demands a different kind of perspective than the first-person shooters from the original Halo series. You'll need to uncover the hidden strengths and weaknesses of each unit and play them to your tactical advantage, and that's just the beginning.UNSC: Be Part of a Legendary ConflictThe story opens with UNSC forces retaking the planet Harvest from the Covenant. At your disposal -- should you choose to take command of UNSC forces -- will be everything from a corps of highly-trained Marines to the Warthogs, Scorpions, and Hornets you'll need for air and land attacks. You'll take stock of the map and decide between holding your ground or advancing on enemy strongholds, all while trying to navigate the local terrain and outsmart Covenant forces. And when you need something extra to tip the tide in your favor, UNSC leaders can provide you with the ability to mobilize highly specialized units or call the Spirit of Fire vessel for support from above.Covenant: A Capable, Playable Enemy FactionThat's right, Covenant is playable in this corner of the Halo universe. This alliance of alien species has manipulated advanced technology, firepower, and tactical prowess into a powerful force that is engaged in a Genocidal war against human race, having branded humans as heretics. With the ability to play as these tough, alien fighters, you'll have advanced shield technology, the modular Citadel at the heart of Covenant's colonizing power, and, of course, the iconic Scarab attack vehicle at your disposal, adding a whole new dimension to your strategic warfare. The Scarab is a terrifying military vehicle crafted from heavy mining equipment. And with a mining laser that delivers massive damage across battlefields large and small, turrets for taking on air attacks, and the ability to clamber over any terrain, what's not to love about commanding Scarabs instead of fighting against them?Developed Exclusively for Xbox 360Most console RTS games are adapted from existing PC games, which can make their controls bulky or awkward, butHalo Warshas been developed for Xbox 360 from the ground up. This means the controls are sensitive, intuitive, and easy-to-operate in the midst of battle. And the UI is just as intuitive, so whether you're managing a unit of marines or a deadly machine, you can focus on creating a battle strategy instead of worrying about how to overcome a clumsy controller.No matter which faction you choose to play as, you can test your skills against those of other players in online skirmishes that allow up to six players with the New Xbox Experience through Xbox LIVE.",

        "B0002B90SA": "Smug Statement: The Sith Lords is smart, deep, dark, and stands as the best thing to happen to Star Wars since Timothy Zahn penned the extraordinary Heir to the Empire trilogy. Much like a Padawan learning the ways of the Force from a Jedi Master, Obsidian Entertainment has embraced the teachings of BioWare, built upon the original formula, and forged a powerful sequel that will take your breath away faster than Vader ever&#xA0;could.In the five years that have passed since the fall of Lord Malak, the Dark Side of the Force has spread across the galaxy like a disease. Sith Lord attacks have devastated the Old Republic, and the Jedi guardians are on the verge of extinction. The Republic's only hope of survival lies within your uncertain hands. Awakening in a battle-damaged vessel that is spinning uncontrollably through an asteroid field, you have no recollection of your past, yet you can feel the Force flowing through your veins. Will you side with the Republic and battle the Sith scourge? Or will you fade into darkness and let evil reign?This compelling introduction pulls you into the plot, keeping you completely transfixed as you tip the scales between the light and dark and scour the cosmos for clues that will unearth your enigmatic past. The tale is paced to perfection and never once feels like it is making unnecessary detours to lengthen the experience.From HK-47's amusing \"droid prejudice\" banter to Kreia's cryptic messages, the game is overflowing with fascinating personalities and some of the most believable characters to ever be brought to life in a game. Again, pacing is used expertly to develop relationships with the player. As the plot unfolds, you'll be forced to decide who to trust, who to keep close, and who to keep a watchful eye on. When you communicate with your allies, your choice of words will affect your standing with them. If you have a high enough influence over them, they may open up to you and follow your ways (be it light or&#xA0;dark).The game also dives deeper into Star Wars lore as it utilizes a much wider selection of alien species, weapons, and gear, as well as planets that we really haven't seen much of in the movies or games. Obsidian can also be commended for creating not one, but two of the most fearsome and awe-inspiring nemeses in the Star Wars universe. Discovering who these Sith Lords are is another of the games exciting mysteries.On the gameplay front, Obsidian stuck to the formula of the original game, but has built upon it with little additions and subtle tweaks. Of course, this still means that your supporting party will blindly run over a clearly visible mine, load times are just as extensive, some of the loose ends in the plot are not tied up (what's up with the HK droids?), and slowdown occurs when too many characters engage in battle. In short it still has its annoyances, yet the new material more than makes up for them. As you engage in conversation, you can now tap into your skills to add a new level of persuasion. For instance, if your character is knowledgeable to the subject matter, you may be prompted with an awareness option. Another interesting addition is the ability to break down items into components that you can turn around and use to create a wide variety of things.The missions that you'll undertake are just as varied, and the consequences to your actions can be just as cataclysmic. A raised level cap won't stunt your characters growth this time around, and the variety that stems from the new character interactions only heightens the reasons to play this game numerous times. Many of the visuals are a bit underwhelming, but the detail in the facial modeling is much more defined, and you won't see as many unintentional identical twins throughout your&#xA0;journey.It's almost impossible to deny the charms that emerge from this title's expertly crafted story and unbound freedom. The Sith Lords is a crowning accomplishment for video games and one of the finest Star Wars stories ever told.Concept:A Star Wars mystery set in the old times that offers up a fantastic story and role-playing blissGraphics:Better facial models, but the environments are still bland and slowdown does occurSound:The score fits perfectly into Star Wars canon, and the character dialogue is some of the best to datePlayability:The same engine with a few enhancements around the edges. Influencing characters and making items are done wellEntertainment:You absolutely have to play it twice to see where the story goes for light and darkReplay:HighRated:9.25 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:February 20052nd Opinion:The call of The Sith Lords is impossible to resist. Embracing the dark side, I twisted an apprentice to my corrupt will, polluted the Force with senseless slaughter, and was told by my loyal HK unit that I was like \"a delightful random cruelty generator.\" Even more than its predecessor, The Sith Lords provides countless opportunities for players to revel in the aftermath of their own choices. Essentially, anyone who said that Obsidian couldn't live up to the standards set by BioWare's first installment should be stuffing their mouths full of Bantha fodder right about now. Every exemplary aspect of KOTOR has actually been improved through expanded dialogue options, tons of alignment-specific variables, and a more engaging story. Honestly, I want to give this game an even higher score, but I just can't ignore the multitude of technical problems (like pathfinding and battle glitches) and certain key plot point omissions. Regardless, despite the imperfections, The Sith Lords crushes the feeble windpipes of any other RPG of 2004.Rated:9 out of 10Editor:Joe JubaSubscribe to Game Informer",

As a private in the Russian army, you will fight off waves of invading German troops and Panzer tanks in Moscow and Stalingrad. Once you finish the Russian campaign, you'll go up against Field Marshal Rommel's troops in the deserts of North Africa. As part of this campaign, you'll race around in your own tank with others at your side, and later you'll be tasked with calling in air strikes against enemy tanks. The final campaign has you in the role of an American corporal in Europe, but unlike most WWII games, you won't perform a D-Day landing on Omaha or Utah Beach. InCall of Duty 2, you have to scale the cliffs of Pointe du Hoc with the Army Rangers amidst a hail of artillery and machine gun fire, giving you a true appreciation of the time-honored saying, \"War is Hell!\"Call of Duty 2is a thinking-gamer's first-person shooter of medium difficulty. While there are many reflexive elements, the game quite often requires you to consider the tactics of the situation in order to survive. While you can probably blow through the game in 10 hours on the regular setting, the more difficult settings require you to be much more thoughtful about your approach to the different scenarios. Your teammates in battle neither finish your fight, nor simply provide enemy fodder, while the enemy AI (artificial intelligence) is quite clever. If you are too meek, you will find yourself pinned down by aggressive fire while the enemy lobs grenades at you until you're decimated.Unlike the its predecessor,Call of Duty 2doesn't give you a health bar. Instead, as you are hit by more and more fire, your screen grows increasingly red around the border, and your character begins to grunt and pant. This is your signal that it's time to find some cover in order to recuperate before you continue. Another major improvement is the enhanced smoke grenades, which not only look great but can be used effectively in battle to obscure your path from tanks or machine-gun nests as you make your way to an objective.WhileCall of Duty 2has received an ESRB T (teen) rating -- meaning there are no gratuitous blood and guts splashing all over the screen -- this is still war, and there are enemies that will try to drag themselves to safety after being hit, only to be bludgeoned to a screaming death by your fellow men-at-arms. And like its older brother,Call of Duty 2offers the standard deathmatch, team deathmatch, capture-the-flag, and search-and-destroy multiplayer modes. However, this version offers a new option called \"headquarters,\" which most closely resembles the \"crazy king\" version of king-of-the-hill in Halo 2. Shifting headquarter points appear and must be captured in order to start building points, only to be overrun by the other side in order to halt that point gain. This version of the multiplayer mode is not only extremely fun, but it requires teams to adapt on the fly.Unlike the original, in this sequel you can skip forward from one mission to the next once you've cleared a campaign. The game also auto-detects 16:9 and 16:10 wide-screen ratios, as well as the sometimes tricky 5:4 ratio for LCD monitors. As the user, you can make use of a good set of performance tweaking functions, or you can allow the game to determine the optimal ratio, based on your system. With the addition of actual war footage as introductions to each campaign, and famous war quotes at the end of the scenes,Call of Duty 2has everything you need to lose yourself in the middle of the biggest war in history of the world.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

        "0064408639": "As the three Baudelaire orphans warily approach their new home--Prufrock  Preparatory School--they can't help but notice the enormous stone arch bearing  the school's mottoMemento Mori, or \"Remember you will die.\" This is not  a cheerful greeting, and certainly marks an inauspicious beginning to a very  bleak story. Of course, this is what we have come to expect from Lemony  Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events, the deliciously morbid set of books that  began withThe Bad  Beginningand only got worse.InThe Austere Academy, Violet, Klaus, and Sunny are at first  optimistic--attending school is a welcome change for the book-loving trio, and  the academy is allegedly safe from the dreaded Count Olaf, who is after their  fortune. Hope dissipates quickly, however, when they meet Vice Principal Nero, a  self-professed genius violinist who sneeringly imitates their every word. More  dreadful still, he houses them in the tin Orphans Shack, crawling with  toe-biting crabs and dripping with a mysterious tan fungus. A beam of light  shines through the despair when the Baudelaires meet the Quagmires, two of three  orphaned triplets who are no strangers to disaster and sympathize with their  predicament. When Count Olaf appears on the scene disguised as Coach Genghis  (covering his monobrow with a turban and his ankle tattoo with expensive running  shoes), the Quagmires resolve to come to the aid of their new friends. Sadly,  this proves to be a hideous mistake.Snicket disarms us again with his playful juxtapositions--only he can compare  bombs with strawberry shortcake (both are as dangerous to make as assumptions),  muse on how babies adjust developmentally to the idea of curtains, or ponder why  the Baudelaire orphans would not want to be stalks of celery despite their  incessant bad luck as humans. We can't get enough of this splendid series of  misadventures, and can only wager that swarms of young readers will be right  next to us in line for the next installment.

        "0060557559": "Set in Manchester County, Virginia, 20 years before the Civil War began, Edward P. Jones's debut novel,The Known World, is a masterpiece of overlapping plot lines, time shifts, and heartbreaking details of life under slavery. Caldonia Townsend is an educated black slaveowner, the widow of a well-loved young farmer named Henry, whose parents had bought their own freedom, and then freed their son, only to watch him buy himself a slave as soon as he had saved enough money. Although a fair and gentle master by the standards of the day, Henry Townsend had learned from former master about the proper distance to keep from one's property. After his death, his slaves wonder if Caldonia will free them. When she fails to do so, but instead breaches the code that keeps them separate from her, a little piece of Manchester County begins to unravel. Impossible to rush through,The Known Worldis a complex, beautifully written novel with a large cast of characters, rewarding the patient reader with unexpected connections, some reaching into the present day.--Regina Marler--This text refers to theHardcoveredition.",

        "0061002860": "This novel, written in 1927, is considered the best and most successful of the early mysteries. It met with no small outrage when it appeared, as it uses a plot device many readers thought \"unfair.\" There is a full complement of characters populating the cozy English village of King's Abbot: Major Blunt, Colonel Carter, Miss Gannett, the butler, the housekeeper, the narrator, Dr. Sheppard, and his know-it-all sister (the precursor of Miss Marple, according to Christie), and, of course, the redoubtable Hercule Poirot and his little grey cells. There are clues with a capital C to mislead us, and the listener gets so involved with these red herrings (or not) that the very simple truth eludes the puzzler.

        "0064401324": "Grade 3-6-Two delightful short books by John Reynolds Gardiner have been paired up in this audio set. Stone Fox (HarperCollins, 1980) tells the story of a boy determined to win a dog sled race to save his grandfather's farm. No one has ever beaten Stone Fox, an imposing and silent Native American, but little Willy trains daily for the race with his beloved dog, Searchlight. It seems like Willy might even win the race until heartbreaking tragedy strikes. Top Secret (Little, 1984) also features a determined boy and his grandfather, but in a much different setting and story. Allen Brewster has a fantastic idea that might even win the silver trophy at the science fair human photosynthesis. He has several obstacles to overcome. Allen persists in his mission using the scientific method and finally comes up with a concoction that turns him into a human plant. He turns green, craves sunlight and water instead of food, and sprouts baby roots if he stands in mud too long. Everything changes when Allen is deemed a threat to national security and his project is suddenly top secret. Both books are about 20 years old, so the characters do not represent very diverse backgrounds, but the messages of loyalty and determination are timeless. Tony Award winner B. D. Wong narrates the characters to fit the emotion and suspense of each story. The fact that one sentence was left out of the narration of Stone Fox and a few words were dropped from Top Secret might deter purchase of this audiobook for a read-along program. Each story could be listened to for pleasure or as a springboard for classroom discussion.Teresa Wittmann, St. Anthony School, Renton, WACopyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

Would  you expect anything less from the mystery man behind A Series of Unfortunate  Events (The Bad  Beginning,The Ersatz  Elevator, etc.)? Virtually every detail of the volume has Snicket's  indelible mark, from the book jacket (reversible to help readers disguise this  \"extremely dangerous\" and \"objectionable\" autobiography) to the copyright page  text to the intentionally blurry and bewildering black-and-white photographs  appearing throughout. An apparently false obituary for Lemony Snicket sets the  stage for what turns into a series of mind-boggling bundles of coded information  passed from hand to hand, gleaned from newspapers blowing through streets, pages  from a journal addressed to \"Dear Dairy,\" blueprints of ships, minutes from  secret meetings, and a lot of edited and disputed commentary. The question is,  do we finally discover the meaning of VFD? You know you're not going to get a  straight answer. But any fan of Snicket will have a lot of fun trying.

Here she talks with Child about her work on the series, and her enduring interest in the aftermath of WW1.Lee Child:People are often surprised that I'm a huge Maisie Dobbs fan, because Jack Reacher is all about a kind of Spartan American masculinity, and Maisie Dobbs is all about a kind of feminine English refinement.  But they're both strong, unconventional people.  Perhaps that's the cross-genre appeal?  Do you find that Maisie attracts an unusual mix of readers?Jacqueline Winspear:I&rsquo;m thrilled you&rsquo;re such a Maisie Dobbs fan--and you can count me among those millions of Jack Reacher fans.  Maisie and Reacher are both unconventional, but I believe another factor in their cross-genre appeal is that both have endured life-changing challenges.  Maisie attracts diverse readers: men and women, all age groups, veterans, nurses, college students, people who have faced troubles, and people interested in the era.LC:And in fact your novels are driven by violence far worse than mine--off the page, granted, but there&rsquo;s no getting around the fact that at the heart of your books is the aftermath of a horrendous war, with its attendant violence and death.  How do you see the role of violence in your novels?JW:I think you hit the theme there with &ldquo;aftermath.&rdquo;  The violence in my books is that searing, painful residue left by the passing of a terrible time, when people were also crushed emotionally by the deep losses over a four-year period.  In addition, there&rsquo;s that element of violence that lingers--inAmong the Mad, for example--when war&rsquo;s tentacles will not let go.  We see that again today in the stories of veterans who are still fighting their wars, but the conflict is raging inside them.LC:As a kid in England I remember seeing hundreds of maimed old men, and hundreds of lonely old women.  My grandfather was an example of the first, and two great-aunts examples of the second - sad reminders of a terrible time.  Was it something similar that drew you to the First World War and the &ldquo;Between the Wars&rdquo; era that followed?JW:I have the same memories--my grandfather was wounded at the Battle of the Somme, and my grandmother was partially blinded at the Woolwich Arsenal, in an explosion that wounded her sister and killed several girls working alongside her. There were the elderly spinsters in my neighborhood, and for each there was that old sepia photograph on the mantelpiece, of a sweetheart or brother lost to war. Those childhood memories led me to think a lot about what happens after war is done.  As a character says inBirds of a Feather, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the trouble with war; it lives on inside the living.&rdquo;LC:I was introduced to Maisie Dobbs by my wife, who passed through an airport and picked up the first in the series.  She loved it, and urged me to read it, and I'm glad I did.  It's one of the very, very few series we both love equally--in fact, perhaps the only one.  Is this typical of your readers?JW:I receive so many emails from fans who tell me that the books are read by all members of the family. And many women tell me that it was their husband who first discovered Maisie.  The books are as accessible to readers aged about fourteen as they are to seniors. There are few things today that all age groups within a family can engage in, discuss and get excited about, so it&rsquo;s lovely when I hear that family members are awaiting the next book so they can all read it.LC:Maisie is definitively feminine, but she's running a business, and poking around in a \"man's world,\" which is true to the times, and indicative of the early stages of feminism in the West.  Was that something you wanted to explore?JW:It would have been difficult to introduce a character such as Maisie and not explore the fact that the Great War left so many women to forge a life alone.  If there was one thing I wanted to do, it was to bring the spirit of that generation to the character of Maisie Dobbs.  Of course, some women floundered and lived lonely lives, but there were a great many who blazed a trail.  I believe an archetype was born at that time--the stoic British woman who is independent and more than a little opinionated, with a heart of gold under a tough exterior, and who knows what it is to endure.  Dame Maggie Smith has played that character in several films.LC:Maisie understands human psychology in a way that seems to be an early and experimental pre-echo of what we'd now call criminal profiling.  It's a huge part of both her process and her appeal.  Where did that come from?JW:That developed in a very organic way.  Having established her as a &ldquo;sensitive,&rdquo; I wanted to give her real expertise--and there are historical underpinnings to this aspect of her character.  Maisie studied the Moral Sciences curriculum at Girton College when psychology was in its infancy.  I have the prospectus from 1913, and about one third of the course was the study of modern psychology. It was a time of great experimentation, so Maisie&rsquo;s processes have their roots in real practices considered innovative at the time.LC:One of your decisions I admire is the way you have moved the series forward in time so firmly. Most writers would have continued mining the same immediate post-war seam forever.  What was your thinking behind that?  And how do you keep the character fresh as the series itself develops?JW:I once heard you say at a conference, &ldquo;The reader comes back to a series, not to find out what the sleuth does with the case, but what the case does to the sleuth.&rdquo;  I agree.  We are all impacted not only by our past, but by our current circumstances and those around us.  You always put Reacher in a new area, be it small town or big city; and through his wandering we learn a lot about him. I work with the geography of time. Not everyone likes change and many readers would like Maisie Dobbs to stay as she is in a given book.  But life&rsquo;s not like that--the goalposts tend to move when we are at our most comfortable, and I want to keep the series fresh.LC:I&rsquo;m often asked if I have a favorite book within my series, so now I&rsquo;m turning the tables:  Do you have favorites among your novels?JW:That&rsquo;s such a difficult question, because each book not only represents a different place on my journey as a writer, but has been inspired by something that touched me.  I thinkMaisie Dobbswill always be very tightly held in my affections, because it was my first book and was written at a difficult time in my life, when I was recovering from a horrible accident.  The other choice would be TheMapping of Love and Death, because it was inspired by the true story of a soldier whose remains lay under Belgian soil for some 90 years until unearthed by a farmer. I learned more about him when I became involved in the quest to discover his origins.  When I look at that book, I think of a young man lost to war who was never identified and who was eventually laid to rest as &ldquo;A Soldier of The Great War, Known Unto God.&rdquo; I ache for the parents who never knew where their son died, for he had probably been listed as &ldquo;Missing, Presumed Dead.&rdquo;",

Ian Porter is the baritone, thoughtful and deliberative; Adam Sims is lighter spirited, flightier, and more amused by the bizarre comedy of Murakami's puzzle box. Both readers are well chosen, expertly picking their way across the minefield of this intoxicating, perplexing story. And their balancing act mimics the book's alternation of tones, styles, and stories.

McPherson'sBattle Cry of Freedom, one of the better Abraham Lincoln biographies, something on Robert E. Lee, perhaps Shelby Foote's massive trilogyThe Civil War. Add Jay Winik's wonderfulApril 1865to the list. This is one of those rare, shining books that takes a new look at an old subject and changes the way we think about it. Winik shows that there was nothing inevitable about the end of the Civil War, from the fall of Richmond to the surrender at Appomattox to the murder of Lincoln. It all happened so quickly, in what \"proved to be perhaps the most moving and decisive month not simply of the Civil War, but indeed, quite likely, in the life of the United States.\"Things might have been rather different, too. \"What emerges from the panorama of April 1865 is that the whole of our national history could have been altered but for a few decisions, a quirk of fate, a sudden shift in luck.\" When Lee abandoned Richmond, for instance, his soldiers rendezvoused at a nearby town called Amelia Court House. There, the general expected to find boxcars full of food for his hungry troops. But \"a mere administrative mix-up\" left his army empty-handed and may have limited Lee's options in the days to come. Or what if Lee had decided not to surrender at all, but to turn his resourceful army into an outfit of guerrilla fighters who would harass federal officials? National reconciliation might have become impossible as the whole South turned into a region plagued with violence and terrorism. For the Union, \"there would be no real rest, no real respite, no true amity, nor, for that matter, any real sense of victory--only an amorphous state of neither war nor peace, raging like a low-level fever.\" One of Lee's officers actually proposed this scenario to his commander in those final hours; America is fortunate Lee didn't choose this path.Winik is an exceptionally good storyteller.April 1865is full of memorable images and you-are-there writing. Readers will come away with a new appreciation for that momentous month and a sharpened understanding of why and how the Civil War was fought.

She befriends some of the teens at Lyle House and tries to accept her treatment. However, two of her more mysterious housemates suggest that maybe she isn't crazy. Derek tells her to look up necromancy on the Internet, and she finds out that it's the ability to communicate with the spirits of the dead.

There is Madeleine, a self-described &#x201C;incurable romantic&#x201D; who is slightly embarrassed at being so normal. There is Leonard, a brilliant, temperamental student from the Pacific Northwest. And completing the triangle is Mitchell, a Religious Studies major from Eugenides&#x2019; own Detroit. What follows is a book delivered in sincere and genuine prose, tracing the end of the students&#x2019; college days and continuing into those first, tentative steps toward true adulthood.

Victoria Moore, Daily Mail The Bronze Horseman 'Pulling off the passionate love story embedded in a truly epic narrative is a difficult thing to do. Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind remains the blueprint for the genre, while Tolstoy's War and Peace carries off the literary honours ... it's quickly apparent that the Russian-born author Paullina Simons has the measure of this kind of epic romantic saga. The power of her descriptive writing, the vividness of the historical detail and, most of all, the strength of her central characters mark out her novel as a considerable achievement ... she is able to make some powerful statements about the durability of the human spirit, but never at the expense of descriptive passages refulgent with power and beauty' Barry Forshaw, amazon",

This slim volume finds protagonist Joanna and husband Walter and kids leaving the wicked city for the bucolic town of Stepford. Despite its ideal facade, the sleepy little storybook town actually is more wicked. Joanna soon notices that her female neighbors are all body and no brains and seemingly exist only to do housework while their husbands gather nightly at a mysterious men's club. Even worse, it appears that the women who moved there just before her suddenly begin morphing into hausfraus built like swimsuit models-and she's next! It's hard to tell if this is a stab at the feminist movement or simply a male fantasy, but it's a fun read and will keep you turning the pages.

In this respect,The Intelligent Investoris a book for true investors, not speculators or day traders. He provides, \"in a form suitable for the laymen, guidance in adoption and execution of an investment policy\" (1). This policy is inherently for the longer term and requires a commitment of effort. Where the speculator follows market trends, the investor uses discipline, research, and his analytical ability to make unpopular but sound investments in bargains relative to current asset value. Graham coaches the investor to develop a rational plan for buying stocks and bonds, and he argues that this plan must be a bulwark against emotional behavior that will always be tempting during abrupt bull and bear markets.Since it was first published in 1949, Graham's investment guide has sold over a million copies and has been praised by such luminaries as Warren E. Buffet as \"the best book on investing ever written.\" These accolades are well deserved. In its new form--with commentary on each chapter and extensive footnotes prepared by seniorMoneyeditor, Jason Zweig--the classic is now updated in light of changes in investment vehicles and market activities since 1972.

For company Henry has his long-divorced mother, Adele&#8212;a onetime dancer whose summer project was to teach him how to foxtrot; his hamster, Joe; and awkward Saturday-night outings to Friendly's with his estranged father and new stepfamily. As much as he tries, Henry knows that even with his jokes and his \"Husband for a Day\" coupon, he still can't make his emotionally fragile mother happy. Adele has a secret that makes it hard for her to leave their house, and seems to possess an irreparably broken heart.But all that changes on the Thursday before Labor Day, when a mysterious bleeding man named Frank approaches Henry and asks for a hand. Over the next five days, Henry will learn some of life's most valuable lessons: how to throw a baseball, the secret to perfect piecrust, the breathless pain of jealousy, the power of betrayal, and the importance of putting others&#8212;especially those we love&#8212;above ourselves. And the knowledge that real love is worth waiting for.In a manner evoking Ian McEwan'sAtonementand Nick Hornby'sAbout a Boy, acclaimed author Joyce Maynard weaves a beautiful, poignant tale of love, sex, adolescence, and devastating treachery as seen through the eyes of a young teenage boy&#8212;and the man he later becomes&#8212;looking back at an unexpected encounter that begins one single long, hot, life-altering weekend.The Obsessions BehindLabor Day: An Essay by Joyce MaynardI always tell students, when I teach writing, to locate their obsessions, and look to them when they&#x2019;re searching for the story they should be telling. When a writer attaches her work to the engine of what she cares about most passionately (even irrationally, perhaps) the work will be infused with a similar passion, I believe. And come into being most organically.This new novel of mine--though it&#x2019;s a product of my imagination, not my experience--contains elements of so many of my deepest obsessions. I think that&#x2019;s why I wrote it so easily and swiftly--almost as if I were transcribing a story being dictated to me from inside my brain.Anyone who has read my work for a while can recognize a few obvious connections to my history, starting with the experience of having been, for many years, a single parent of sons (also a daughter) living in a small town not unlike the imaginary town in which I located the novel. I like to think I have a somewhat more stable and grounded hold on reality and life in the world than Adele (and I am, if anything, the opposite of agoraphobic). But I share a number of her attributes: For starters, there&#x2019;s a hugely romantic nature and a love of dancing (though not her abilities on the dance floor; that part is the stuff of fantasy.) On a deeper level, though, I understand well the sorrow and regret a woman feels when the dream of family life as she envisioned it has left her. My sons--though I like to think they would weigh in with more positive feelings about their growing up years than negative ones--could certainly identify with the feelings Henry has, of undue responsibility for his mother. (Henry&#x2019;s innocent gift, to Adele, of the Husband-for-a-Day coupon was inspired by a similar gift presented to me one Christmas by my son Charlie, when he was around nine or ten.)I am always interested--no, fascinated--by children&#x2019;s perceptions of the adults in their world. The mysterious subject of sex, the first discovery of one&#x2019;s own sexuality, and the disquieting experience-- for a child of divorced parents in particular--of witnessing a parent&#x2019;s sexuality even as they embark on their own sexual lives. Complicated enough, when a child is contemplating the idea of his parents together--but the experience for a young person (a boy in particular) of seeing his mother with some other man is one I have thought about for a long time. (Ever since my son Willy--then age seven--responded to my going out on a date for the first time, after separating from his father, by taking a kitchen knife and plunging it directly into the crotch of a cardboard effigy of the country singer Randy Travis that I had propped up in our front hall . . . Willy is now 24 by the way. A very healthy person who displays no signs of being a psychopath.)Back to the obsession list. My experience of having gone through a painful custody battle many years ago--and the horrifying experience of being evaluated as a mother by a guardian ad litem--is in there. My history as a teenage girl with eating disorders also surfaced in this story, along with the guilt I carry about a betrayal I committed--at around that time in life--of a classmate&#x2019;s trust in me, when around age fourteen--an event that formed the basis for the first story I ever published in a magazine (Seventeen), somewhere around 1970 . . .Another experience that found its way into this novel (and one I also wrote about, in non-fiction form, a few years back) was a kind of fantasy love affair I found myself in, when I was myself a young and very lonely single mother, living in a small New Hampshire town with my three young children, and I got a letter (first one, then a hundred more) from a man in prison, who seemed to know and understand me better than anyone else. (I eventually learned--when it appeared he was getting out of prison and coming to visit my children and me--that this man was a double murderer. I first told the story at The Moth in New York, and later wrote it in an essay that appeared in Vogue, and in a collection published a few years back, calledMr. Wrong.)I will add here, that this is the third time in which I have chosen, for the central character of a novel of mine, a character who is thirteen years old. This is clearly an age that means a lot to me, and though I haven&#x2019;t been thirteen for many decades, I still feel very connected to that time of life.One odd little obsession that I included in the novel, with particular pleasure, concerns pie. Ever since the death of my mother, nineteen years ago, I have set myself the task of teaching pie-making to anyone I encounter who expresses frustration with making good crust--and the numbers of my past students have long since entered the triple digits. (I have also often run large gatherings of pie students at my home, to raise money for my political candidate. Always a Democrat . . .) I could talk a lot about what this pie exercise means to me--certainly it has to do with my mother, but also with honoring the old ways of doing things by hand, and paying attention to instinct (more than a recipe). And I have to add, I love it that I was able to include, in a work of fiction, instructions for making a pie crust that really will result in a good pie, if followed.The final obsession I will mention here--and it is the one that inspired my first novel,Baby Love, twenty-eight years ago--is babies. Although I am very different from Adele in many ways, the way she feels about having a baby is how I felt all my life. And what Frank says concerning the importance of paying attention to babies--and later, his thoughts are echoed by Henry, when he becomes a parent of a daughter--is everything I believe, myself. I have never met a baby I didn&#x2019;t like, or a crying baby I didn&#x2019;t feel I could bring to a state of calm. I just like babies a whole lot, and loved writing about that part here.I want to add: I did not intentionally set out to address any of these topics. They just came out, because they&#x2019;re all the things that interest me most. No doubt this is why I loved writing this novel and wrote it so fast. (I could not stop writing.) I wanted to read it.",

When she injures her arm in an accident, she discovers a network of wires and tubes beneath her skin that hints at a history more incredible than she could have ever imagined. Mila doesn't remember her previous life because she doesn't have a past: she was created in a top-secret laboratory for the government. Now she and her mother are running for their lives and nothing makes sense-all she has are questions. Who is her mother? Did her father ever actually exist? Why was she created? And who is chasing her? In this cross between Robert Ludlum's The Bourne Identity (Richard Marek, 1980) and Mary E. Pearson's The Adoration of Jenna Fox (Holt, 2008), Mila's identity crisis and the resulting questions about what it means to be human could be the start of an interesting discussion.

While this might seem like a no-brainer, Prose (Blue Angel;A Changed Man) masterfully meditates on how quality reading informs great writing, which will warm the cold, jaded hearts of even the most frustrated, unappreciated and unpublished writers. Chapters treat the nuts and bolts of writing (words, sentences, paragraphs) as well as issues of craft (narration, character, dialogue), all of which Prose discusses using story or novel excerpts. This is where the book truly shines; Prose is remarkably egalitarian in choosing exemplars of fiction: David Gates, Denis Johnson, John le Carr&eacute; and ZZ Packer, for instance, are considered as seriously as Chekhov, Melville, Flaubert or Babel. Prose insists that \"literature not only breaks the rules, but makes us realize that thereare none,\" and urges writers to re-read the classics (Chekhov, especially) and view \"reading as something that might move or delight you.\" Prose's guide to reading and writing belongs on every writer's bookshelf alongside E.M.

Rachel enjoys cocaine, alcohol and meeting men in bars, especially men wearing tight leather pants. She can match anybody's hilarious anecdotes about a Catholic childhood, but recently her life's gone awry, and God has become \"more like a celestial stand-up comic\" than a \"benign old guy with long hair.\" When she wakes up in a hospital emergency room and finds she's been diagnosed as a suicidal drug addict, she's enraged. She's also broke and unemployed, and her boyfriend has abandoned her. As a final indignity, her father takes her back home and books her into Dublin's Betty Ford-like clinic, the Cloisters. Famous for a clientele of rock stars, it should be a glamorous spa, but it isn't. Quarters are spartan, clients do housework and group therapy is humiliating. It could be worse, though, and there's one good-looking fellow-inmate who might, or might not, be a lifeline post-Cloisters. This novel isn't a how-to on overcoming addiction but an examination, often comic, of treatment that is expected to result in personality changes necessary for recovery. Smart-ass Rachel actually becomes a beguiling heroine after learning to wake up and cook eggs at about the same time in the morning she used to fall into somebody's bed in New York. Clever badinage (\"the only way to get over one man is get under another\") unfortunately sometimes gives way to phrases like \"pantie-meltingly gorgeous.\" The narrative is overlong, and the characters rarely speakAthey yell or shriekAbut, overall, Keyes's stylish wit keeps readers attentive, and her take on addiction is insightful and compassionate.

His latest focuses on the period before WWI, when German saboteurs in the U.S. attempted to use bombs and even biological weapons, hoping to weaken the country enough to keep it from entering the war on the side of the Allies. The hero of the piece is New York Police Inspector Tom Tunney, who thwarted many of the plots and captured numerous enemy agents in New York. One problem common to books of this kind is that the author tries to make everything relate to the plot, sometimes pulling the rug out from under the reader in the process. For example, the opening describes a bomb plot aimed at St. Patrick&#x2019;s Cathedral in New York City, prompting the reader to think, &#x201C;Wow! I didn&#x2019;t know the Germans did that.&#x201D; We learn later that Blum is only setting the scene of an unstable era, and that the plot was actually the work of anarchists, not Germans.

Grade 4&ndash;7&mdash;It is 1968, and three black sisters from Brooklyn have been put on a California-bound plane by their father to spend a month with their mother, a poet who ran off years before and is living in Oakland. It's the summer after Black Panther founder Huey Newton was jailed and member Bobby Hutton was gunned down trying to surrender to the Oakland police, and there are men in berets shouting \"Black Power\" on the news. Delphine, 11, remembers her mother, but after years of separation she's more apt to believe what her grandmother has said about her, that Cecile is a selfish, crazy woman who sleeps on the street. At least Cecile lives in a real house, but she reacts to her daughters' arrival without warmth or even curiosity. Instead, she sends the girls to eat breakfast at a center run by the Black Panther Party and tells them to stay out as long as they can so that she can work on her poetry. Over the course of the next four weeks, Delphine and her younger sisters, Vonetta and Fern, spend a lot of time learning about revolution and staying out of their mother's way. Emotionally challenging and beautifully written, this book immerses readers in a time and place and raises difficult questions of cultural and ethnic identity and personal responsibility.

The plot maintains a breakneck pace&#x2014;we move from the Deckers at dinner getting a call from a distressed teen to the teen&#x2019;s revelation that his parents are missing from their hotel to the further revelation that Decker worked on a homicide case 15 years ago in which the now-absent father falsely confessed to murdering his high-school sweetheart, went to jail, and emerged as a hired killer. There goes dinner. Decker and Lazarus have to track down all these moving pieces. Meanwhile, a neonatal nurse with a wild private life is found brutally murdered. Naturally, we have to confront the fact that there may be a serial killer at work. Fans of Joseph Wambaugh will find a very different LAPD here&#x2014;less credible and certainly far less funny&#x2014;than the one he presents. Still, the family-drama side of this series is its main appeal to fans, and that&#x2019;s what will get them through a less-than-stellar effort. --Connie Fletcher",

David Benedictus has retained all the best elements of the original text to create a lively romp through the Hundred Acre Woods with Oscar-nominee Judi Dench narrating the way. She is joined by an excellent cast of British actors including Stephen Fry, Jane Horrocks, and Michael Williams. Using a variety of regional accents and vocal qualities, they bring Pooh, Christopher Robin, and all their friends to life. John Gould's music provides a perfect backdrop to Pooh's poetic creations and works as a natural chapter break. Good sound effects allow listeners to imagine themselves treading forest paths with the likes of Piglet and Eeyore. The cassettes are well marked, and the cover art features nicely colored versions of Ernest H. Shephard's original illustrations. The only drawback to the packaging is the clear plastic container which is likely to need replacing. This recording will be useful for introducing primary grade listeners to Pooh, but will also appeal to older children and adults.Barbara S. Wysocki, Cora J.

        "009950569X": "Starred Review.Unabashedly inspired by Malcolm Gladwell's bestsellingThe Tipping Point,the brothers Heath&mdash;Chip a professor at Stanford's business school, Dan a teacher and textbook publisher&mdash;offer an entertaining, practical guide to effective communication. Drawing extensively on psychosocial studies on memory, emotion and motivation, their study is couched in terms of \"stickiness\"&mdash;that is, the art of making ideas unforgettable. They start by relating the gruesome urban legend about a man who succumbs to a barroom flirtation only to wake up in a tub of ice, victim of an organ-harvesting ring. What makes such stories memorable and ensures their spread around the globe? The authors credit six key principles: simplicity, unexpectedness, concreteness, credibility, emotions and stories. (The initial letters spell out \"success\"&mdash;well, almost.) They illustrate these principles with a host of stories, some familiar (Kennedy's stirring call to \"land a man on the moon and return him safely to the earth\" within a decade) and others very funny (Nora Ephron's anecdote of how her high school journalism teacher used a simple, embarrassing trick to teach her how not to \"bury the lead\"). Throughout the book, sidebars show how bland messages can be made intriguing.

After all, when Ellen Grier and  her family return to the rural hamlet of Holly's Field, Wisconsin, it's not exactly a happy homecoming. Her husband, James, has been laid off from  his job in Illinois. And for the moment, the family has moved in with  Ellen's in-laws, Fritz and Mary-Margaret, an unhappy pair who dislike their daughter-in-law almost as much as they despise each other:The first time Ellen sat at this table she was twenty years old, bright-cheeked after a spring afternoon spent walking along the  lakefront with James, planning their upcoming wedding. It was 1959 and she was  eager to make a good impression. She didn't know then that Mary-Margaret  disliked her, that she was consideredJimmy's mistake.Thirteen years later, in 1972, Ellen is back at the table with no  escape in sight. Both she and her husband do find work. Yet James seems to  settle a tad too easily into his old life, and shows no interest in finding a place of their own. Even worse, his job takes him away from home for  weeks at a time, leaving Ellen to cope with her abusive in-laws.InVinegar HillAnsay paints a searing portrait of the Midwest's dark side, of a rural culture infected with despair and ruled over by  an unforgiving God. Yet she does hold out a grain of hope, too. Just as  Ellen seems permanently entangled in familial desperation, she makes a  surprising discovery about James's long-dead grandmother--a woman whose rebellious spirit inspires Ellen to rescue herself and her loved ones from the impinging darkness. This late-breaking redemption doesn't cancel out  the preceding unhappiness:Vinegar Hillremains a tough,  uncompromising tale, one that requires some fortitude to read. But those with the  heart for it will be rewarded with fine, spare prose and a hopeful ending.--Alix Wilber--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",
        "0061233781": "Amazon Best Books of the Month, October 2010: It's April 1865 and General Lee's troops have officially surrendered. Abraham Lincoln, looking forward to rebuilding the nation, celebrates with an evening&mdash;his last alive&mdash;at the theater. On the other side of the Mason-Dixon Line Jefferson Davis plans to move the Confederate government to North Carolina, away from Union troops that have captured Richmond. Under much different circumstances, both men embark on a dramatic final journey depicted by James. L. Swanson inBloody Crimes, a gripping account of the weeks following Lincoln&rsquo;s death and the end of the Civil War. While arguments erupted about where and how Lincoln&rsquo;s burial should take place, Jefferson Davis&mdash;refusing to let the South succumb&mdash;attempted to rally his people despite being hunted by Northern troops who suspected his involvement in Lincoln&rsquo;s assassination. Using relics and key documents of the day, Swanson juxtaposes the travels of Davis and Lincoln, weaving a fast-paced narrative that lures readers in from the get-go. We know that eventually Lincoln makes it to his final resting place and Davis is captured, but along the way it&rsquo;s hard not to wonder if these two heroic leaders were more similar than perhaps anyone would have guessed. Whether read as a companion toManhunt&mdash;Swanson&rsquo;s account of the 12-day search for John Wilkes Booth&mdash;or on its own,Bloody Crimesis the next great Civil War-era read worthy of the recognition that Lincoln once said we should all strive for.  --Jessica ScheinAmazon Exclusive: James L. Swanson on WritingBloody CrimesI wroteBloody Crimesas a way of answering a question manyManhuntreaders asked:  &ldquo;What happened next?&rdquo;  InManhuntI told just one of the three incredible stories that unfolded at the climax of the Civil War.  I could only hint at the strange and amazing things that happened to Lincoln&rsquo;s body after he died, and I could do no more than allude to Jefferson Davis&rsquo;s dramatic flight from Richmond and his six week odyssey to save the Confederacy. So it would be correct to say thatBloody Crimesis a sequel toManhunt.Since I was a child, I&rsquo;ve been fascinated by the Lincoln funeral train, and I debated whether to write a book about that story alone.  It is hard for a modern reader to comprehend how much Lincoln&rsquo;s death, the White House funeral, the Pennsylvania Avenue procession, and the president&rsquo;s sojourn home to Illinois influenced America.  Imagine the death of President Kennedy and intensify by several degrees the emotions it released.  As I researched the Lincoln funeral pageant, I began thinking about another president on his great journey.  As I studied Davis, I realized that he is one of the &ldquo;Lost Men&rdquo; of American history.  Today we know so little about him.  To my great surprise, he and Lincoln had much in common.  Some of their shared experiences were stunning, even profound.  And in April 1865, both presidents left their White Houses, took to the field, and sought to rally their armies at the climax of the war.Combining the final journeys of Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis into one book presented several challenges.  I needed to return to the assassination, but I did not want to repeat material fromManhunt. I solved that problem by, like a film director, shifting the camera and pointing it in a different direction.  InManhunt, my camera captured every moment of action inside Ford&rsquo;s Theatre. InBloody Crimes, that camera never sets foot inside Ford&rsquo;s, but instead takes position inside the Petersen House, capturing the assassination through fresh eyes, those of the boarders who lived there and the visitors who descended upon it.  InManhunt, once Lincoln was dead, he ceased to be a principal character in the book.  InBloody Crimes, though Lincoln is dead, he remains a vital character until the end.  One of the pleasures of writing the book was meeting the splendid cast of characters who played significant roles in the death pageant, including the larger-than-life Commissioner of Public Buildings in Washington, D.C., Benjamin Brown French, who kept an amazing diary.Another great pleasure was experiencing the final journey of Jefferson Davis through the firsthand accounts of his inner circle, cabinet members, young female loyalists, and his family, especially Davis&rsquo;s wife Varina.  The love letters they exchanged during his darkest days go unread today, but they are as moving as the correspondence of John and Abigail Adams.I cannot write a book without holding in my hand the original sources&mdash;Civil War newspapers, documents, photos, and artifacts&mdash;and I must visit the sites where history happened.  Through these objects and places, I travel back in time and, I hope, take my readers with me.  Many of the places I visited while writingBloody Crimesstill haunt me: The Confederate White House, where toys still lie upon the floor, as if the Davis children will return momentarily to continue their play;  the East Room of Lincoln&rsquo;s White House, site of his majestic funeral;  the cemetery vault in Georgetown, where Abraham Lincoln&rsquo;s dead son Willie waited for his father to claim him and bring him home to Illinois;  and the graves of Jefferson Davis and his family at Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond.  Indeed, shortly before the publication ofBloody Crimes, I visited the grave of Jefferson Davis.  A powerful storm had twisted and torn from the ground a mighty oak tree that had, for the past century, offered shade to Davis&rsquo;s grave and bronze statue.  Had the massive tree fallen in a slightly different direction, it would have smashed the gravestone and toppled Jefferson Davis from his pedestal.The final journeys of Lincoln and Davis, each a martyr to his cause, tell the stories of two men, two peoples, and two nations during the most thrilling days in American history.  Their dual stories form an American epic, a kind of AmericanIliad, that made our history, and that continues to influence it to this day.",

This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality.

        "0060883529": "Product DescriptionJane Leavy, the acclaimed author of theNew York TimesbestsellerSandy Koufax: A Lefty's Legacy, returns with a biography of an American original&mdash;number 7, Mickey Mantle. Drawing on more than 500 interviews with friends and family, teammates, and opponents, she delivers the definitive account of Mantle's life, mining the mythology of The Mick for the true story of a luminous and illustrious talent with an achingly damaged soul.Meticulously reported and elegantly written,The Last Boyis a baseball tapestry that weaves together episodes from the author's weekend with The Mick in Atlantic City, where she interviewed her hero in 1983, after he was banned from baseball, with reminiscences from friends and family of the boy from Commerce, Oklahoma, who would lead the Yankees to seven world championships, be voted the American League's Most Valuable Player three times, win the Triple Crown in 1956, and duel teammate Roger Maris for Babe Ruth's home run crown in the summer of 1961&mdash;the same boy who would never grow up.As she did so memorably in her biography of Sandy Koufax, Jane Leavy transcends the hyperbole of hero worship to reveal the man behind the coast-to-coast smile, who grappled with a wrenching childhood, crippling injuries, and a genetic predisposition to alcoholism. InThe Last Boyshe chronicles her search to find out more about the person he was and, given what she discovers, to explain his mystifying hold on a generation of baseball fans, who were seduced by that lopsided, gap-toothed grin. It is an uncommon biography, with literary overtones: not only a portrait of an icon, but an investigation of memory itself. How long was the Tape Measure Home Run? Did Mantle swing the same way right-handed and left-handed? What really happened to his knee in the 1951 World Series? What happened to the red-haired, freckle-faced boy known back home as Mickey Charles?\"I believe in memory, not memorabilia,\" Leavy writes in her preface. But inThe Last Boy, she discovers that what we remember of our heroes&mdash;and even what they remember of themselves&mdash;is only where the story begins.Amazon Q&amp;A: Bill Madden Interviews Jane LeavyFor more than 30 yearsBill Maddenhas covered the Yankees and Major League Baseball for theNew York Daily News. The author of several books about the Yankees, includingSteinbrenner: The Last Lion of Baseball, Madden is also the 2010 recipient of the Baseball Hall of Fame's J.G. Taylor Spink Award.Madden:Your best-selling biography of Sandy Koufax was a tour de force, partly because Koufax was a very private man whose life story had never really been told before. Mickey Mantle&rsquo;s life is quite the opposite, it&rsquo;s been in the subject of a spate of different &ldquo;autobiographies,&rdquo; some of which he even wrote. Under those circumstances, what made you want to take up another book about him?Leavy:Originally, I wanted to write about Willie, Mickey and The Duke in New York in the Fifties. The publisher said, &ldquo;Do The Mick. Everybody loves The Mick.&rdquo; I was wary because so much had been written about him&mdash;he left a paper trail as long as the drive from Commerce, Oklahoma to the Bronx, so I didn&rsquo;t expect to learn that he&rsquo;d been raised by a den of Alaskan she-wolves. My challenge was to strip away all the layers of myth that had accumulated and let Mickey breathe. And he, of all people, was my worst source. For example: the knee surgery he said he had after tripping over a drain in the 1951 World Series trying not to run into Joe DiMaggio in centerfield. In fact, he didn&rsquo;t have surgery until two years later. I only learned that because I went through every day of theNew York Timesfrom October 1951 to November 1953 looking for the date the knife fell! That&rsquo;s why this book took five years and nearly 600 interviews. I wanted to try to understand why after all these years, and all these revelations, Mickey Mantle still means so much to so many people&mdash;including me&mdash;and the first step was to get the basic facts straight.Madden:You make the point early on in the book that Mickey was a childhood hero, but you also have a recurring sequence in the book of your first interview with him in Atlantic City in 1983, where&mdash;at one point&mdash;he drunkenly makes a pass at you. What lingering effect did this have on how you ultimately approached your book?Leavy:I was plenty nervous when I met him. Mickey was my hero. But, he was also a very particular kind of role model. I was born two months prematurely (in a hospital a mile from Yankee Stadium) and came with some of the flaws that afflict those who don&rsquo;t incubate as long as we&rsquo;re supposed to. Mickey taught me how to function with pain and without complaint&mdash;his triumphs were mine. I was devastated with how he acted. After I&rsquo;d taken his hand from my knee, I called the only person I could think of still awake at that hour, a new mother, who basically told me to grow up.The next morning, over breakfast, I vented my anger and disappointment, railing at him for, among other things, greeting my youthful autograph request with flatulence. He was stunned and remorseful, albeit in a hilariously idiosyncratic manner. He gave me an 8 x 10 glossy that said, &ldquo;Sorry, I farted, your friend, Mick.&rdquo; For a moment, I felt I saw behind his crude fa&ccedil;ade. I decided the only way I could write this book was to acknowledge my lack of dispassion and scrutinize him completely. That&rsquo;s what happened that weekend in Atlantic City. It forced me to see the world as it was, not how I wanted it to be.Madden:One of the people I wish I'd been able to interview for my Steinbrenner book was Mantle, if only because I detected a very strained relationship between the two of them. Steinbrenner made a point to deify DiMaggio and had memorial services for Joe, Billy Martin, Roger Maris and Mel Allen, but did nothing for Mickey when he died. In your conversations with Mickey did he ever talk about Steinbrenner and anything that might have led to ill feelings toward each other?Leavy:When I told Mantle I&rsquo;d heard the Boss was thinking of turning Monument Park in centerfield into a water park for the disadvantaged youth of the South Bronx, Mantle was completely incredulous. He told me, &ldquo;It was 480 in centerfield when I played. It&rsquo;s 420 now and he&rsquo;s talking about bringing them in farther,&rdquo; and shook his head. &ldquo;I was at a banquet one time and I said to him, &lsquo;they ought to let those boys throw the ball up and hit it.&rsquo; That pissed him off.&rdquo;Mantle was interested in Yankee history&mdash;he grilled a friend who saw Babe Ruth lying in state in the rotunda at the Stadium about what it was like to be there that day. But I don&rsquo;t think he had a whole lot of patience with &ldquo;Yankeeography.&rdquo; It was a quick disillusionment. When he signed with the Yankees, reporters asked which Yankee had been his childhood hero. He said, &ldquo;Stan Musial.&rdquo; George Weiss, the general manager, immediately &ldquo;corrected&rdquo; his memory and from then on Joe D. was his hero. Furthermore, I think he was deeply disappointed with the baseball community&rsquo;s response&mdash;or lack of response&mdash;when commissioner Bowie Kuhn banned him in 1983 because of his affiliation with the Claridge Hotel and Casino, a job he had taken to pay for his son Billy&rsquo;s treatment for non-Hodgkin&rsquo;s Lymphoma. He told me, &ldquo;I feel really kind of bad no one took up for me.&rdquo; By &ldquo;no one&rdquo; I was pretty sure he meant Steinbrenner. The Yankees did little more than observe a moment of silence when Mantle died.Madden:It would seem that most everybody pertinent to the book cooperated with you, especially the Mantle family. I was grateful for the cooperation I had from George Steinbrenner&rsquo;s friends and associates when I wroteSteinbrenner, but I had an advantage that you didn&rsquo;t in that most of them knew me personally and, I suppose, trusted me. As a stranger, did you meet any significant resistance?Leavy:Danny and David Mantle&mdash;Mickey&rsquo;s sons&mdash;and their late mother, Merlyn&mdash;were extremely generous with their recollections and insights. Their openness about their lives and their relationship with their father was extraordinary. Like him, they are extremely honest. There&rsquo;s no put on, as folks in Commerce, Oklahoma like to say. I hope they&rsquo;ll come away from the book with a deeper understanding of the forces that formed him and contributed to his downfall, but I don&rsquo;t know how they&rsquo;ll react.Madden:This is the definitive &ldquo;warts and all&rdquo; biography of Mickey, with heavy emphasis on all of his demons. How do you think Mickey himself would feel about the book?Leavy:I think it&rsquo;s an honest book and Mantle was a very honest man. I don&rsquo;t see this is as a dark book. I hope it&rsquo;s enlightening in the most literal sense of the word and I hope that critics&mdash;and readers at large&mdash;will agree. I think the tragedy of Mantle is that he had so little time, at the beginning of his baseball career, and at the beginning of his sober life, to be his best self. He was a decent man who was genetically pre-disposed to alcoholism and enabled his whole life by the trappings of his celebrity. That&rsquo;s his story. As Billy Crystal told me about his movie,61*, Mickey wouldn&rsquo;t have wanted the sugar coat.His late wife, Merlyn, wrote about the sexual abuse he suffered as a young boy in the family memoir, &ldquo;A Hero All His Life&rdquo; and she elaborated on it when we spoke, as did several of his close friends. It turned out that his half sister wasn&rsquo;t his only abuser and experts tell me that many of the destructive behaviors he manifested are seen in victims of childhood sexual abuse. So, I came away with enormous compassion for him and, I hope, with an answer to the question posed by one of his minor league teammates: &ldquo;Mickey, what happened?&rdquo;",

Harry has recently won the National Book Award, and Madeleine, who comes from money, does everything, from playing tennis to cooking dinner, with sophisticated ease. Then, during one of their weekends at their Hamptons house, they meet beautiful 26-year-old Claire, an unabashed admirer of their lifestyle, who soon comes to be a fixture at their summer parties. When the Winslows decamp to Rome, where Harry struggles to complete his new novel, Claire is bereft. Then Harry returns to the States for a meeting with his publisher, and his chance encounter with Claire leads them to embark upon a passionate affair. All of the drama unleashed by their betrayal of Maddy is conveyed by Walter, a childhood friend of Maddy&#x2019;s who has long been in love with her. In his first novel, Dubow proves himself to be an elegant writer with a shrewd sense of how to shape his material for the broadest appeal. Glamorous settings, old money, and steamy sex all combine to make this one a totally addictive read. --Joanne Wilkinson",

Her sticky little brother Wentworth has been spirited away by the evil Queen of faerie, and it&#x92;s up to her to get him back safely. Having already decided to grow up to be a witch, now all Tiffany has to do is find her power. But she quickly learns that it&#x92;s not all black cats and broomsticks. According to her witchy mentor Miss Tick, \"Witches don&#x92;t use magic unless they really have to...We do other things. A witch pays attention to everything that&#x92;s going on...A witch uses her head...A witch always has a piece of string!\" Luckily, besides her trusty string, Tiffany&#x92;s also got the Nac Mac Feegles, or the Wee Free Men on her side. Small, blue, and heavily tattooed, the Feegles love nothing more than a good fight except maybe a drop of strong drink! Tiffany, heavily armed with an iron skillet, the feisty Feegles, and a talking toad on loan from Miss Tick, is a formidable adversary. But the Queen has a few tricks of her own, most of them deadly. Tiffany and the Feegles might get more than they bargained for on the flip side of Faerie! Prolific fantasy author Terry Pratchett has served up another delicious helping of his famed Discworld fare. The not-quite-teen set will delight in the Feegles&#x92; spicy, irreverent dialogue and Tiffany&#x92;s salty determination. Novices to Pratchett&#x92;s prose will find much to like here, and quickly go back to devour the rest of his Discworld offerings. Scrumptiously recommended.

        "B0001VGFK2": "It may not be a splashy leap forward, but Rockstar Games'Grand Theft Auto: San Andreasin its own deep, dark way does just as much to move and revolutionize video games as its two predecessors,Grand Theft Auto IIIandGrand Theft Auto: Vice City. As in previous installments, here you play as a thug with problems you must steal and shoot your way out of, but the problems this time are disconcertingly more realistic. You play as Carl Johnson, known on the street as CJ, a likeable criminal type who has just returned to his hometown, Los Santos (a fictionalized Los Angeles), to find that his mother has been murdered and that the police have framed him for another murder. Reunions with his friends and a troubled relationship with his brother set off a sprawling, complex plot line, taking place at first in the immediate Los Santos area but eventually spilling into San Fierro (based on San Francisco) and Las Venturas (Las Vegas).You play as Carl Johnson, known on the street as CJ.This is an honest effort to create an engaging story about sympathetic characters caught up in a brutal environment that is on par with a movie or novel.Gaming GangstersWhereVice Citytook its cues, with tongue firmly in cheek, from the 1980s television seriesMiami Vice,San Andreasis a sincere homage to early 1990s innercity gangster films likeMenace 2 SocietyandBoyz &#x91;N the Hood. This is an honest effort to create an engaging story about sympathetic characters caught up in a brutal environment that is on par with a movie or novel. If that effort hits a few flat notes (you would have to be totally desensitized not to wonder if it's OK to make entertainment out of driveby shootings), it may also mark the first step toward video games growing up.  The first thing that fans of earlierGTAgames will notice is the range of action is much wider now: Along with shooting, running, and driving, there's now swimming, eating, working out, shopping, and, yes, getting a haircut. All this means the game has a fairly steep learning curve. But, though the pick-up-and-play appeal ofGrand Theft Auto IIImay be long gone, your access to the action becomes fairly transparent after a little practice. My only serious complaint is that, with the controller now crowded with such previously unheard-of functions like \"Gang Active\" and \"Talk Positive,\" you can drive only with the left analog stick. A minor point, but it makes cars a lot more difficult to handle.Bicycles take on a surprisingly central role.Vehicular VarietyIt would be hard to surpass the variety of automobiles available in earlier games, andSan Andreaswisely does not for the most part try to compete on that score. Instead, it's bicycles of all things that steal the show. The bikes' speed and flexibility are perfect for many of the missions, and there is something about cruising through the streets and basketball courts on a BMX that just feels right. If you play far enough into the game, you will also be rewarded with the chance to fly a number of aircraft, and flying is something Rockstar makes a greater effort to get right this time (welcome news for anyone who struggled with the planes and &#x91;copters of the earlier games).Lackluster Graphics--but a Real FeelGraphics--never a huge priority for Rockstar--actually take a step backward from the luscious, tropical look ofVice City. Textures are rendered with only a cursory attention to detail, and contours are often blocky. It scarcely matters, though, because no matter howSan Andreaslooks, itfeelsreal. This is due in no small part to voice work by an all-star cast including Samuel L. Jackson, Ice T, James Woods, Peter Fonda, and Outkast's Big Boy and a stellar soundtrack with tunes by Soundgarden, 2Pac, Public Enemy, and even a few country classics from the likes of Willie Nelson. But it's not just realistic,San Andreasis also vast, encompassing three big urban centers and huge swaths of rural land (complete with shotgun-toting farmers) between them. This vastness does mean, however, that there can be a lot of tedious driving to get to the missions, which, along with some awkward sequencing of the cut scenes (they are in places stacked one on top of the other), means that there is a bit too much downtime.  But never mind the quibbles. Ladies and gentlemen, we have another classic on our hands.--David StoeszPros:Astonishingly vast game spaceVivid character developmentComplex, engaging plotEnormous range of available actionsCons:Occasionally awkward game designYou can no longer steer cars with the directional buttonsSteep learning curveWhat's Your Strategy?Get mission strategies and detailed maps to achieve every objective with theGrand Theft Auto: San Andreas Official Strategy Guide.",

From that uncomfortable realization came his popular Physique Transformation Contest (top prize that first year: Phillips's own Lamborghini), now world famous, and this book.The three-times-a-week weightlifting program inBody for Lifeis deceptively simple. If you've spent any time in the gym, you've already done all the exercises. But Phillips includes a couple of high-intensity sets at the end of each exercise that should compound the training effect on each muscle group. Same goes for the cardiovascular exercise he recommends: just 20 minutes, three times a week. But those 20 minutes are spent jacking the intensity up and down, accomplishing more in less time.Phillips arranges all this into a 12-week program, along with nutritional and motivational tips. Be warned that the nutritional advice gets a little spacey. For example, he puts \"carbohydrates\" and \"vegetables\" into separate categories, and recommends three daily doses of a nutritional supplement called Myoplex, which his company manufactures. (Fortunately, he gives tips on how to make each dose taste different, such as by adding drops of peppermint extract.)

With his ex-wife,  pediatrician Sara Linton, Jeffrey uncovers a child sex and pornography ring  involving Jenny, her classmates, and their mothers--a horrific enterprise that  culminated in the killing that Tolliver will never be able to forget. This taut,  chilling thriller showcases Karin Slaughter's skill at plotting, pace, and  narrative, and will linger in the reader's mind long after the stunning  denouement.

        "B00001XDUB": "A downright creepy \"survival horror\" title,Silent Hillsucceeds where mostResident Evil-inspired titles suck: keeping  you hooked and instilling you with fear throughout the game. Players  are cast as Harry Mason in his desperate search for his daughter, who  mysteriously disappeared after their car crashed into a gully outside  of a desolate resort town.The 3-D environments inSilent Hillare bathed in fog or  darkness, making its dismal setting all the more eerie; this also  allows for some spectacular lighting effects when using a flashlight in  the dark. Granted, there are some pretty coarse graphics being obscured  here, but it's a fair trade-off, considering the game's short load  times.Silent Hillis played from a third-person perspective, viewed  from both fixed and moving camera angles. As with similar games, the  viewpoint can be awkward at times, especially during combat, which here  is so clunky that you should try to avoid it whenever possible--something  you should do anyway, as this isn'tTomb Raider.Rather than resort to cheap scare tactics,Silent Hillfeatures  a gameplay twist that works very well with its limited visibility  environments. Harry carries a radio with him that crackles with static  whenever the game's nasties are near, and continues until they're no  longer in the vicinity or have been killed off. (Enemies may require  further whacking when they're down, as they like to play dead.)

Pepperberg, who teaches animal cognition, has previously documented the results of her 30-year relationship with Alex inThe Alex Studies. While this book inevitably covers some of the same ground, it is a moving tribute that beautifully evokes the struggles, the initial triumphs, the setbacks, the unexpected and often stunning achievements during a groundbreaking scientific endeavor spent uncovering cognitive abilities in Alex that no one believed were possible, and challenging science's deepest assumptions about the origin of human cognitive abilities. Pepperberg deftly interweaves her own personal narrative&mdash;including her struggles to gain recognition for her research&mdash;with more intimate scenes of life with Alex than she was able to present in her earlier work, creating a story that scientists and laypeople can equally enjoy, if they can all keep from crying over Alex's untimely death.(Nov.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0060652969": "The Problem of Painanswers the universal question, \"Why would an  all-loving, all-knowing God allow people to experience pain and suffering?\"  Master Christian apologist C.S. Lewis asserts that pain is a problem because our  finite, human minds selfishly believe that pain-free lives would prove that God  loves us. In truth, by asking for this, we want God to love us less, not more  than he does. \"Love, in its own nature, demands the perfecting of the beloved;  that the mere 'kindness' which tolerates anything except suffering in its object  is, in that respect at the opposite pole from Love.\" In addressing \"Divine  Omnipotence,\" \"Human Wickedness,\" \"Human Pain,\" and \"Heaven,\" Lewis succeeds in  lifting the reader from his frame of reference by artfully capitulating these  topics into a conversational tone, which makes his assertions easy to swallow  and even easier to digest. Lewis is straightforward in aim as well as honest  about his impediments, saying, \"I am not arguing that pain is not painful. Pain  hurts. I am only trying to show that the old Christian doctrine that being made  perfect through suffering is not incredible. To prove it palatable is beyond my  design.\" The mind is expanded, God is magnified, and the reader is reminded that  he is not the center of the universe as Lewis carefully rolls through the  dissertation that suffering is God's will in preparing the believer for heaven  and for the full weight of glory that awaits him there. While many of us naively  wish that God had designed a \"less glorious and less arduous destiny\" for his  children, the fortune lies in Lewis's inclination to set us straight with his  charming wit and pious mind.--Jill Heatherly",
        "0061671339": "Chesley-winning illustrator Brom (The Plucker) weaves together gloomy prose and horrifying adventures in this macabre fairy tale inspired by J.M. Barrie'sPeter Pan. Born of faerie blood, Peter hunts abandoned children, runaways and the hopeless, recruiting for his Devils in Avalon and promising them a place where you never have to grow up. He conveniently fails to mention that Avalon's monsters are very real, and the Devils must practice their war games or risk being tortured to death, eaten or worse. While early chapters are promising, this gothic fantasy stumbles on its own darkness. The devilishly amusing flashbacks to Peter's origins don't make up for the heavy-handed bloodshed, rampant violence and two-dimensional characters.

But now he's traveling to Oden's Ford to earn an education in the magical arts, and it will not be without peril. Despite the fact that the academy is known as &#x201C;the great leveler,&#x201D; there are students who have reason to hate Han, specifically the Bayar twins, Micah and Fiona, because he stole the Demon King's amulet from their father, the High Wizard. To gain the upper hand on them, Han joins forces with a mysterious wizard he met in the dream world, but what this wizard asks in return may be more than the teen wishes to give. Meanwhile, Princess Raisa has fled from an arranged marriage with Micah Bayar. She and her loyal&#x2013;and beloved&#x2013;soldier, Amon, are also making their way to Oden's Ford so that Raisa might receive a military education in order to become a stronger ruler. Raisa's and Han's paths have crossed in the past, but when they meet again their connection is more powerful than before. Chima has created an intricate world with a rich history, cultural prejudices, and complicated political dynamics.

        "0061130400": "Sofer's family escaped from Iran in 1982 when she was 10, an experience that may explain the intense detail of this unnerving debut. On a September day in 1981, gem trader Isaac Amin is accosted by Revolutionary Guards at his Tehran office and imprisoned for no other crime than being Jewish in a country where Muslim fanaticism is growing daily. Being rich and having had slender ties to the Shah's regime magnify his peril. In anguish over what might be happening to his family, Isaac watches the brutal mutilation and executions of prisoners around him. His wife, Farnaz, struggles to keep from slipping into despair, while his young daughter, Shirin, steals files from the home of a playmate whose father is in charge of the prison that holds her father. Far away in Brooklyn, Isaac's nonreligious son, Parviz, struggles without his family's money and falls for the pious daughter of his Hasidic landlord. Nicely layered, the story shimmers with past secrets and hidden motivations. The dialogue, while stiff, allows the various characters to come through. Sofer's dramatization of just-post-revolutionary Iran captures its small tensions and larger brutalities, which play vividly upon a family that cannot, even if it wishes to, conform.(Aug.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

No wonder 14-year-old Georgia Nicolson laments, \"Honestly, what is the point?\" A Bridget Jones for the younger set, Georgia records the momentous events of her life--and they are all momentous--in her diary, which serves as a truly hilarious account of what it means to be a modern girl on the cusp of womanhood. No matter that her particular story takes place in England, the account of her experiences rings true across the ocean (and besides, \"Georgia's Glossary\" swiftly eradicates any language barriers).The author, Louise Rennison, is a British comedy writer and it shows. Whether  Georgia is dealing with wearing a bra (\"OK, it's a bit on the loose side and does ride up round my neck if I run for the bus\"), pondering kissing and how to know which way to turn your head (\"You don't want to be bobbing around like pigeons for hours\"), or managing the results of an overzealous eyebrow-plucking episode (\"Obviously, now I have to stay in forever\"), she always cracks us up. Georgia struggles with the myriad issues facing teen girls--boys, of course being at the forefront--but she does it with such humor and honesty it almost seems like a good time.

Some days, Caren Gray can hardly believe she is still rooted to Belle Vie, the Louisiana plantation where she grew up, where her mother was a cook and her great-great-great-grandfather was a slave. Now the single mother to a nine-year-old daughter, she manages the showplace, which has long been owned by the prosperous Clancy family and is a popular site for weddings and banquets. Despite the beauty of the house and grounds, Caren still feels uneasy whenever she visits the former slave quarters, a stark reminder of the antebellum plantation&#x2019;s notorious past. When a cane worker is found with her throat slit, Caren is drawn into the investigation as the police target one of her employees as the murderer. Soon, though, Caren learns some rather unsavory information about the Clancy family and their nefarious dealings in both the past and the present.

Inventive, satirical of the contemporary scene, Pratchett does not merely play with words, he juggles shrewd observations with aplomb. His creations are gently allegorical: for instance, the Unseen University Library is the repository of magic, its librarian an orangutan and its archchancellorship reserved for the most powerful magician, a \"sourcerer\" named Coin.

They find themselves traveling back to Planet Veldin to battle Dr. Nefarious, a robotic supervillain who has devised a diabolical scheme to wipe out all organic life in the galaxy. To reach his goal, he has instructed the Tyhrranoids, a race of multi-eye aliens to annihilate the organics. However, while Dr. Nefarious is aware that if the Tyhrranoids are successful, they will end up causing their own extinction, the Tyhrranoids are not aware of this danger.To fight back, Ratchet and Clank are able to recruit Captain Qwark, a favorite from previous games, out of retirement to lead the Q-Force, an unlikely band of heroic space cadets comprised of some of the most memorable characters from the Ratchet & Clank franchise.

        "0060738170": "Starred Review.In the absence of any original manuscripts of the books of the New Testament, how can we be sure that we're getting the intended words and meaning? Ehrman, professor of religion at UNC&ndash;Chapel Hill, has devoted his life to the study of such questions and here offers an engaging and fascinating look at the way scholars try to answer them. Part memoir, part history and part critical study, he traces the development of the academic discipline called textual criticism, which uses external and internal evidence to evaluate and compare ancient manuscripts in order to find the best readings. Ehrman points out that scribes altered almost all of the manuscripts we now have. In the early days of the Christian movement, scribal error often arose simply from unintentional omissions of words or lines. As Christianity evolved into an official religion under Constantine, however, scribes often added material to existing manuscripts or altered them to provide scriptural support for Christian doctrine or to enforce specific views about women, Jews or pagans. Ehrman's absorbing story, fresh and lively prose and seasoned insights into the challenges of recreating the texts of the New Testament ensure that readers might never read the Gospels or Paul's letters the same way again.(Nov.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0062008110": "The main drama in Bronte's novel happens in a long narrative told by an elderly housekeeper to a convalescing new tenant. This story-within-a-story setup makes it well suited for audio adaptation, as Scales takes the housekeeper's part and relates the past, while West performs as the tenant and describes the present. Scales primarily uses a folksy lower-class accent, but she also makes her voice harsh and threatening when speaking as Heathcliff, the surly man at the novel's heart. West, as the bewildered tenant, manages to sound both nervous and pretentious, but his part is fairly small, especially with this abridgment, so he mostly serves to provide transitions for the housekeeper's story. The extensive abridgment generally deletes sentences and phrases rather than entire paragraphs or sections. One drawback for the audio format is the difficulty of clarifying the novel's convoluted plot and family tree, since it's harder to search back through long CD tracks than through earlier chapters of the paperback. While a little of the depth of Bronte's writing is lost in abridgment, the novel's emotional core remains intact and wrenching, and the actors' heartfelt interpretations make it easy to imagine being curled up by a warm fire listening to an absorbing tale.

Almost more strange than the man at the crossroads, a mysterious girl, Namine, draws pictures inside Castle Oblivion under close surveillance of an evil organization. As the story alludes, she may hold the key to Sora's most special memories.",

        "0060922532": "Taylor Greer and her adopted Cherokee daughter Turtle, first met in The Bean Trees , will captivate readers anew in Kingsolver's assured and eloquent sequel, which mixes wit, wisdom and the expert skills of a born raconteur into a powerfully affecting narrative. Now six years old and still bearing psychological marks of the abuse that occured before she was rescued by Taylor, Turtle is discovered by formidable Indian lawyer Annawake Fourkiller, who insists that the child be returned to the Cherokee Nation. Taylor reacts by fleeing her Tucson home with Turtle to begin a precarious existence on the road; skirting the edge of poverty and despair, she eventually realizes that Turtle has become emotionally unmoored. In taking a fresh look at the Solomonic dilemma of choosing between two equally valid claims on a child's life, Kingsolver achieves the admirable feat of making the reader understand and sympathize with both sides of the controversy, as she contrasts Taylor's inalterable mother's love with Annawake's determination to save Turtle from the stigmatization she can expect from white society. The chronicle acquires depth and humor when Kingsolver integrates the story of Taylor's mother Alice, a woman who believes that the Greers are \"doomed to be a family with no men in it\" (that she is proven wrong adds a delicious element of romance to the story). Alice's resolve to help her daughter takes her into the heart of the Cherokee Nation and results in an astonishing but credible meshing of lives. In the end, both justice and compassion are served. Kingsolver's intelligent consideration of issues of family and culture--both in her evocation of Native American society and in her depiction of the plight of a single mother--brims with insight and empathy. Every page of this beautifully controlled narrative offers prose shimmering with imagery and honed to simple lyric intensity. In short, the delights of superior fiction can be experienced here. 100,000 first printing; $125,000 ad/promo; BOMC alternate; author tour.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

Though Carpathians roam the streets at night and gain strength from feeding on blood, they only kill evildoers and vampires. Transformed into a night creature when she was a child, Destiny is unlike any of Feehan's previous heroines. Her physical strength is equal to that of her Carpathian counterpart, Nicolae Von Shrieder, but she's horrified by what she is and haunted by memories of her parents' brutal murder. Nicolae merged his mind with hers when she was first transformed, and through their mental connection, he taught her how to survive. Now Nicolae must find Destiny and make her his lifemate, or he will succumb to darkness and become a vampire. Feehan's protagonists and prose can be overwrought (\"His body was hard and full, aching for her.... and deep within, the crouching beast lifted its head and roared for release\"), and inconsistencies litter the text (Destiny can supposedly read Nicolae's mind, but it takes her eons to trust him and stop threatening to kill him).

        "0099526409": "First published in 1970, this extraordinary book changed the way Americans think about the original inhabitants of their country. Beginning with the Long Walk of the Navajos in 1860 and ending 30 years later with the massacre of Sioux men, women, and children at Wounded Knee in South Dakota, it tells how the American Indians lost their land and lives to a dynamically expanding white society. During these three decades, America's population doubled from 31 million to 62 million. Again and again, promises made to the Indians fell victim to the ruthlessness and greed of settlers pushing westward to make new lives. The Indians were herded off their ancestral lands into ever-shrinking reservations, and were starved and killed if they resisted. It is a truism that \"history is written by the victors\"; for the first time, this book described the opening of the West from the Indians' viewpoint. Accustomed to stereotypes of Indians as red savages, white Americans were shocked to read the reasoned eloquence of Indian leaders and learn of the bravery with which they and their peoples endured suffering. With meticulous research and in measured language overlaying brutal narrative,Dee Brownfocused attention on a national disgrace. Still controversial but with many of its premises now accepted,Bury My Heart at Wounded Kneehas sold 5 million copies around the world.

        "0060256656": "To say that this particular apple tree is a \"giving tree\" is an understatement. In Shel Silverstein's popular tale of few words and simple line drawings, a tree starts out as a leafy playground, shade provider, and apple bearer for a rambunctious little boy. Making the boy happy makes the tree happy, but with time it becomes more challenging for the generous tree to meet his needs. When he asks for money, she suggests that he sell her apples. When he asks for a house, she offers her branches for lumber. When the boy is old, too old and sad to play in the tree, he asks the tree for a boat. She suggests that he cut her down to a stump so he can craft a boat out of her trunk. He unthinkingly does it. At this point in the story, the double-page spread shows a pathetic solitary stump, poignantly cut down to the heart the boy once carved into the tree as a child that said \"M.E. + T.\" \"And then the tree was happy... but not really.\" When there's nothing left of her, the boy returns again as an old man, needing a quiet place to sit and rest. The stump offers up her services, and he sits on it. \"And the tree was happy.\" While the message of this book is unclear (Take and take and take?  Give and give and give? Complete self-sacrifice is good? Complete self-sacrifice is infinitely sad?), Silverstein has perhaps deliberately left the book open to interpretation. (All ages)--Karin Snelson",

But this is not the same hometown she grew up in.

Love and hate, beauty and ugliness, cruelty and charity--each idea is stripped of its ethical trappings, smashed up against its opposite number, and laid bare for our examination.Confessions of an Ugly Stepsisterbegins in 17th-century Holland, where the two Fisher  sisters and their mother have fled to escape a hostile England. Maguire's characters are at once more human and more fanciful than their fairy-tale originals.  Plain but smart Iris and her sister, Ruth, a hulking simpleton, are dazed and terrified as their mother, Margarethe, urges them into the strange Dutch streets. Within days, purposeful Margarethe has secured the family a place in  the home of an aspiring painter, where for a short time, they find happiness.But this isCinderella, after all, and tragedy is inevitable. When a wealthy tulip speculator commissions the painter to capture his blindingly lovely daughter, Clara, on canvas, Margarethe jumps at the chance to better their lot. \"Give me room to cast my eel spear, and let follow what may,\" she crows, and the Fisher family abandons the artist  for the upper-crust Van den Meers.When Van den Meer's wife dies during childbirth, the stage is set for Margarethe to take over the household and for Clara to adopt the role  of \"Cinderling\" in order to survive. What follows is a changeling adventure, and of course a ball, a handsome prince, a  lost slipper, and what might even be a fairy godmother. In a single magic night, the exquisite and the ugly swirl around in a heated mix:Everything about this moment hovers, trembles, all their sweet, unreasonable hopes on view before anything has had the chance to go wrong. A stepsister spins on black and white tiles, in glass  slippers and a gold gown, and two stepsisters watch with unrelieved admiration. The light pours in, strengthening in its golden hue as the sun sinks  and the evening approaches. Clara is as otherworldly as the Donkeywoman,  the Girl-Boy. Extreme beauty is an affliction...But beyond these familiar elements, Maguire's second novel becomes something else altogether--a morality play, a psychological study, a feminist manifesto, or perhaps a plain explanation of what it is to be human. Villains turn out to be heroes, and heroes disappoint. The story's narrator wryly observes, \"In the lives of children, pumpkins can turn into coaches, mice and rats into human beings. When we grow up, we  learn that it's far more common for human beings to turn into rats.\"--Therese Littleton",

Instead, the former ballerina finds herself overwhelmed by memories of her homeland and of the events, both glorious and heartbreaking, that changed the course of her life half a century ago.It was in Russia that she discovered the magic of the theater; that she fell in love with the poet Viktor Elsin; that she and her dearest companions&mdash;Gersh, a brilliant composer, and the exquisite Vera, Nina&rsquo;s closest friend&mdash;became victims of Stalinist aggression. And it was in Russia that a terrible discovery incited a deadly act of betrayal&mdash;and an ingenious escape that led Nina to the West and eventually to Boston.Nina has kept her secrets for half a lifetime. But two people will not let the past rest: Drew Brooks, an inquisitive young associate at a Boston auction house, and Grigori Solodin, a professor of Russian who believes that a unique set of jewels may hold the key to his own ambiguous past. Together these unlikely partners begin to unravel a mystery surrounding a love letter, a poem, and a necklace of unknown provenance, setting in motion a series of revelations that will have life-altering consequences for them all.A Q&amp;A with Author Daphne KalotayQ:Russian Winterincludes a cast of fascinating characters. Were any of these diverse characters modeled after anyone specific?Kalotay:The central protagonist, Nina Revskaya (a ballerina) and her mother-in-law (the former aristocrat) are both modeled on relatives of mine.Nina is in some ways based on my Hungarian grandmother.  Now 93 years old, she too has a very strong personality, and I see in her the same fiery strength Nina exhibits.  My grandmother is a more joyous and loving person than Nina, but once she decides she doesn&rsquo;t like someone, that&rsquo;s it; she is very headstrong, and I&rsquo;ve glimpsed the way that she decides that certain people are her enemies.  It&rsquo;s a quality that has long intrigued me.Q:Your family were Holocaust survivors and escaped from behind the Iron Curtain&mdash;Hungary&mdash;in 1956. How did that background influence the story?Kalotay:I suppose the most profound way my family&rsquo;s history influenced my novel is&mdash;ironically&mdash;that I tried to avoid that history and transfer it to another place and time, rather than address it directly.  Just as my father never speaks of his experience of the Holocaust, I&rsquo;ve chosen not to write in a direct way about that topic or about my father&rsquo;s childhood in post-war Hungary, though that experience has of course informed so much of my family&rsquo;s trajectory and personality.  I&rsquo;ve long heard recollections of my grandmother, aunt, and father&rsquo;s life in Soviet-occupied Hungary, and in the 1980&rsquo;s I saw for myself what life under communism was like there.  But, perhaps because that experience still isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;mine,&rdquo; I felt more comfortable transporting those realities to the harsher world of Soviet Russia.Q:You worked onRussian Winterfor six years.  What was the most difficult aspect of writing the novel?  What kind of research did you do?Kalotay:The most difficult part of writing this book was figuring out how to allow my imagination to run free when in fact the constraints of Stalinist society meant fewer possibilities for what characters might say or do, or where they might go, than in an open society.  I felt very restrained by the basic logistics of a world where everyone is fearful and being reported on and can&rsquo;t just go off and do whatever they like.In order to get a better sense of this, I did a lot of reading, mostly memoirs and biographies by artists and intellectuals who had experienced that era, or by Westerners who had travelled behind the Iron Curtain during that time (though of course their experience was quite different.) I also made a visit to Russia, but that was after I&rsquo;d finished writing.Q:Russian Winteris an evocative portrait of life in the Soviet Union under Stalin, a time and place where politics and art were inextricably intertwined.  How did Stalin use art to further his goals, and do you see any similarities here in the West of today?Kalotay:Stalin understood, on the most basic level, that a beautiful ballet can be uplifting even when the realities of life are very harsh, and that a well-choreographed parade with dance and acrobatics really can instill national pride and dispel doubts.In a way it&rsquo;s amazing to think that in America most artists and writers like myself never have to give a thought to whether or not their work is going get them in trouble.  Our censors are the hoops we have to jump through to get published or have a show produced or a painting shown.  Our gatekeepers aren&rsquo;t politicians; they&rsquo;re editors or producers, and the tyranny isn&rsquo;t politics but what&rsquo;s in vogue, or what&rsquo;s cheapest to produce, or what the marketing folks think will make money.  And yet it&rsquo;s a capitalist society that allows us the privilege to make any sort of art we want, whether or not anyone notices it or pays attention.Q:When you began the novel did you have the ending in mind, or did the story lead you?Kalotay:I knew what Nina&rsquo;s general trajectory would be, and that the professor&rsquo;s original assumptions would turn out to be somehow incorrect, because I&rsquo;d already written a short story that ended that way.  But I didn&rsquo;t know exactly how it would all come together, plot-wise, or what kind of rapprochement would be possible for my characters.  There were also a lot of logistics I had to figure out&mdash;such as how, specifically, my dancer would manage to get out of the Soviet Union.Q:What does artistic freedom mean to you?Kalotay:For me it means being able to write what I want.  Here our freedom is tied not so much to political realities as financial ones, and I think people like myself worry more that we won&rsquo;t necessarily be &ldquo;allowed&rdquo; to write what we want (in my case smaller, understated novels rather than flashy, sensational or trendy ones) without losing the support of the publishing world.(Photo by Jeremy Saladyga)",

As much a memoir as a primer on the vicissitudes of an actor&#8217;s life, the book is a collage based on real-life situations that offer touching insights into stars like Rita Hayworth, and into the practical magic that informs Langella&#8217;s signature sensibility.&#8221; (The New Yorker)&#8220;Rarely have I read a book about celebrities that is as insightful, candid, revealing, and as well-written as this one. Frank Langella&#8217;s memoir is not the usual author&#8217;s ego trip, but rather his remembrances of the many accomplished men and women that he has come to know.&#8221; (Gay Talese, author of A Writer's Life)&#8220;A delightfully unabashed page-turner about people we wish we had known in the throes of work, love, and growing old.&#8221; (A.R.

Mr. Langella is surgically precise, and eloquent. . . . The human condition in most of its vagaries is beautifully rendered between these pages.&#8221; (Liz Smith)&#8220; If Frank Langella&#8217;s memoir simply did what its title promises, it would be deep-dish gossip. But his memories of the stars he&#8217;s encountered during a lengthy career on Broadway and in film shed perceptive light on the costs of pursuing and maintaining fame.&#8221; (Detroit Free Press)&#8220;Langella&#8217;s uncommonly eloquent book is enjoyable for the panoply of great names who turn up. . . . A natural raconteur, he seems to fit precisely Henry James&#8217;s famous description of the novelist as one &#8216;on whom nothing is lost.&#8217;&#8221; (New York Times)&#8220;Frank Langella&#8217;s DROPPED NAMES is a different kind of memoir. . . . Not many of his peers could write such an eloquently dishy book.&#8221; (Los Angeles Times)&#8220;The 65 chapters in this satisfyingly scandalous memoir paint Broadway and Hollywood as teeming with vulgar, neurotic and irresistible company, and Langella as relentlessly affable in the face of nonstop groping by celebrities in far-flung locations.&#8221; (Paperback Row,New York Times)",
        "0062049607": "Months after Usha Pramal is murdered in London, Scotland Yard&#x2014;having declared the crime a cold case&#x2014;contracts with Maisie Dobbs for help. But the day before psychologist and investigator Maisie is to meet with Usha&#x2019;s friend and fellow countrywoman Maya Patel, Maya is killed in the same manner as Usha. Maisie wonders who would have wanted to kill Usha, by all accounts an exceptionally beautiful, caring, and well-educated woman who comforted others with her touch and remedies. As Maisie looks into the status of Indian women in England, her own desire to travel deepens, leading to further conundrums involving both her would-be fianc&#xE9;, James Compton, and her business. The cross-cultural theme adds another dimension to Winspear&#x2019;s London of 1933, with its lingering traces of World War I and ominous rumblings of World War II. This tenth Maisie Dobbs mystery continues the series&#x2019; high quality, capturing a time and place and featuring a protagonist as compassionate as she is intuitive. A fine historical mystery with broad appeal. --Michele Leber",

Pratchett's wackiness collaborates with Gaiman's morbid humor; the result is a humanist delight to be savored and reread again and again.  You see, there was a bit of a mixup when the Antichrist was born, due in part to the machinations of Crowley, who did not so much fall as saunter  downwards, and in part to the mysterious ways as manifested in the form of a part-time rare book dealer, an angel named Aziraphale.  Like top agents everywhere, they've long had more in common with each other than the sides they represent, or the conflict they are nominally engaged in.  The only person  who knows how it will all end is Agnes Nutter, a witch whose  prophecies all come true, if one can only manage to decipher them.

McKay writes in the voice of shipbuilder's daughter, Dora Rare, \"the only daughter in five generations of Rares,\" who as a girl befriends the elderly and estranged Marie Babineau, long the local midwife (ortraiteur), who claims to have marked Dora out from birth as her successor. After initial reluctance and increasingly intensive training, 17-year-old Dora moves in with Marie; on the eve of Dora's marriage to Archer Bigelow, Marie disappears, leaving Dora her practice. A difficult marriage, many difficult births, a patient's baby thrust on her to raise without warning and other crises (including WWI and the introduction of \"clinical\" birthing methods) ensue. Period advertisments, journal entries and letters to and from various characters give Dora's voice context.

        "0061144835": "Outnumbered Saxon forces continue battling Danish invaders in this rousing sequel to the bestsellingThe Last Kingdom. It's A.D. 877, and the dispossessed Northumbrian noble Uhtred has just routed the Danes in a battle at Cynuit in southern England. Logically, Uhtred should now ally himself with Alfred, whose Wessex kingdom alone has successfully resisted Danish control. But Uhtred sees a better chance of recovering his lost estate if he finds a way to join the Danes, who raised him and whose simple life of \"ale, women, sword, and reputation\" he finds more congenial than Alfred's Christian piety and military caution. But when the Danes invade Wessex, Uhtred's loyalties are further divided. His Celtic mistress foretells victory for Alfred, but Uhtred can scarcely believe that the bedraggled king, camped in isolated marshes with a handful of supporters, can repel the invaders and unite England. Yet pride grows in Uhtred: \"I understood that among the Danes I was as important as my friends, and without friends I was just another landless, masterless warrior. But among the Saxons I was another Saxon, and among the Saxons I did not need another man's generosity.\" Uhtred demonstrates his newfound patriotism in the book's climactic battle at Edington. Filled with bawdy humor, bloodlust, treachery and valor, this stirring tale will leave readers eager for the next volume in this Alfred the Great series.(Jan.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The ancient world would eventually both praise and damn the infamous ?Ghost of Sparta? as the mortal who slayed a god, but long before his battle with Ares, Kratos sought absolution from his past sins by pledging himself as a champion to the gods. These brutal crusades in the name of Olympus became legendary, but would have far-reaching consequences. InChains of OlympusKratos is pushed to the edge as he is ordered by the gods to journey to the very depths of the underworld after the world plunges into darkness. There he must face the most feared creatures of Greek mythology and is forced to choose between his own personal redemption and saving the ancient world from certain destruction. It is a choice that will shake the immortals from their perches on Mt.

        "B0000DJX7I": "Praised for brilliant scripts and open-ended gameplay, vilified for unapologetic violence and mature themes,Grand Theft Autohas deservedly become one of the most popular game franchises in history. This double pack contains the full versions of bothGrand Theft Auto IIIandGrand Theft Auto III: Vice City, enhanced for Xbox. Xbox gamers can rejoice that the grand king of video games--The Sopranoswith a gamepad--is finally available on the big black box.Grand Theft AutoWithGrand Theft Auto IIIRockstar proves that not all developers are concerned with toning down the violence in their games. This sequel is even more bloody, violent, and sadistic than its popular predecessors, offering up an enormous 3-D city in which nearly any criminal act is possible. Players are free to steal cars, beat up the local population for their money (or weapons), make time with prostitutes, or simply roam to their heart's content. Those seeking more structure can embark on dozens of missions driven by a genuinely interesting crime-story plot or steal cars that let them play minigames. Nab a cop car and you can go on vigilante missions. Grab a cab and you can play a deadly version ofCrazy Taxi. Take a fire truck and you can earn money putting out fires. The minigames are a good way to unwind after a particularly difficult mission. With so much to do, the game just never gets boring.As you'd expect, there are consequences for criminality. As your random acts of mayhem mount up the police start hounding you, eventually calling in SWAT trucks, the FBI, and even the army if you continue down the path of destruction. Shaking these pursuers is easily the most fun part of the game, especially when a bunch of friends are packed in the room to witness your narrow escapes.Grand Theft Auto IIIis fine-tuned to near perfection in every category. All the vehicles, from slick sports cars to lumbering dump trucks, handle exactly as you'd expect and smash apart realistically when abused. The three islands in the game are rendered in terrific detail considering their size, and are packed with traffic, pedestrians, and hidden jumps. The audio is equally amazing. Pedestrians talk, cops scream at you, and you can tune in nine different radio stations whenever you are in a car. It all adds up to a monumental achievement: the rare console game for adults that manages to get everything right.--T. Byrl BakerGrand Theft Auto III: Vice CityHow big is this game? Even publicists for other games end up talking aboutVice Citywhen they call our office, babbling in the same helplessly intoxicated way that afflicts everyone who plays it. The achievement ofVice City(which, as everyone knows by now, is set in the 1980s and offers an all-new, Miami Vice-inspired story) is not only that it manages to live up to an absurd level of expectation, but that it takes the game places that fans of its predecessorGrand Theft Auto IIInever dreamed of, and that it achieves this astonishing level of innovation without losing anything that madeGTA3the bestselling PS2 game of all time.After a brilliant homage to the era of the Commodore 64 in the opening credits, the first thing you'll notice is the improved graphics, which are smoother and more detailed, and--with effects like neon lights reflected on rain-slick streets, and intense Florida sunlight--have a lush, tropical look that immediately gives you a strong sense of place. The architecture is more fabulous by tenfold, with art deco buildings, high-rise hotels, and believably seedy back alleys. The control scheme is essentially the same as inGTA3, but the cars handle much better, and in pedestrian mode there is a new crouch move. You will have access to fast, great-handling cars right away, as opposed toGTA3which made you unlock the second island before you could get your hands on any respectable wheels. This game has such riches to offer that there is no need to be chintzy with the vehicles.Cops are more vigilant this time--minor offenses like whacking innocent bystanders will more often than not get you a two-star wanted level--and are harder to elude (though they still can't seem to climb stairs or negotiate sharp turns). So while free-roaming exploration is as fun as ever, there is more incentive to perform the missions instead of randomly raising hell. Not that that's a bad thing: even lazy criminals like myself (inGTA3, I would rather toss hand grenades into traffic than follow orders from some rude Mafia boss) will be quickly caught up in the vivid characters and hilarious, fascinating story, in which you play an acid-washed-jeans-wearing thug named Tommy Vercetti. Where inGTA3missions were blocky, schematic affairs only nominally connected to the story, this time tasks move the story briskly along and deftly blend cinematics and game action. For example, there is a scene of a character throwing Tommy a gun, at which point you are suddenly thrown back into the action and must make an instant decision about whom to trust and what to do.There are more, and more detailed, indoor environments, including a hotel, police station, and mall (a slight downside to this is that some of the more elaborate indoor environments require load times). The layout of the city, with tons of backyards, narrow alleys, and fire escapes, encourages creativity when eluding pursuit, as does greater access to rooftops. Get your motorcycle up the fire escape and a whole new world of action is possible, including... well, use your imagination.This overview barely scratches the surface of theVice Cityexperience, its colorful explosion of music, clothes, combat, and brilliant voice acting, not to mention the plot twist midway through the game that changes the very nature of the game itself. Though it was the outrageous, amoral violence that got all the press, the essential genius ofGTA3was its intoxicating blend of script and open-ended action. InVice Citythis is--to use a clich&#xE9; that is for once apropos--taken to a whole new level.--David StoeszPros:Open-ended gameplay; player can chose to be relatively law-abiding or engage in wanton virtual destructionVaried missionsBrilliant scripts with Hollywood voice actingRocking sound track (also available in our Music store)Xbox-enhanced graphicsCons:As theThe Sopranosof games,GTA 3draws unwanted attention from overzealous legislatorsNo multiplayer",

        "0062200577": "*Starred Review* In Heart-Shaped Box (2007) and Horns (2010), Hill showed hints of an enlarging literary toolbox. With this 700-page opus, the tool set is complete, and Hill has indeed built something very big. The story follows Vic, from 8-year-old girl to troubled teen to embattled mother, as she struggles to survive as a &#x201C;strong creative&#x201D;&#x2014;one who has access (in her case, via a ramshackle bridge) to an alternate universe constructed from imagination. Problem is, a chief attraction of this other America is Christmasland, a snowy Neverland carnival controlled by cheery, ageless child-abductor Charlie Manx (think Bentley Little&#x2019;s Mailman or Stephen King&#x2019;s Pennywise). Manx tries to take Vic to Christmasland as a kid, and years later, in the book&#x2019;s central conflict, he tries to take her son. Hill doesn&#x2019;t spend much time in reality before careening deliriously off into a la-la land of horrifying absurdism (a bottomless Scrabble bag, a mouth full of fish-hook teeth). This engenders inelegance; at times, the parts are more than the whole. But Hill is omnivorous in his appetite for story and character, and here he has created his best: Lou, Vic&#x2019;s obese, warm-hearted lover; Bing, Manx&#x2019;s demented chief elf; and gutsy, heartbreaking Vic. Occasional drawings by Hill&#x2019;s Locke &amp; Key conspirator, Gabriel Rodriguez, add one more element to this vast and gangly but undeniably readable work.

The baby was Heidi, and they had come from the almost-empty apartment next door for help. Heidi's Mama can't tend her week-old child because she has, as Heidi later says, \"a bum brain,\" so Bernadette steps in and cares for them both tenderly. Mama says her name is \"So Be It,\" but with her twenty-three-word vocabulary, this is all the information she can give Bernadette.Twelve years later this strange but loving household is still together. Heidi does the shopping because Bernadette has \"angora phobia,\" and pays for it with money she wins at the laundromat; Bernadette teaches her at the kitchen table while Mama is happily occupied with her coloring books, and the rent and utilities are always mysteriously paid. But Heidi wonders who she is, where she and Mama came from, why they were alone, and most of all, she wants to know the meaning of Mama's word \"soof.\" When she finds some old photos in a cupboard, she knows where to go to find out, and as she sets out on a long cross-country bus journey, the pieces of the puzzle begin to fall into surprising places in this intriguing and heartwarming mystery.

In this book, the focus is on his neighbor Tom Hartwig, a man who has lived 82 years in one farmhouse in rural Wisconsin, on a farm that survived the construction of a four-lane interstate in its front yard in 1965. Tom, known for his hobby of building and occasionally firing cannons, offers pearls of wisdom on everything from living with whizzing traffic outside your kitchen window, to repairing tools ranging from massive farm equipment to shovel handles, to raising daughters. Perry relates his own farm life, including realizing that taking his daughter to swim in the local creek is more important than deadlines and appreciating the pleasure of odd tools as he sharpens a scythe (only to be told very matter-of-factly by Tom that a gas-powered weed whacker is better).

        "0060175400": "Oprah Book Club&#174; Selection, June 2000:As any reader ofThe Mosquito Coastknows, men who drag their families to far-off climes in pursuit of an Idea seldom come to any good, while those familiar withAt Play in the Fields of the LordorKalimantaanunderstand that the minute a missionary sets foot on the fictional stage, all hell is about to break loose. So when Barbara Kingsolver sends missionary Nathan Price along with his wife and four daughters off to Africa inThe Poisonwood Bible, you can be sure that salvation is the one thing they're not likely to find. The year is 1959 and the place is the Belgian Congo. Nathan, a Baptist preacher, has come to spread the Word in a remote village reachable only by airplane. To say that he and his family are woefully unprepared would be an understatement: \"We came from Bethlehem, Georgia, bearing Betty Crocker cake mixes into the jungle,\" says Leah, one of Nathan's daughters. But of course it isn't long before they discover that the tremendous humidity has rendered the mixes unusable, their clothes are unsuitable, and they've  arrived in the middle of political upheaval as the Congolese seek to wrest independence from Belgium. In addition to poisonous snakes, dangerous animals, and the hostility of the villagers to Nathan's fiery take-no-prisoners brand of Christianity, there are also rebels in the jungle and the threat of war in the air. Could things get any worse?In fact they can and they do. The first part ofThe Poisonwood Biblerevolves around Nathan's intransigent, bullying personality and his effect on both his family and the village they have come to. As political instability grows in the Congo, so does the local witch doctor's animus toward the Prices, and both seem to converge with tragic consequences about halfway through the novel. From that point on, the family is dispersed and the novel follows each member's fortune across a span of more than 30 years.The Poisonwood Bibleis arguably Barbara Kingsolver's most ambitious work, and it reveals both her great strengths and her weaknesses. As Nathan Price's wife and daughters tell their stories in alternating chapters, Kingsolver does a good job of differentiating the voices. But at times they can grate--teenage Rachel's tendency towards precious malapropisms is particularly annoying (students practice their \"French congregations\"; Nathan's refusal to take his family home is a \"tapestry of justice\"). More problematic is Kingsolver's tendency to wear her politics on her sleeve; this is particularly evident in the second half of the novel, in which she uses her characters as mouthpieces to explicate the complicated and tragic history of the Belgian Congo.Despite these weaknesses, Kingsolver's fully realized, three-dimensional characters makeThe Poisonwood Biblecompelling, especially in the first half, when Nathan Price is still at the center of the action. And in her treatment of Africa and the Africans she is at her best, exhibiting the acute perception, moral engagement, and lyrical prose that have made her previous novels so successful.--Alix Wilber",

On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, doubters say it would be suicide.

As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races; a more realistic damage system; a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage; a regenerative health system; a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard; and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. In doing this, the decisions that were made in the first game will affect the events of the second game.

On the other hand, new players coming to the series for the first time inMass Effect 2will start a brand-new character, discover the events of the previous games as they progress and embark on a thrilling stand-alone adventure that does not require the previous game for play.Key FeaturesFuturistic Weapons- Choose from 19 different weapons, including devastating heavy weapons that can end a battle in seconds.Elite Specialists- Recruit up to a dozen of the galaxy's most dangerous operatives to help you in your mission.

I give it now to my children and grandchildren, and to yours, so they will always know what it was like in America when people were free.Since the publication of her bestselling memoir,Going Rogue, in 2009, former Alaska governor Sarah Palin has traveled the country extensively. She has visited cities and towns in almost every state, dropped in on military bases, given talks and speeches to small groups and at massive rallies. Throughout her travels, she has been privileged to meet thousands of Americans&mdash;ordinary men and women who have shared with her their hopes and dreams, their love of country, and their fears about what lies ahead. Governor Palin, inspired by these encounters, celebrates in her new book the enduring strengths and virtues that have made this country a beacon of liberty and hope for the rest of the world.America by Heartis a highly personal testament to her deep love of country, her strong roots in faith, and her profound appreciation of family. Ranging widely over American history, culture, and current affairs, Governor Palin reflects on the key values that have been such an essential part of her own life and that continue to inform her vision of America&rsquo;s future. The book also includes brief readings from classic and contemporary texts that have moved and inspired her, as well as portraits of Americans, both famous and obscure, whom she admires.Informed by Palin&rsquo;s own principles and deepest feelings, graced with intimate memories, this remarkable book gives us a close-up view of an extraordinary woman who is not afraid to speak out and defend the American values in which she so deeply believes.A Look InsideAmerica by HeartClick on the images below to open larger versions.I play with 19-month-old Trigwhile Bristol supports her one-year-old son, Tripp, on his toy elephant during Tripp&rsquo;s birthday party in our Wasilla home.(Photo &copy; Shealah Craighead)After an interview near the Statue of LibertyGlenn Beck and I pose for Fox Newson January 13, 2010.

No, wait&hellip; My new book,Call Me Irresistible, is coming out on January 18, 2011, so it&rsquo;s time to talk about how wonderful I am. Except I shamefully tried to do exactly that in our last interview, which was about you and your fabulousMaybe This Time, which was such a delicious read that I devoured it in one evening. Truly. It was better than chocolate, so funny and heartwarming, which, let&rsquo;s face it, is a hard task for even the most gifted writer to pull off, but you did it, babe, and I have no idea why I tried to sabotage that interview. I&rsquo;m ashamed.Back to me. So go ahead. Ask me some questions. Make them easy. I&rsquo;m not half as smart as you. But I&rsquo;ll put my banana bread up against yours any day.Love,SusanA Letter from Jennifer Crusie to Susan Elizabeth PhillipsDear Susan,My banana bread leaves your banana bread sniveling in the pan from its inadequacy. However, I might write another book again someday and then you&rsquo;ll owe ME an interview, so I won&rsquo;t mention that. HA. And I will be Adult and not make the interview about me.Love,JennyAmazon Exclusive: Jennifer Crusie Interviews Susan Elizabeth PhillipsJennifer Crusie:Welcome to Jennifer Crusie&rsquo;s interview with her Close Personal Friend, Susan Elizabeth Phillips. I&rsquo;m Jenny Crusie and I&rsquo;m thrilled to be interviewing Susan because she&rsquo;s not only my Close Personal Friend, she&rsquo;s also the Queen of Romantic Comedy! Oh, and because she has a new book coming out. And because that&rsquo;s what Close Personal Friends do.  So Susan, tell us aboutMaybe This Time.Susan Elizabeth Phillips:Sigh&hellip; Once you tell your Close Personal Friend how much you love her book, she never lets you forget it.JC:Sorry, sorry, I meantCall Me Irresistible. What was I thinking?  Probably that &ldquo;irresistible&rdquo; is a bitch to spell, unlike &ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; &ldquo;This,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Time.&rdquo; So you have a new novel coming out FINALLY. Not that I&rsquo;ve been impatient or anything, but ye gods, woman, you have fans and none of us are getting any younger. What took you so long? And when do I get my Close Personal Friend of Susan Elizabeth Phillips copy?SEP:So glad you pointed out the difficulty of spelling &ldquo;irresistible.&rdquo;  Where was my brain? As for taking so long&hellip; Writing is hard! Didn&rsquo;t anybody ever tell you that? (An advanced copy of the book is coming to you in the mail. Along with a truly superb loaf of banana bread.)JC:Sorry, sorry, I&rsquo;m just thrilled thatCall Me Irresistibleis coming out. Finally. For one thing, I get to see some of my favorite characters again like Meg fromWhat I Did for Loveand Lucy fromFirst Lady, not to mention Ted fromFancy PantsandLady Be Good. Is it fun for you to revisit them? (Not that I care, it&rsquo;s fun for me, so bring them back anyway, that&rsquo;s what I say.) Oh, and will readers have to have read all those books to understand this one? Because if so, good marketing.SEP:I love revisiting old characters. Just like revisiting old friends. (Not that we&rsquo;re old. Or even remotely mature.) The thing about my books is that they all stand alone, even those with familiar characters. And, boy, doesCall Me Irresistiblehave a lot of familiar characters. If readers want to pick up the older books, more power to them. But they don&rsquo;t have to. That would be like homework. Except more fun.JC:You remember back when I told you not to marry Charles and you got all huffy about it? Meg does the same thing to Lucy in this book and she listens. What kind of heroine tries to break up her pal&rsquo;s wedding? (Tell Charles I said hi.)SEP:My husband&rsquo;s name is Bill, not Charles. (This interview isn&rsquo;t going nearly as well as I&rsquo;d hoped.) Meg, the heroine ofCall Me Irresistible, sees clearly what Lucy Jorik, the bride, can&rsquo;t&mdash;that Lucy and Ted Beaudine aren&rsquo;t the perfect match everyone believes them to be. Lucy flees her wedding just as she&rsquo;s supposed to be saying, &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; leaving Meg to face the wrath of Wynette, Texas&hellip; and Ted Beaudine.JC:Okay, the last time I saw Ted he was a kid, so his appeal as a leading man wasn&rsquo;t evident (cute, though) but now he sounds like The Perfect Man: a civic minded, athletic, sweet, rich genius. Did Meg turn into superwoman in between books to earn this paragon? Because I&rsquo;m feeling inadequate enough without having to live up to a Perfect Heroine.SEP:Not to worry. As you pointed out, Ted really does have it all: looks, money, charm, and that annoying genius I.Q. As for Meg&hellip; Unlike our sexy paragon of a hero, Meg is so deliciously imperfect. Kind of a screw-up, although her heart&rsquo;s in the right place. She also has big problems. She&rsquo;s broke, stranded, and unemployed in a town where everybody&rsquo;s out to get her&hellip;and where Ted Beaudine holds all the power.JC:What is it with you and Texans? Not that I have anything against Texas except, you know, politics, but you&rsquo;re practically a tumbleweed groupie. Did you have a great one-night stand there that you&rsquo;ve never quite let go of? Did you look across a room and meet the eyes of a tall, dark ranger and then Charles made you play golf? Because your erotic fascination with that state is well-documented. Give us all the details. And pictures. Pictures or it didn&rsquo;t happen.SEP:My husband&rsquo;s name is NOT CHARLES, it&rsquo;s BILL! And who are you calling a groupie? I seem to remember a certain wild night, a certain famous rocker&hellip; I&rsquo;ll say no more. As for my Texas settings&mdash;and no offense to my Lone Star friends&mdash;but that state is a writer&rsquo;s dream. You can make any dang fool thing happen in Texas and readers will believe it. Thank you Sam Houston and all your fine descendents.JC:I never had a chance to be a groupie once you told him I threw rolls at you. You asked me some really good questions in our last Amazon interview (smart, talented, and beautiful; you really do have it all, oh Queen of the RomCom), so I&rsquo;m throwing two of the best back at you: &ldquo;How do the stories you want to tell now differ from the ones you wanted to tell when you started writing? How are they the same?&rdquo;SEP:Do I detect a little sarcasm with all these Queen references? I should never have borrowed your tiara. Great, insightful questions, by the way! (Please don&rsquo;t bring up the roll incident.) My core story will, I think, always be the same. I love books that make me laugh and get a lump in my throat, sometimes on the same page. I love sexy heroes, funny heroines, and happy endings. Basically, there&rsquo;s not much difference between what I used to write and what I write now. Except now I&rsquo;m a lot better speller.JC:Thank you, Susan for these insightful and fascinating answers.  And now for our last question: WHAT&rsquo;S NEXT?  Tell me all about what you&rsquo;re working on so I can harass you so you can finish it faster and I can read it.

        "B000HKP88C": "What does the American Dream mean today?For Niko Bellic, fresh off the boat from Europe, it is the hope he can escape his past. For his cousin, Roman, it is the vision that together they can find fortune in Liberty City, gateway to the land of opportunity. As they slip into debt and are dragged into a criminal underworld by a series of shysters, thieves and sociopaths, they discover that the reality is very different from the dream in a city that worships money and status, and is heaven for those who have them and a living nightmare for those who don&#146;t.Beginning with the 1997 release of the originalGrand Theft Auto, theGTAseries has been one of the most prolific, controversial and down right entertaining franchises in video games history. This pedigree of success guarantees that the highly anticipated eleventh game in the series,Grand Theft Auto IV, will garner at least as much attention if not more.Return to Liberty City.The dream as Niko expected it.View larger.There's always a catch.View larger.But some skills are international.View larger.The PlotGrand Theft Auto IVis a brand new adventure in theGTAuniverse following the experiences of Nikolai \"Niko\" Bellic, a new immigrant from an undisclosed eastern European country whose troubled pa st and the persuasion of his cousin Roman have brought him to the fictional Liberty City. Unfortunately, Niko&#146;s search for the American Dream and a much needed fresh start, hits an immediate snag when the rags to riches story Roman spun to pique Niko's interest is exposed as not only a complete fabrication, but a ploy to enlist Niko&#146;s well-known skills as a tough guy against the ample list of enemies clamoring for Roman&#146;s debt-ridden blood.Because Roman is the only person Niko knows in Liberty City he begrudgingly accepts his role as Roman&#146;s protector despite the deception. But as time goes on Niko comes into his own, and his experience on the wrong side of the tracks proves more valuable than he could have ever imagined as he fights for survival and later supremacy on the crime ridden streets of Liberty City.Game EnvironmentsBased on several of the boroughs of New York City and parts of New Jersey, Liberty City, familiar to players of previous games in the series, has been entirely redesigned forGTA IV. Players can expect visible detail down to the weeds growing in the cracks in the sidewalk, cars and buildings of visibly different ages and a much greater level if verticality in the buildings and bridges that they are able to explore as Niko moves through the city streets. In addition, pedestrians inGTA IVare much more realistic. No longer simply moving cardboard cutouts, these NPCs are intelligent, modern, human representations that laugh, cry, eat, drink, use cell phones and ATMs, and talking amongst themselves regardless of Niko&#146;s interaction with them.GameplayHistoricallyGTAgames have focused heavily on mission-based play, requiring successful completion of fixed tasks in order for players to progress through the game, but this has changed to a great extent inGTA IV. Players will experience an entirely new and exciting emphasis centered on the blending of on-mission and off-mission play, resulting not only in an increased sense of realism, but more interesting and unrestricted gameplay.FeaturesAside from the car jacking and a detailed city environment here are the new features forGTA IV:Improved combat system - Now you can use cover and also a target lock system, which allows you to take out targets with greater ease and accuracy. Plus, you can engage in some hand-to-hand combat if you can't get your hands on a piece quick enough.Cell phone - Not just for basic phone calls anymore. Use your in-game cell phone to receive missions via SMS, snap photos, and ZiT (tag) songs that can be downloaded exclusively on Amazon.com/mp3.Free time - In between missions you can take advantage of \"me\" time. There are gentleman's clubs, comedy clubs, bowling alleys, and bars, which all house unique activities.Take a break from the storyline - A variety of side missions allow you to help run a car service, \"borrow\" cop cars, assassinate targets, help solve problems for those on the street, or take to the air with stunt jumps that are scattered all over the city.Control your own fate - Throughout the game choice moments will arrive causing you to make a decision that will affect relationships and money.MultiplayerGive Niko a rest and create your own multiplayer \"hero.\"GTAhas added multiplayer modes allowing you to take your creation out to play online in competitive, co-op, and free form modes. Competitive mode has you fighting against the cops, jacking cars, or racing to finish odd jobs. Co-op challenges you and your friends with various tasks including Hangman's NOOSE where you are responsible for escorting a wanted kingpin to a safe extraction point. Freeform lets you and 15 others lose on Liberty City. Use this mode to hit up the bar and play virtual darts versus each other or head out to the streets and set up your own drag races. If you can dream it, you can do it in Freeform mode.ZiT: We'll Spot The Song For YouWhen playing Grand Theft Auto IV, if you hear a song that you are interested in buying as an MP3, all you have to do is dial ZiT-555-0100 on your in-game mobile phone and a text message will be sent to you with the name of the artist and the title of the track. The next time you log in at theRockstar Games Social Club, you will find 30-second previews of all the songs you have ZiT'ed while playing the game.

        "0061119741": "Until Chrysanthemum started kindergarten, she believed her parents when they said her name  was perfect. But on the first day of school, Chrysanthemum begins to suspect that her name is far less than  perfect, especially when her class dissolves into giggles upon hearing her name read aloud. That evening,  Chrysanthemum's parents try to piece her self-esteem back together again with comfort food and a night  filled \"with hugs, kisses, and Parcheesi.\" But the next day Victoria, a particularly observant and mean-spirited classmate, announces that Chrysanthemum's name takes up 13 letters. \"That's half the letters in the  alphabet!\" she adds. Chrysanthemum wilts. Pretty soon the girls are making playground threats to \"pluck\" Chrysanthemum and \"smell her.\"Kevin Henkes has great compassion for the victims of childhood teasing and cruelties--using fresh language,  endearing pen-and-ink mouse characters, and realistic dialogue to portray real-life vulnerability. He also has  great compassion for parents, offering several adult-humor jokes for anxious mommies and daddies. On the  surface, the finale is overly tidy and the coincidences unbelievable. But in the end, what sustains  Chrysanthemum, as well as this story, is the steadfast love and support of her family. And because of this,  the closure is ultimately convincing and utterly comforting. ALA Notable Book,School Library  JournalBest Book of the Year,Horn BookFanfare Honor List.

        "0060081961": "Millions of American soldiers, many of whom had never left their hometowns before, crossed the nation by rail during the years of World War II on their way to training camps and distant theaters of battle. In a little town in Nebraska, countless thousands of them met with extraordinary hospitality--the \"miracle\" of veteran journalist Bob Greene's title. \"The best America there ever was. Or at least, whatever might be left of it.\" So Greene writes of North Platte, now a quiet town along the interstate, its main street all but dead. It was a quiet town then, too, at the outbreak of the war, but still a hive of activity as its citizens gathered to provide, at their own expense, coffee, sandwiches, books, playing cards, and time to the scared young men who rolled through by the trainload, \"telling them that their country cared about them.\" Greene's pages are full of the voices of those who were there, soldiers and townspeople alike, who took part in what amounted to small acts of heroism, given the shortages and rationing of the time. Greene, generous in his praise if rather disheartened by the modern world, against which he contrasts the past, turns in a remarkable account of the home front. It deserves the widest audience.---Gregory McNamee",

Li Lan prefers to rebuff the unusual offer despite its implications of good social standing and financial rescue for her money-strapped family. But when her dreams are brusquely invaded by the rather unsavory dead man, Lim Tian Ching, she realizes she may already be in over her head. Her dead suitor&#x2019;s living cousin, Tian Bai, now the family heir, further complicates matters as Li Lan wrestles with her very real attraction to him. As the angry ghost becomes more possessive in her dreams, and his family more demanding that she marry him, Li Lan&#x2019;s involvement with the Lim family becomes even murkier and potentially dangerous. With its gripping tangles of plot and engaging characters, this truly compelling read is sure to garner much well-deserved attention. --Julie Trevelyan",

Where there are gods galore, there are priests, high and low, and... there are novices.

        "0060567104": "Medical examiner Sara Linton and police chief Jeffrey Tolliver make their fourth appearance in this riveting new back-and-forth thriller that grounds a brutal attack by two young men on the Grant County, Georgia police department in a twelve-year-old Alabama murder case that occurred while Sara and Jeffrey were just beginning their tumultuous romance. En route to a beach vacation shortly after they meet, the couple takes a detour to the small town where Jeffrey grew up and began his law enforcement career. But their carefree holiday is interrupted when his best friend from childhood, a fellow cop, is charged with murder after killing a man who broke into his house. Despite his subsequent confession, Jeffrey believes there&#x92;s more to the story than Robert is telling him, and when the skeleton of a young woman with whom both Robert and Tolliver were once involved is discovered in a secret cave only they knew about, and Robert admits to her murder too, Tolliver must again confront a past he thought he had long since put behind him.Slaughter unravels a convoluted story deftly and smoothly as the action moves between those long-ago events and the siege of the police station by two young men who are determined to make Jeffrey pay for a crime they believe he committed. Threatening to kill whoever stands between them and their target--including eight children on a school field trip at the station house when the bloody siege begins--they execute a deputy they mistakenly believe is Tolliver. Skillfully blending past and present events and illuminating the equally convoluted relationship between Sara and Jeffrey (who have married and divorced in the intervening years) without interrupting the breathtaking pace of the action or dropping a beat, Slaughter takes this series to a new level of excellence.--Jane Adams",
        "0060573775": "Kurt Vonnegut's absurdist classicSlaughterhouse-Fiveintroduces us to Billy Pilgrim, a man who becomes unstuck in time after he is abducted by aliens from the planet Tralfamadore. In a plot-scrambling display of virtuosity, we follow Pilgrim simultaneously through all phases of his life, concentrating on his (and Vonnegut's) shattering experience as an American prisoner of war who witnesses the firebombing of Dresden.Don't let the ease of reading fool you--Vonnegut's isn't a conventional, or simple, novel. He writes, &quot;There are almost no characters in this story, and almost no dramatic confrontations, because most of the people in it are so sick, and so much the listless playthings of enormous forces. One of the main effects of war, after all, is that people are discouraged from being characters...&quot;Slaughterhouse-Five(taken from the name of the building where the POWs were held) is not only Vonnegut's most powerful book, it is as important as any written since 1945. LikeCatch- 22, it fashions the author's experiences in the Second World War into an eloquent and deeply funny plea against butchery in the service of authority.Slaughterhouse-Fiveboasts the same  imagination, humanity, and gleeful appreciation of the absurd found in Vonnegut's other works, but the book's basis in rock-hard, tragic fact gives it a unique poignancy--and humor.--This text refers to theMass Market Paperbackedition.",

Then Mia's dad comes to town, and  drops a major bomb. Turns out he's not just a European politician as he's always  lead her to believe, but actually the prince of a small country! And Mia, his  only heir, is now considered the crown princess of Genovia! She doesn't even  know how to begin to cope: \"I am so NOT a princess.... You never saw anyone who  looked less like a princess than I do.

If he succeeds, he'll be rewarded. If he fails, he will be killed. If he runs away, he will be hunted down. Half prisoner, half outlaw legend, Gen goes along with the king's assistant in the risky plan. Set in a semi-Mediterranean realm of old and new gods and goddesses, this compelling adventure propels readers along through the enemy lands of Sounis, Eddis and Attolia. Gen, a beguiling narrator, is afraid of horses but not of entering a locked labyrinth; he comes from a long line of thieves but puts honor first. Turner's (Instead of Three Wishes) device of having Gen and others tell god and goddess stories around the campfire bumpily draws the reader away from the main story, yet the plot is strong enough to survive the wanderings. In addition to its charismatic hero, this story possesses one of the most valuable treasures of all-a twinkling jewel of a surprise ending .

After beating up a ninth-grade  classmate to the point of brain damage, Cole is facing a prison sentence. But  then a Tlingit Indian parole officer named Garvey enters his life, offering an  alternative called Circle Justice, based on Native American traditions, in which  victim, offender, and community all work together to find a healing solution.  Privately, Cole sneers at the concept, but he's no fool--if it gets him out of  prison, he'll do anything. Ultimately, Cole ends up banished for one year to a  remote Alaskan island, where his arrogance sets him directly in the path of a  mysterious, legendary white bear. Mauled almost to death, Cole awaits his fate  and begins the transition from anger to humility.Ben Mikaelsen's depiction of a juvenile delinquent's metamorphosis into a  caring, thinking individual is exciting and fascinating, if at times  heavy-handed. Cole's nastiness and the vivid depictions of the lengths he must  go to survive after the (equally vivid) attack by the bear are excruciating at  times, but the concept of finding a way to heal a whole community when one  individual wrongs another is compelling.

The setup is familiar: strong-willed American heiress Lillian Bowman gets under the skin of straitlaced earl Marcus Westcliff, and soon finds herself sharing the sheets with him. But what distinguishes this book from a multitude of similar stories are Kleypas's characters. One can imagine the mouthy Lillian as a regular onSex and the Cityand, with his contemporary sensibilities and hunky good looks, Marcus could easily win the heart of a modern woman. Indeed, while the protagonists are both hardheaded in a typical way and their path toward love is peppered with few surprises, it's no chore to sit back and be amused by their antics and engrossed in their struggles. Even if this romance isn't as fresh as the first book in Kleypas's Wallflowers series,Secrets of a Summer Night, the charismatic characters&mdash;including Lillian's pert sister and chatty, mischievous friends&mdash;ensure that it's never boring.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0060722282": "Oates is not only on her authentically rendered home ground in this sprawling novel set in the city of Niagara Falls during the 1950s, she is also writing at the top of her form. Her febrile prose is especially appropriate to a story as turbulent as the tumultuous waters that have claimed many lives over the years. Widowed on her wedding night when her new husband, a young minister and latent homosexual, throws himself into the falls, Ariah Littrell, the plain, awkward daughter of a minister, henceforth considers herself damned. Her bleak future becomes miraculously bright when Dirk Burnaby, a handsome, wealthy bon vivant with an altruistic heart, falls in love with the media-dubbed Widow-Bride. Their rapturous happiness is shadowed only by Ariah's illogical conviction over the years that Dirk will leave her and their three children someday. Her unreasonable fear becomes self-fulfilling when her increasingly unstable behavior, combined with Dirk's obsessed but chaste involvement with Nina Olshaker, a young mother who enlists his help in alerting the city fathers to the pestilential conditions in the area later to be known as Love Canal, opens a chasm in their marriage. His gentle heart inspired by a need for justice, Dirk takes on the powerful, corrupt politicians, his former peers and pals, in a disastrous lawsuit that ruins him socially and financially and results in his death. Oates adroitly addresses the material of this \"first\" class action lawsuit and makes the story fresh and immediate. \"In the end, all drama is about family,\" a character muses, and while the narrative occasionally lapses into melodrama in elucidating this theme, Oates spins a haunting story in which nature and humans are equally rapacious and self-destructive.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The dominant soul is supposed to take over, and the recessive, or weaker one is supposed to disappear, usually by the time the child is six. But even though Addie was the stronger soul, Eva held on. Despite the fact that she could no longer move or speak to anyone but Addie, she didn't go away. Now that they are teens, Addie and Eva have adopted rules of behavior in order to survive: don't stand out, don't be exceptional, blend in at all costs. But then the girls become friends with Hally and her brother, Devon, and the siblings show the sisters that there's another way to live-Eva can reemerge. But Eva's freedom comes at high price: imprisonment in a hospital that wants to \"cure\" kids of being hybrids and where patients who \"go home\" are never heard from again. This uniquely imagined novel doesn't fall short in the execution. Zhang's prose is lovely, and the plot is compelling to the last page. If there's one complaint to be made it's that the differences in characterization of the hybrid siblings are very subtle, and it's occasionally difficult to immediately see the change when different personalities take over.

        "0061147931": "Do you sleep with the light on? Are you in the habit of checking your doors and windows before you go to bed? Maybe even checkingunderyour bed? If you are about to crack open Joe Hill's chilling thrillerHeart-Shaped Box, you might want to rethink your nighttime habits--Hill's story about an aging rock star (with a penchant for macabre artifacts) who buys a haunted suit online will scare you silly. But don't take our word for it. We asked bestselling authors (and masters of dark terror tales themselves)Scott Smith, andHarlan Cobento readHeart-Shaped Boxand give us their take. Check out their reviews below, and you might want to pick up anightlightwhile you're at it.--Daphne DurhamGuest Reviewer: Scott SmithIn 1993, Scott Smith wowed readers with his stunning debut thriller,A Simple Plan.  Thirteen years later, he spooked us again withThe Ruins, a horror-thriller about four Americans traveling in Mexico who stumble across a nightmare in the jungle.The set-up for Joe Hill's novel,Heart-Shaped Box, is appealingly simple. Jude Coyne, an aging rock star, buys himself a dead man's suit. He acquires it online, lured by the promise that the dead man's ghost will be included in his purchase. Jude thinks this is a joke, of course. He also assumes the seller is a stranger. We soon discover that he's wrong on both counts, however, and from this point on the story moves with an exhilarating urgency. Jude wants the ghost gone; the ghost wants Jude dead. We watch, chapter-by-chapter, as they battle for survival. \"Watch\" is the appropriate word, too, because this is an extremely visual book. Hill's prose is lean and precise, and he renders Jude's world with impressive confidence. It feels solid, every detail both correct and fresh. And this physicality provides a firm platform for the book's otherworldly happenings, which seem all the more frightening for being so securely grounded.Hill has a flawless sense of pacing. His narrative never flags, nor does it ever move so quickly as to outrun itself. And one can sense his literary ambition pushing at the margins of the genre. There are times when his writing, for all its spare efficiency, seems to jump away from him, stopping one small step short of poetry. An e-mail to Jude from the ghost (trust me, it's not as absurd as it sounds) could even pass for something ee cummings might've written, in an especially morbid mood. And toward the end of the book, when Hill describes a trip down death's \"night road\" in a '65 Mustang, the passage has a startlingly lyrical beauty.The story's horror ultimately has as much to do with Jude Coyne's past--his mistakes, abandonments and betrayals--as with anything supernatural. Jude has caused a lot of pain over the years, moving through life with a carelessness that verges on the callous. His battle with the ghost brings this behavior into sharp relief, forcing him to reflect upon his own capacity for cruelty. This dawning self-awareness leavens the book's bleakness and gore (and it is delightfully gory in places) with an unexpected sweetness. Despite our initial impression, Jude is gradually revealed--both to himself and the reader--as an essentially decent, even kind man. It's this kindness, this fledgling ability to love and be loved, that will ultimately be of crucial consequence in his death struggle with the ghost. And it's what makes Hill's debut not only well-written and terrifying, but also--as it draws to its close--surprisingly moving. So go ahead, take a chance, and open hisHeart-Shaped Box. I think you&#x92;ll be happy you did.--Scott SmithGuest Reviewer: Harlan CobenHarlan Cobenis the author of the belovedMyron Bolitarseries about a wisecracking sports agent, as well as stunning stand-alone novels likeThe Innocentand his breakout thrillerTell No One. His new novelThe Woodsreleases on April 17, 2007.You, dear reader, are obviously somewhat versed in making online purchases, so today, immediately after you click on the yellow \"Add to Shopping Cart\" on the top right hand corner of this page, why not do an online search and buy something totally unique?Like, say, a vengeful ghost.That is what rock-star Judas Coyne does, thinking it will be a laugh, fun for his \"sick-o\" collection of such things. It seems a random buy, but Judas soon learns that it is anything but. This particular ghost is one Craddock McDermott, step-father to recent suicide victim and boy, is he cranky. He demands revenge for his step-daughter&#x92;s death, which he blames on Judas&#x92;s shabby treatment of her.Or is he after something else?There are Amazon readers who will give you a better plot summary. Don't read them too closely because Joe Hill provides plenty of fun surprises.Heart-Shaped Boxis a true spine-tingler.  I don&#x92;t use that hyphenated word much anymore. We have seen and read it all, haven't we?  But right away, in the first chapter, there was a subtle line that made the hairs on the back of my neck go up in a way I haven't experienced since I first discovered great horror as a teenager.Hill writes with a sure hand. The prose is compelling. Like most memorable tales of horror, this book is more about redemption than scary moments--thoughHeart-Shaped Boxhas plenty of scares. They are visceral, shocking and very well done. The characters are flawed and real. The father-son relationship adds texture and surprising poignancy.So here's the thing. My guess is, you won&#x92;t find a ghost to buy online, but if you read theHeart-Shaped Box, you will be getting something that will haunt you and startle you and stay with you and yes, visit you in your dreams.Sleep well, dear reader.--Harlan Coben",
        "0061030120": "On a quest both professional and personal, biographer Ellie Connor accepts the invitation of experimental botanist and music lover Laurence \"Blue\" Reynard and heads for Pine Bend, TX, to gather information on an obscure Thirties blues singer and, if she can, learn something about her unknown father. However, her search nets her far more than she expects, and Ellie is suddenly faced with a surprising family, the answer to a mysterious disappearance, and a love she never hoped to find. Compelling, complex protagonists, three-dimensional secondary characters, and a simmering sexual tension result in an intense, poignant, and beautifully rendered romance that is also filled with rural small- town ambiance and threaded with descriptions so vivid that the seductive sounds of the blues and the sultry heat of a Southern summer almost rise from the pages.

If she enters rehab and spies on a fallen starlet for a tell-all article, she&#x2019;ll get another chance. But what starts as an unusual gig soon leads Katie into some surprising friendships, an attraction to a kindly but distant celebrity manager, and painful insights about her troubled family life and her long-denied alcoholism. While the ending is obvious from the first page, McKenzie endows what could have been a formulaic, tired plot with finely drawn characters, broad humor, and a sweet and satisfying romance between equals. Her descriptions of rehab are as candid as they are sympathetic. She laughs with her characters at the pain, frustration, and, at times, absurdity of the recovery process, which here includes a stint on a trapeze, without laughing at the misery and destructive behavior that bring people to treatment. Her relentless positivity is contagious. She is a writer to watch. --JoSelle Vanderhooft",
        "0061950726": "A long journey from home and the struggle to find it again form the heart of the intertwined stories that make up this moving novel. Foster teen Molly is performing community-service work for elderly widow Vivian, and as they go through Vivian&#x2019;s cluttered attic, they discover that their lives have much in common. When Vivian was a girl, she was taken to a new life on an orphan train. These trains carried children to adoptive families for 75 years, from the mid-nineteenth century to the start of the Great Depression. Novelist Kline (Bird in Hand, 2009) brings Vivian&#x2019;s hardscrabble existence in &#xAD;Depression-era Minnesota to stunning life. Molly&#x2019;s present-day story in Maine seems to pale in comparison, but as we listen to the two characters talk, we find grace and power in both of these seemingly disparate lives. Although the girls are vulnerable, left to the whims of strangers, they show courage and resourcefulness. Kline illuminates a largely hidden chapter of American history, while portraying the coming-of-age of two resilient young women. --Bridget Thoreson",

Narrated by a household slave named Tiro, who actually served as Cicero's \"confidential secretary\" for 36 years, this fictional biography follows the statesman and orator from his early career as an outsider&mdash;a \"new man\" from the provinces&mdash;to his election to the consulship, Rome's highest office, in 64 B.C. Loathed by the aristocrats, Cicero lived by his wits in a tireless quest for imperium&mdash;the ultimate power of life and death&mdash;and achieves \"his life's ambition\" after uncovering a plot by Marcus Crassus and Julius Caesar to rig the elections and seize control of the government. Harris's description of Rome's labyrinthine, and sometimes deadly, political scene is fascinating and instructive. The action is relentless, and readers will be disappointed when Harris leaves Cicero at the moment of his greatest triumph.

A self-described research junkie, she has parlayed her interest in police procedure, cutting edge forensics and twisted plots into a streak of eleven bestselling suspense novels, including her most recent release,Love You More.&nbsp;Lisa Gardner:First, the question I&rsquo;ve always wanted to ask another author: Where do you get your ideas?Andrew Gross:It's just that if I told you I&rsquo;d have to kill you Lisa, and you're so nice&hellip;   Actually, as we both know, that process varies, and every author has his or her own path. You just pray like hell they come when you need them!For me, this is the hardest and most stressful hurdle in what I do. The writing comes easy! For my last three books, I took conspiratorial headlines from the news&mdash;Iraq War scandals; people who used 9/11 to disappear from their life; the Wall Street financial meltdown&mdash;and wrapped them around more local and personal stories: a harrowing home invasion gone tragically wrong or a wife who wakes up one day to find her dead husband wasn't at all the person she thought she knew. Stories that I thought could achieve the emotional resonance I strive for in my books.Eyes Wide Opentook shape from two real life events straight from my own past. One was the sad suicide of my young nephew, a troubled kid, who was found at the bottom of a landmark cliff in central California. The second was a chance encounter forty years ago with none other than, ahem, Charles Manson! You&rsquo;ll have to read it to see how these stories link.Blind Curve, the book I&rsquo;m working on now, sprang from a crazy incident that happened to me last year while on my book tour. I was pulled out of my car for a minor traffic violation&mdash;an incident that escalated into my being thrown into cuffs and told I was going to jail. Except in my story, the hero doesn't get off as easily as I did.As long as events like these keep happening to me, I&rsquo;ll be in good shape!LG:Your last novel,Reckless, was a &ldquo;ripped from the headlines&rdquo; sort of novel, whereasEyes Wide Opendraws from events in your life. What prompted you to pull from your personal experiences this time around, and how hard was that to write?AG:It's much, much, much harder to write a story from your own life that affects real people, and some of them people you care for&mdash;especially those who have suffered tragedy, like me brother. On the other hand, drawing from personal experience makes for a much more enriching and rewarding story, one that is filled with the detail and resonance of real life. I wanted to write a poignant, personal testament to my nephew that was also a thriller, using a theme I seem to carry from book to book&mdash;a family hiding a secret past; in this case, revolving around teenage suicide, sons fighting against their fathers, the L.A. music scene in the &rsquo;60s, and an encounter with that Manson-like figure. Hopefully what came out is a chilling, rich, autobiographical, and satisfying tale filled with the kind of richness and family lore that you usually find in a memoir. While writingEyes Wide Openfrom events in my own life was tough, and awkward&mdash;and you know you may not please everyone&mdash;to me, it became more rewarding in the end.LG:OK, so you mentioned that as a child you had a passing encounter with Charles Manson, which helped inspireEyes Wide Open. Say what?AG:Okay. I go back and forth on this.Eyes Wide Openisn't a book about Manson, or even a Manson-like character, though a cultish figure is a chilling detail in the book. My dad moved out to L.A. in the &rsquo;60s and my older brother, a wayward spirit trying to become a musician, was out there as well, and, uh, took up residence on the Spahn Ranch, where Manson lived. At that time, Charlie was also trying to get his music produced. The two of them came up to my father's place one day and tried to sell him on anteing up for a demo. Manson was gaunt, quiet, creepy&mdash;and yes, he had those dark eyes. Though, at that time, Charlie Manson hadn't become the infamous &ldquo;Charles Manson&rdquo; yet! The scene eventually turned ugly&mdash;which I describe in the book&mdash;and they left, humiliated and angry. For years, my dad always insisted that the clan went up into the canyons that night looking to pay him back for what took place, but got lost in the L.A. hills and ended up at Sharon Tate&rsquo;s. Truth was, by that time my brother was long gone and, of course, there were other reasons the Manson clan ended up at Sharon Tate&rsquo;s house. But it makes a chilling scene!LG:Having followed your novels sinceThe Dark Tide, I&rsquo;ve noticed that you&rsquo;re drawn to stories involving complex family dynamics. What is it about this theme that resonates so strongly for you, and how has your own experience as a father influenced your writing?AG:I don't like writing straight-up thrillers. I like writing about families hurled into crisis and danger&mdash;soccer moms and regular dads and husbands who might have to rescue their daughters or who are, say, hedge fund managers and have one foot on the sidelines watching their kids and the other in nefarious cover-ups and conspiracies. These are the &ldquo;real life&rdquo; stories that intrigue me and provide the basis for the emotional complexity I&rsquo;m looking for. As for being a dad, it makes you know exactly what you would do&mdash;basically anything&mdash;to save your own family. And how creepy and evil one has to be to betray theirs!LG:One thriller writer to another, what draws you to suspense&mdash;and what&rsquo;s your favorite thing about thrillers?AG:You know what, Lisa, you can make a strong case that thriller writing is the single most relevant genre of fiction being written today, because it reflects the conflicts and crises and stories that we read every day in the news and that shape our world. The people who come to our craft aren&rsquo;t just graduate students, or MFA candidates or teachers, but CIA agents and journalists and doctors and lawyers whose experiences in life inform their work. As for suspense, I like to write books that draw you into the hero&rsquo;s plight from the opening pages, where people put their lives on the line for something&mdash;a belief, a family member, the truth. I&rsquo;m actually more into heroism than evil&mdash;but it's hard to have one without the other and when their arcs meet and they clash... well, there's suspense!LG:Without giving too much away, what&rsquo;s your favorite scene inEyes Wide Open?AG:Well, there are many, because the characters are based on people I know. But without doubt, one of the best involves my everyman hero, Jay Erlich, a doctor from Westchester who puts his successful life on hold and his life on the line to find the truth behind his nephew's suicide. Erlich goes to the super-max Pelican Bay Prison to see the long incarcerated Manson-like murderer, Russell Hovnanian. And the thing that makes that scene really creepy, and made hard to write, was that to be credible, this character, Hovnanian, had to be smarter than my hero, smarter than the very smart detective who accompanies him, even smarter than the reader! Oh yeah, the author too. But when it's pulled off, as I hope I did, it's a killer scene.LG:You wrote sixNew York Timesbestsellers with James Patterson. Dish. What was it like to work with Jim, and how much more fun is it to control everything yourself?AG:Such good questions. Are you a writer, too? Oh, wait.  Never mind.Ha! Jim and I got along fine; he's an amazing idea guy, his instincts for plot are finely honed, and I think he might even say himself that he's a sharper editor than a writer. I always describe working with him as an MFA and MBA course in thriller management rolled into one. I learned a lot of things about how to craft a thriller that would have taken years to learn on my own&mdash;and how to put them in my own style. I&rsquo;m honestly proud of the six books we did together, all of which went to number one. But yes, I&rsquo;m kind of a control guy&mdash;how did you know?To his credit, Jim let me have a substantial share of control on the books we did&mdash;probably a lot more than I would have. He&rsquo;s a much more evolved manager than me! And all these books later, I still kind of miss him, calling him up, running a plot idea by him. I mean, is there a better person in the world to bounce an idea off of? But I also like it when the checks are made out solely to me!LG:Now tell me the truth. What is your least favorite part of writing&mdash;and you can only choose one.AG:Easy&mdash;this is becoming a bit of a running theme here&mdash;loss of control! You shape your baby from the initial birth of an idea, live with it daily, watch it grow like a child into a fully dimensional being. You feel you know it better than anybody. Then you turn it over and put it out into the world and between the cover, the marketing, the presentation at retail and the sales, it all takes place without you being able to control its destiny a single lick! And by that time, you're already halfway into the next one anyway!LG:Finally, what do you want readers to take away from readingEyes Wide Open&mdash;and congrats on another great novel!AG:Thanks, Lisa. What I would have them take away is thatEyes Wide Openis not only a thrilling read, it's also an engrossing, emotional family story&mdash;about a family with a dark history and the lengths it will go to protect that secret. It&rsquo;s also about two brothers, one wayward, the other successful, and how they try to bridge the gap that tore them apart. It reads like a personal memoir chock-full of thrills. And it&rsquo;s my family story.So great to be with you today! I was a big fan ofLove You More. It&rsquo;s been a lot of fun!",
        "0062024035": "A Q&amp;A with Author Veronica RothQ:What advice would you offer to young aspiring writers, who long to live a success story like your own?Roth:One piece of advice I have is: Want something else more than success. Success is a lovely thing, but your desire to say something, your worth, and your identity shouldn&rsquo;t rely on it, because it&rsquo;s not guaranteed and it&rsquo;s not permanent and it&rsquo;s not sufficient. So work hard, fall in love with the writing&mdash;the characters, the story, the words, the themes&mdash;and make sure that you are who you are regardless of your life circumstances. That way, when the good things come, they don&rsquo;t warp you, and when the bad things hit you, you don&rsquo;t fall apart.Q:You&rsquo;re a young author--is it your current adult perspective or not-so-recent teenage perspective that brought about the factions in the development of this story? Do you think that teens or adults are more likely to fit into categories in our current society?Roth:Other aspects of my identity have more to do with the factions than my age. The faction system reflects my beliefs about human nature&mdash;that we can make even something as well-intentioned as virtue into an idol, or an evil thing. And that virtue as an end unto itself is worthless to us. I did spend a large portion of my adolescence trying to be as &ldquo;good&rdquo; as possible so that I could prove my worth to the people around me, to myself, to God, to everyone. It&rsquo;s only now that I&rsquo;m a little older that I realize I am unable to be truly &ldquo;good&rdquo; and that it&rsquo;s my reasons for striving after virtue that need adjustment more than my behavior. In a sense,Divergentis me writing through that realization&mdash;everyone in Beatrice&rsquo;s society believes that virtue is the end, the answer. I think that&rsquo;s a little twisted.I think we all secretly love and hate categories&mdash;love to get a firm hold on our identities, but hate to be confined&mdash;and I never loved and hated them more than when I was a teenager. That said: Though we hear a lot about high school cliques, I believe that adults categorize each other just as often, just in subtler ways. It is a dangerous tendency of ours. And it begins in adolescence.Q:If you could add one more faction to the world withinDivergent, what would it be?Roth:I tried to construct the factions so that they spanned a wide range of virtues. Abnegation, for example, includes five of the traditional &ldquo;seven heavenly virtues:&rdquo; chastity, temperance, charity, patience, and humility. That said, it would be interesting to have a faction centered on industriousness, in which diligence and hard work are valued most, and laziness is not allowed. They would be in constant motion, and would probably be happy to take over for the factionless. And hard-working people can certainly take their work too far, as all the factions do with their respective virtues. I&rsquo;m not sure what they would wear, though. Overalls, probably.Q:What do you think are the advantages, if any, to the society you&rsquo;ve created inDivergent?Roth:All the advantages I see only seem like advantages to me because I live in our current society. For example, the members of their society don&rsquo;t focus on certain things: race, religion, sexual orientation, political affiliation, etc. I mean, a world in which you look different from the majority and no one minds? That sounds good to me. But when I think about it more, I realize that they&rsquo;re doing the exact same thing we do, but with different criteria by which to distinguish ourselves from others. Instead of your skin color, it&rsquo;s the color of your shirt that people assess, or the results of your aptitude test. Same problem, different system.Q:What book are you currently reading and how has it changed you, if at all?Roth:I recently finishedImaginary Girlsby Nova Ren Suma, which I would call &ldquo;contemporary with a paranormal twist,&rdquo; or something to that effect. It&rsquo;s about a girl whose sister has a powerful kind of magnetism within the confines of a particular town, and how their love for each other breaks some things apart and puts other things back together. It was refreshing to read a young adult book that is about sisterhood instead of romance. It&rsquo;s one of those books that makes you love a character and then hate a character and then love them again&mdash;that shows you that people aren&rsquo;t all good or all bad, but somewhere in between.Imaginary Girlsgave me a lot to think about, and the writing was lovely, which I always love to see.--This text refers to theHardcoveredition.",

As a young child in California and, after her parents&#x2019; divorce, Nashville, she knew she had to write, and she was fortunate, as she so warmly and vividly explains, in her writing teachers&#x2014;Allan Gurganus, Grace Paley, and Russell Banks&#x2014;and in her success supporting herself by writing nonfiction for magazines and newspapers, beginning with Seventeen and extending to the New York Times Magazine, GQ, Vogue, and Gourmet. Patchett now assembles a retrospective set of 22 sterling personal essays to form an episodic, piquant, instructive, and entertaining self-portrait. She reflects on her family, life on a Tennessee farm, literary discipline and inspiration, and her failed first marriage.

While convalescing in England, Bess is tormented because she's put off delivering a message from Arthur Graham, a dying soldier under her care for whom she'd developed strong feelings, to his family. Her own brush with death prompts her to travel to Kent and transmit Arthur's cryptic last words to one of his three brothers. Bess becomes further enmeshed in the family's affairs after she learns the obscure message may relate to Graham's half-brother, Peregrine, who was committed to a local asylum for a girl's murder years before. The more Bess seeks to sate her curiosity, the more she suspects that the truth about the murder was suppressed.

        "0060930349": "Paul Johnson, whose previous works include the distinguishedModern TimesandA History of the Jews, has produced an epic that spans the history of the American people over the past 400 years. The prolific narrative covers every aspect of U.S. history, from science, customs, religion, and politics to the individual men and women who have helped shape the nation. His detailed, provocative examinations of political and social icons, from Lyndon Johnson to Norman Rockwell, are especially strong. Johnson's text is intelligent and rich with detail, and yet extremely accessible for anyone interested in a reinterpretive analysis of America's past.What makes this book unique is Johnson's approach to this self-professed Herculean task. The prevalent tone throughout is optimism. Whether he's discussing race relations, industrialization, the history of women, immigrants, Vietnam, or political correctness, Johnson--a staunch conservative who was born, bred, and educated in England--is openly enamored with America's past, particularly the hardships and tribulations that the nation has had to overcome. He sees this story as a series of important lessons, not just for Americans but for the whole of mankind as well. At a time when other contemporary scholars find it easier to bemoan the past, Johnson offers the reader &quot;a compelling antidote to those who regard the future with pessimism.&quot;--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",
        "0091795273": "An exhaustive, soul-searching memoir, Bill Clinton'sMy Lifeis a refreshingly candid look at the former president as a son, brother, teacher, father, husband, and public figure. Clinton painstakingly outlines the history behind his greatest successes and failures, including his dedication to educational and economic reform, his war against a \"vast right-wing operation\" determined to destroy him, and the \"morally indefensible\" acts for which he was nearly impeached.My Lifeis autobiography as therapy--a personal history written by a man trying to face and banish his private demons.Clinton approaches the story of his youth with gusto, sharing tales of giant watermelons, nine-pound tumors, a charging ram, famous mobsters and jazz musicians, and a BB gun standoff. He offers an equally energetic portrait of American history, pop culture, and the evolving political landscape, covering the historical events that shaped his early years (namely the deaths of Martin Luther King Jr. and JFK) and the events that shaped his presidency (Waco, Bosnia, Somalia). What makesMy Liferemarkable as a political memoir is how thoroughly it is infused with Clinton's unassuming, charmingly pithy voice:I learned a lot from the stories my uncle, aunts, and grandparents told me: that no one is perfect but most people are good; that people can't be judged only by their worst or weakest moments; that harsh judgments can make hypocrites of us all; that a lot of life is just showing up and hanging on; that laughter is often the best, and sometimes the only, response to pain.However, that same voice might tire readers as Clinton applies his penchant for minute details to a distractible laundry list of events, from his youth through the years of his presidency. Not wanting to forget a single detail that might help account for his actions, Clinton overdoes it--do we really need to know the name of his childhood barber? But when Clinton sticks to the meat of his story--recollections about Mother, his abusive stepfather, Hillary, the campaign trail, and Kenneth Starr--the veracity of emotion andKitchen Confidential-type revelations about \"what it is like to be President\" makeMy Lifeimpossible to put down.To Clinton, \"politics is a contact sport,\" and while he claims thatMy Lifeis not intended to make excuses or assign blame, it does portray him as a fighter whose strategy is to \"take the first hit, then counterpunch as hard as I could.\" WhileMy Lifeis primarily a stroll through Clinton's memories, it is also a scathing rebuke--a retaliation against his detractors, including Kenneth Starr, whose \"mindless search for scandal\" protected the guilty while \"persecuting the innocent\" and distracted his Administration from pressing international matters (including strikes on al Qaeda). Counterpunch indeed.At its core,My Lifeis a charming and intriguing if flawed book by an equally intriguing and flawed man who had his worst failures and humiliations made public. Ultimately, the man who left office in the shadow of scandal offers an honest and open account of his life, allowing readers to witness his struggle to \"drain the most out of every moment\" while maintaining the character with which he was raised. It is a remarkably intimate, persuasive look at the boy he was, the President he became, and man he is today.--Daphne Durham--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",
        "006039322X": "Director Hitchcock is in a class by himself. His legendary films, including Rear Window, The 39 Steps and Notorious, coupled with his TV show, Alfred Hitchock Presents, aired his singular brand of evil and salvation. In this enthralling, scholarly and candid appraisal of the artist, McGilligan, a biographer of James Cagney and Jack Nicholson, neatly reveals the man behind the camera. A quiet Catholic boy from London's East End, Hitchcock (1899- 1980) began as a production designer on silent films and eventually became Britain's premier movie director. David Selznick tapped him for Hollywood, and although their relationship was stormy, it spelled success. Hitchcock, who claimed, \"I'm not interested in logic, I'm interested in effect,\" quickly redefined the medium. He told his stories visually, invented innovative camera angles and reveled in suspense tales. Always, he was aided by his wife, Alma, an invaluable partner on every project. A Hitchcock film \"characteristically mingled light with darkness,\" possibly because its creator was so conflicted. Hitchcock adored gossip, dirty jokes and icy blondes, though, sexually impotent, he could not consummate his desire; his voyeurism instead played out on screen. He relished the occasional cruelty, but it did not obscure his genius or his generosity. He worked tirelessly for the British war effort, though America was committed to neutrality until Pearl Harbor, and was deeply loyal to old friends. McGilligan has crafted an inside look at this unique director and the studio machinations that sustained him. Film buffs will relish how power and creativity play out in Hollywood. The rest will learn how obsession can produce art. 32-page b&w; photo insert not seen by PW.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.",

        "0060192119": "Once you begin readingAs Nature Made Him, a mesmerizing story of a medical tragedy and its traumatic results, you absolutely won't want to put it down. Following a botched circumcision, a family is convinced to raise their infant son, Bruce, as a girl. They rename the child Brenda and spend the next 14 years trying to transform him into a her. Brenda's childhood reads as one filled with anxiety and loneliness, and her fear and confusion are present on nearly every page concerning her early childhood. Much of her pain is caused by Dr. Money, who is presented as a villainous medical man attempting to coerce an unwilling child to submit to numerous unpleasant treatments.Reading over interviews and reports of decisions made by this doctor, it's difficult to contain anger at the widespread results of his insistence that natural-born gender can be altered with little more than willpower and hormone treatments. The attempts of his parents, twin brother, and extended family to assist Brenda to be happily female are touching--the sense is overwhelmingly of a family wanting to do \"right\" while being terribly mislead as to what \"right\" is for her. As Brenda makes the decision to live life as a male (at age 14), she takes the name David and begins the process of reversing the effects of estrogen treatments. David's ultimately successful life--a solid marriage, honest and close family relationships, and his bravery in making his childhood public--bring an uplifting end to his story. Equally fascinating is the latest segment of the longtime nature/nurture controversy, and the interviews of various psychological researchers and practitioners form a larger framework around David's struggle to live as the gender he was meant to be.--Jill Lightner",

As one of the most horrific crimes in modern history, these atrocities, the trial and the subsequent conviction of Charles Manson and his followers caused a media sensation, spawning movies, documentaries and bestselling books, including the classicHelter Skelter. A defining moment in an era otherwise associated with radical peace, love and understanding, this incident is one that still resonates with millions today.Yet while this crime left an indelible mark on society&#8217;s consciousness, it was, first and foremost, a shattering personal tragedy for those closest to Sharon&#8212;the loving family left to cope with the emotional devastation of her loss. Now, after nearly forty years, their story is finally revealed.Compiled by close family friend Alisa Statman and Sharon&#8217;s niece Brie Tate,Restless Soulsdraws on a wealth of material including interviews with the Tates, personal letters, tape recordings, home movies, public interviews, private journals, and official documents to provide a powerful, poignant, and affecting four-decade, three-generation memoir of crime and punishment, anguish and hope, rage and love, that is both a chronicle of death and a celebration of life.Extending beyond all previous accounts,Restless Soulsis the most revealing, riveting, and emotionally raw account not just of these heinous murders, the hunt and capture of the killers and the behind-the-scenes drama of their trials, but of the torment victims families&#8217; endure for years in the wake of such senseless violence.Tate family members set the record straight, correcting media misinformation and delving well beyond the official storyline to provide information, much of it available for the first time.

Solid Snake, everyone's favorite mullet-sporting supersoldier, is  back, along with many other familiar faces and voices. While its predecessor was  lauded for telling a complex story, this sequel has even more fascinating twists  and turns. Also, likeMetal Gear Solid,MGS2takes console-game storytelling to an entirely new level with  stunning in-game movies, great graphics, and game mechanics that let you find  your own solutions to challenges. The game's twisting and at times bizarre plot  will undoubtedly keep some gamers perplexed.Konami has replaced the moronic enemies from the firstMGSwith more  cerebral and capable foes; this causes an even greater emphasis on stealth than  the original. The controls have been refined and Snake's repertoire of moves has  grown, significantly deepening the gameplay. This is, technically and  stylistically, one of the best-looking PS2 games on the market. The sound is  also topnotch, with a fabulous score and outstanding voice acting. What makes  this game such a standout, however, is how all of these sight, sound, and story  elements combine to immerse the player into an entertainment form somewhere  between movie and game. It will be years beforeMetal Gear Solid 2: Sons of  Libertyis surpassed. This is interactive entertainment at its finest.--Raymond M.

        "B00012BSJ4": "When people ask me what my favorite game of all time is, I always answer the same thing:Metroid. Sure,Super Metroidon SNES took the concept and made it better, andMetroid Fusionwas a fantastic follow-up on the Game Boy Advance, but when push comes to shove the original is where my vote will always go. Then there'sMetroid Prime&#8230;but that's 3D and a story for a different day. This game and this story are all about the glory of 2D gaming.So you can only begin to imagine my excitement when Nintendo's newestMetroidredo appeared on my desk. For those of you that may not know,Zero Missionis a special edition of sorts. It's the originalMetroidwith spruced-up graphics, streamlined level designs and gameplay, plus a whole new chapter.At it's core, it is most definitely the originalMetroid, but as you travel around the world you start to notice differences. Hallways are changed, statues lead you to the next objective, and abilities like Power Grip and Space Jump that never existed in the original iteration pop up in time.Nintendo has been very hush-hush about this title since its announcement, and after playing through the game myself, I must admit I'm a little reluctant to give away too much, but I can give you some interesting facts to whet your whistle. The biggest chunk of new content takes place after you beat Mother Brain (which was where the original ended). Not only is this new zone fairly large (I would say it's bigger than Norfair and Brinstar combined) it incorporates a number of story elements that help tie the whole series together (includingMetroid Prime).In total, the game is still rather short. I beat it in roughly six and a half hours, and I wandered around a lot. But the new content is spectacular, and fans of the series will absolutely adore this special edition. And if you have never experiencedMetroid, then you are in for a treat. My one rip on this title is the fact that the game now holds your hand a little too much, so the title loses some of the wonder and puzzle solving that I loved about the original. But don't let this one setback stop you from picking up one of the greatest titles in the history of gaming.Concept:Update a classic with new graphics and lots of bonus materialGraphics:Crisp 2D sprites jump off your SP or GBA PlayerSound:Fantastic from beginning to endPlayability:Metroid's control set-up is still one of the most simple, yet complex schemes ever created &#8211; brilliantEntertainment:Replaying the original with added content is an 8-bit gamers dream come trueReplay:ModerateRated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Andy McNamaraIssue:February 20042nd Opinion:Much like the extended editions of The Lord of the Rings movies, Nintendo has reworked the originalMetroidto feature bonus content that ties into Samus' continuing adventures. I can't even begin to tell you how amazing this new material is. Let's just say that you're in for a big surprise after the Mother Brain fight. A huge surprise! I don't want to ruin the game for you, but I will say that there's a stretch of the game that I played with my jaw on the floor. Better yet, all of the original content has been extensively overhauled. The shape of the terrain has been altered dramatically, and as you progress through this incredible adventure you'll spot subtle changes every step of the way. With the original NES game included as a bonus, you'll get the chance to compare and contrast. Nintendo took one of the best games of all time and made it better.

Digging into her friend's past, particularly through the reams of notes Goldy took during long-ago sessions of the support group Amour Anonymous, she discovers unsettling secrets involving Holly and other prominent members of Aspen Meadow society. It becomes clear that whatever tidbits Holly took with her to the grave may have provided a motive for murder.

Yet others came to me as I wandered through life. In this book I want to share with you a selection of these stories as well as experiences that have stayed with me over the years. Each one of them taught me something important about life and leadership.

Four scientists working for the New York&ndash;based Kingsley International Group have died or disappeared within 24 hours. Wolfish top boss Tanner Kingsley vows to find the perpetrator; meanwhile, stunning artist Diane Stevens, wife of a just-murdered KIG scientist, and supermodel Kelly Harris, whose husband has likewise been killed, find themselves under attack by mysterious strangers. Diane and Kelly form an uneasy alliance, though both spend most of their time ruminating on their wonderful (now dead) husbands: \"I want to feel you stroking my breast.... I want to imagine that I can hear your voice saying that I make the best paella in the world....\" The plot is straightforward: people are killed, women are in peril and an evil CEO (Tanner, gasp!) has a plot to take over the world. His technique involves controlling the weather, and in an intriguing short afterword, Sheldon explains the very real possibilities of just such a scenario. The on-the-lam ladies, Kelly and Diane, escape every assassination attempt with ridiculous ease, and other characters appear and disappear simply in order to get the author out of one plot pickle after another. Still, despite (or because of) Sheldon's blithe unconcern for logic and his just-add-water relationships, this is a breezily pleasing read.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0061236829": "Starred Review. At the beginning of Oates's 36th novel, Rebecca Schwart is mistaken by a seemingly harmless man for another woman, Hazel Jones, on a footpath in 1959 Chatauqua Falls, N.Y. Five hundred pages later, Rebecca will find out that the man who accosted her is a serial killer, and Oates will have exercised, in a manner very difficult to forget, two of her recurring themes: the provisionality of identity and the awful suddenness of male violence. There's plenty of backstory, told in retrospect. Rebecca's parents escape from the Nazis with their two sons in 1936; Rebecca is born in the boat crossing over. When Rebecca is 13, her father, Jacob, a sexton in Milburn, N.Y., kills her mother, Anna, and nearly kills Rebecca, before blowing his own head off. At the time of the footpath crossing, Rebecca is just weeks away from being beaten, almost to death, by her husband, Niles Tignor (a shady traveling beer salesman). She and son Niley flee; she takes the name of the woman for whom she has been recently mistaken and becomes Hazel Jones. Niley, a nine-year-old with a musical gift, becomes Zacharias, \"a name from the bible,\" Rebecca tells people. Rebecca's Hazel navigates American norms as a waitress, salesperson and finally common-law wife of the heir of the Gallagher media fortune, a man in whom she never confides her past. Oates is our finest novelistic tracker, following the traces of some character's flight from or toward some ultimate violence with forensic precision. There are allusions here to the mythic scouts of James Fenimore Cooper'sLeatherstocking Tales, who explored the same New York territory when it was primeval woods. Many of the passages are a lot like a blown-up photo of a bruise&mdash;ugly without seeming to have a point. Yet the traumatic pattern of the hunter and the hunted, unfolded in Rebecca/Hazel's lifelong escape, never cripples Hazel: she is liberated, made crafty, deepened by her ultimately successful flight. Like Theodore Dreiser, Oates wears out objections with her characters, drawn in an explosive vernacular. Everything in this book depends on Oates' ability to bring a woman before the reader who is deeply veiled&mdash;whose real name is unknown even to herself&mdash;and she does it with epic panache.(June)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0060838728": "In an unnamed South American country, a world-renowned soprano sings at a birthday party in honor of a visiting Japanese industrial titan. His hosts hope that Mr. Hosokawa can be persuaded to build a factory in their Third World backwater. Alas, in the opening sequence, just as the accompanist kisses the soprano, a ragtag band of 18 terrorists enters the vice-presidential mansion through the air conditioning ducts. Their quarry is the president, who has unfortunately stayed home to watch a favorite soap opera. And thus, from the beginning, things go awry.Among the hostages are not only Hosokawa and Roxane Coss, the American soprano, but an assortment of Russian, Italian, and French diplomatic types. Reuben Iglesias, the diminutive and gracious vice president, quickly gets sideways of the kidnappers, who have no interest in him whatsoever. Meanwhile, a Swiss Red Cross negotiator named Joachim Messner is roped into service while vacationing. He comes and goes, wrangling over terms and demands, and the days stretch into weeks, the weeks into months.With the omniscience of magic realism, Ann Patchett flits in and out of the hearts and psyches of hostage and terrorist alike, and in doing so reveals a profound, shared humanity. Her voice is suitably lyrical, melodic, full of warmth and compassion. Hearing opera sung live for the first time, a young priest reflects:Never had he thought, never once, that such a woman existed, one who stood so close to God that God's own voice poured from her. How far she must have gone inside herself to call up that voice. It was as if the voice came from the center part of the earth and by the sheer effort and diligence of her will she had pulled it up through the dirt and rock and through the floorboards of the house, up into her feet, where it pulled through her, reaching, lifting, warmed by her, and then out of the white lily of her throat and straight to God in heaven.Joined by no common language except music, the 58 international hostages and their captors forge unexpected bonds. Time stands still, priorities rearrange themselves. Ultimately, of course, something has to give, even in a novel so imbued with the rich imaginative potential of magic realism. But in a fractious world,Bel Cantoremains a gentle reminder of the transcendence of beauty and love.--Victoria Jenkins--This text refers to theHardcoveredition.",
        "0020519001": "As a youth of 18, Ernest Hemingway was eager to fight in the Great War. Poor vision kept him out of the army, so he joined the ambulance corps instead and was sent to France. Then he transferred to Italy where he became the first American wounded in that country during World War I. Hemingway came out of the European battlefields with a medal for valor and a wealth of experience that he would, 10 years later, spin into literary gold withA Farewell to Arms. This is the story of Lieutenant Henry, an American, and Catherine Barkley, a British nurse. The two meet in Italy, and almost immediately Hemingway sets up the central tension of the novel: the tenuous nature of love in a time of war. During their first encounter, Catherine tells Henry about her fianc&eacute; of eight years who had been killed the year before in the Somme. Explaining why she hadn't married him, she says she was afraid marriage would be bad for him, then admits:I wanted to do something for him. You see, I didn't care about the other thing and he could have had it all. He could have had anything he wanted if I would have known. I would have married him or anything. I know all about it now. But then he wanted to go to war and I didn't know.The two begin an affair, with Henry quite convinced that he \"did not love Catherine Barkley nor had any idea of loving her. This was a game, like bridge, in which you said things instead of playing cards.\" Soon enough, however, the game turns serious for both of them and ultimately Henry ends up deserting to be with Catherine.Hemingway was not known for either unbridled optimism or happy endings, andA Farewell to Arms, like his other novels (For Whom the Bell Tolls,The Sun Also Rises, andTo Have and Have Not), offers neither. What itdoesprovide is an unblinking portrayal of men and women behaving with grace under pressure, both physical and psychological, and somehow finding the courage to go on in the face of certain loss.--Alix Wilber--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

        "0007491263": "*Starred Review* Sporting an enthusiastic introduction by George R. R. Martin (in which he calls the book &#x201C;the original game of thrones&#x201D;), this is the first U.S. publication of the first volume of French novelist Druon&#x2019;s seven-volume historical saga, collectively known as The Accursed Kings. Originally published in 1955, the novel is set in the year 1314. Philip IV, the king of France, has disbanded the Knights Templar, arresting, torturing, and executing most of them. Relations between France and England are as strained as they have ever been. Philip&#x2019;s increasingly desperate search for money to pay his massive debts has virtually bankrupted the country. Against this sprawling backdrop, Druon tells the story of Robert of Artois, a French lord whose lands have been taken from him by his greedy aunt and whose efforts to reclaim his birthright will lead to all-out war between France and England. Unlike Martin&#x2019;s multivolume Song of Fire and Ice, Druon&#x2019;s saga is based on real history and features real people as its central characters. It&#x2019;s historical fiction on a grand scale, full of political intrigue, family drama, and characters who, while drawn from life, are larger than it. Fans of historical epics who have not yet discovered Druon&#x2019;s saga will be thrilled with this one. --David Pitt",

The story is pretty grim: Teenaged Wolff moves with his divorced mother from Florida to Utah to Washington State to escape her violent boyfriend. When she remarries, Wolff finds himself in a bitter battle of wills with his abusive stepfather, a contest in which the two prove to be more evenly matched than might have been supposed. Deception, disguise, and illusion are the weapons the young man learns to employ as he grows up--not bad training for a writer-to-be.

        "0060735457": "Reading a Christopher Moore novel is a little like eating a potato chip--it's hard to stop at just one. And you don't have to look beyond the titles to understand the allure; who could pass up a book calledPractical DemonkeepingorIsland of the Sequined Love Nun? Each of Moore's tales skewers a particular literary genre. InCoyote Bluehe nailed New Age fascination with Native American religion; inBlood-Sucking Fiends: A Love Storyhe put a new twist on the classic vampire tale.The Lust Lizard of Melancholy Coveis a companion piece to his first novel, the hilariously twisted horror storyPractical Demonkeeping, and readers of that book will recognize the setting, Pine Cove, California. In addition, Moore includes plenty of his patented weird sex, occasional gross-out death, several off-kilter but nonetheless affecting love stories, and some fabulous secondary characters such as Mavis Sand:Mavis first began augmenting her parts in the fifties, first out of vanity: breasts, eyelashes, hair. Later, as she aged and the concept of maintenance eluded her, she began having parts replaced as they failed, until almost half of her body weight was composed of stainless steel (hips, elbows, shoulders, finger joints, rods fused to vertebrae five through twelve), silicon wafers (hearing aids, pacemaker, insulin pump), advanced polymer resins (cataract replacement lenses, dentures), Kevlar fabric (abdominal wall reinforcement), titanium (knees, ankles), and pork (ventricular heart valve).In a nutshell, the plot revolves around a gigantic prehistoric lizard whose slumber deep beneath the ocean surface is interrupted by a radioactive leak from a nearby power plant. At the same time, a woman in Pine Cove hangs herself; the local psychiatrist (who has been prescribing antidepressants to everyone in town with gay abandon) decides the suicide was her fault and yanks everyone's medication; and an elderly black blues singer named Catfish Jefferson arrives to perform at the Head of the Slug saloon.  Into this already strange brew mix one schizoid former B-movie starlet, a pot-head town constable, a bereaved local artist, a biologist tracking anomalous behavior in rats, a crooked sheriff, and a pharmacist with a bizarre sexual fixation on sea mammals, and you have a recipe for the kind of madness Moore does so well.--Alix Wilber--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

Unique and invaluable to her &#x201C;pride,&#x201D; the 16-year-old is kept on a short leash, and it has already been ordained that she will mate with the alpha male, Cassian. Jacinda's determination to do things her own way finds her nearly captured by dragon hunters, but a surprisingly kind young hunter named Will allows her to escape. Rather than suffer the pride's punishment for her daughter's risky behavior, Jacinda's mother decides the family should flee to live among regular humans. Masquerading as a typical high school student would bury Jacinda's draki nature until it died out. When Will turns out to be a classmate, Jacinda finds that her inexplicable attraction to him keeps her feel of fire and flight alive.

        "0099460297": "The artful construction of this seductive novel and the mature, compassionate wisdom permeating it would be impressive for a seasoned writer, but it's all the more remarkable in a debut. This narrative of the McLeod family during three vital summers is rich with implications about the bonds and stresses of kin and friendship, the ache of loneliness and the cautious tendrils of renewal blossoming in unexpected ways. Glass depicts the mysterious twists of fate and cosmic (but unobtrusive) coincidences that bring people together, and the self-doubts and lack of communication that can keep them apart, in three fluidly connected sections in which characters interact over a decade. These people are entirely at home in their beautifully detailed settings Greece, rural Scotland, Greenwich Village and the Hamptons and are fully dimensional in their moments of both frailty and grace. Paul McLeod, the reticent Scots widower introduced in the first section, is the father of Fenno, the central character of the middle section, who is a reserved, self-protective gay bookstore owner in Manhattan; both have dealings with the third section's searching young artist, Fern Olitsky, whose guilt in the wake of her husband's death leaves her longing for and fearful of beginning anew. Other characters are memorably individualistic: an acerbic music critic dying of AIDS, Fenno's emotionally elusive mother, his sibling twins and their wives, and his insouciant lover among them. In this dazzling portrait of family life, Glass establishes her literary credentials with ingenuity and panache.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

Although George has already lived in the camp long enough to father an illegitimate child, Serena is new to the mountains--but she soon shows herself to be the equal of any man, overseeing crews, hunting rattle-snakes, even saving her husband's life in the wilderness. Together this lord and lady of the woodlands ruthlessly kill or vanquish all who fall out of favor. Yet when Serena learns that she will never bear a child, she sets out to murder the son George fathered without her. Mother and child begin a struggle for their lives, and when Serena suspects George is protecting his illegitimate family, the Pembertons' intense, passionate marriage starts to unravel as the story moves toward its shocking reckoning.Rash's masterful balance of violence and beauty yields a riveting novel that, at its core, tells of love both honored and betrayed.The Gift of Silence: An Essay by Ron RashWhen readers ask how I came to be a writer, I usually mention several influences: my parents&#x2019; teaching by example the importance of reading; a grandfather who, though illiterate, was a wonderful storyteller; and, as I grew older, an awareness that my region had produced an inordinate number of excellent writers and that I might find a place in that tradition.  Nevertheless, I believe what most made me a writer was my early difficulty with language.My mother tells me that certain words were impossible for me to pronounce, especially those with j&#x2019;s and g&#x2019;s.  Those hard consonants were like tripwires in my mouth, causing me to stumble over words such as &#x201C;jungle&#x201D; and &#x201C;generous.&#x201D;  My parents hoped I would grow out of this problem, but by the time I was five, I&#x2019;d made no improvement.  There was no speech therapist in the county, but one did drive in from the closest city once a week.That once a week was a Saturday morning at the local high school.  For an hour the therapist worked with me.  I don&#x2019;t remember much of what we did in those sessions, except that several times she held my hands to her face as she pronounced a word.  I do remember how large and empty the classroom seemed with just the two of us in it, and how small I felt sitting in a desk made for teenagers.I improved, enough so that by summer&#x2019;s end the therapist said I needed no further sessions.  I still had trouble with certain words (one that bedevils me even today is &#x201C;gesture&#x201D;), but not enough that when I entered first grade my classmates and teacher appeared to notice.  Nevertheless, certain habits of silence had taken hold.  It was not just self-consciousness.  Even before my sessions with the speech therapist, I had convinced myself that if I listened attentively enough to others my own tongue would be able to mimic their words.  So I listened more than I spoke.  I became comfortable with silence, and, not surprisingly, spent a lot of time alone wandering nearby woods and creeks.  I entertained myself with stories I made up, transporting myself into different places, different selves.  I was in training to be a writer, though of course at that time I had yet to write more than my name.Yet my most vivid memory of that summer is not the Saturday morning sessions at the high school but one night at my grandmother&#x2019;s farmhouse. After dinner, my parents, grandmother and several other older relatives gathered on the front porch.  I sat on the steps as the night slowly enveloped us, listening intently as their tongues set free words I could not master.  Then it appeared. A bright-green moth big as an adult&#x2019;s hand fluttered over my head and onto the porch, drawn by the light filtering through the screen door.  The grown-ups quit talking as it brushed against the screen, circled overhead, and disappeared back into the night.  It was a luna moth, I learned later, but in my mind that night it became indelibly connected to the way I viewed language--something magical that I grasped at but that was just out of reach.In first grade, I began learning that loops and lines made from lead and ink could be as communicative as sound. Now, almost five decades later, language, spoken or written, is no longer out of reach, but it remains just as magical as that bright-green moth.  What writer would wish it otherwise.",

And even though such organisms would not likely be able to harm humans, the possibility exists that first contact might be our last.That's the scientific supposition that Michael Crichton formulates and follows out to its conclusion in his excellent debut novel,The Andromeda Strain.A Nobel-Prize-winning bacteriologist, Jeremy Stone, urges the president to approve an extraterrestrial decontamination facility to sterilize returning astronauts, satellites, and spacecraft that might carry an \"unknown biologic agent.\" The government agrees, almost too quickly, to build the top-secret Wildfire Lab in the desert of Nevada. Shortly thereafter, unbeknownst to Stone, the U.S. Army initiates the \"Scoop\" satellite program, an attempt to actively collect space pathogens for use in biological warfare. When Scoop VII crashes a couple years later in the isolated Arizona town of Piedmont, the Army ends up getting more than it asked for.The Andromeda Strainfollows Stone and rest of the scientific team mobilized to react to the Scoop crash as they scramble to understand and contain a strange and deadly outbreak.

The resulting society is a feminist's nightmare: women are strictly controlled, unable to have jobs or money and assigned to various classes: the chaste, childless Wives; the housekeeping Marthas; and the reproductive Handmaids, who turn their offspring over to the \"morally fit\" Wives.

        "0099451743": "What (in Range of Motion) seemed an unerring touch for the emotional truths of women's lives proves imperfect after all for Berg, who misses the mark in this story of a wife and mother who runs away to find herself. In a plot device reminiscent of Ann Tyler's Ladder of Years, Berg's protagonist, Nan, impulsively leaves her Massachusetts home soon after she turns 50, hitting the road to find a new sense of direction. \"I have felt so long like I am drowning,\" she explains in a letter to her husband, Martin, as she begins a car trip westward with no destination in mind except to \"come into my own.\" She chronicles both the geographical terrain and her inner landscape in further letters to Martin and to her grown daughter, Ruthie, and in a journal that has the tone of an adolescent's diary. Women will empathize with Nan's fear of aging and her gradual realization of the resentment she has long felt about filling the role of dutiful wife, but the epistolary device strips the story of immediacy, and the situations Nan describes are often unlikely or merely tame (she has a noisy tantrum at a beauty salon when she decides not to dye her gray hair; she invites a stranger into her cabin in the Minnesota woods and, when they go to bed, they just cuddle). Nan's conversations with other women are overdosed with saccharine, and her epiphanies are old hat. Self-indulgent and cloying, this is a one-tone narrative with almost none of the dramatic resonance Berg's fans have learned to expect.Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

        "0060513608": "The events of September 11 have seemingly been covered, analyzed, and discussed from every angle imaginable. So the subject matter alone of Jim DeFede'sThe Day the World Came to Townmakes it noteworthy. In the immediate aftermath of the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, 38 commercial airliners carrying over 6,000 passengers were forced, as a precautionary measure, to land in Gander, Newfoundland, Canada. Due to the ongoing closure of U.S. airspace, the passengers spent four days in this isolated town of 10,000 before being allowed to continue on their way. In that time, Gander's residents rallied together to extend a kind of hospitality that seems too expansive for the wordhospitality. Townspeople not only opened schools and legion halls for use as emergency shelters, they invited the passengers into their homes for showers, meals, and warm beds while local businesses simply gave toiletries and clothing to passengers stuck without luggage. Despite the grim consequences that led to the situation, DeFede finds humor: two flight attendants are offered a car for sightseeing by a local woman who happened to be driving by; the stranded chairman of Hugo Boss finds himself shopping for men's underwear at the local Wal-Mart. But the real message of the book is how, even in times of great turmoil and conflict, people can and must look to one another for comfort, help, and hope.--John Moe",
        "0060987103": "With a husky voice and a gentle, dramatic manner that will call to mind the image of a patient grandfather reading to an excited gaggle of children, McDonough leisurely narrates this fantastical tale of good and evil, of choice and responsibility. In Maguire's Oz, Elphaba, better known as the Wicked Witch of the West, is not wicked; nor is she a formally schooled witch. Instead, she's an insecure, unfortunately green Munchkinlander who's willing to take radical steps to unseat the tyrannical Wizard of Oz. Using an appropriately brusque voice for the always blunt Elphaba, McDonough relates her tumultuous childhood (spent with an alcoholic mother and a minister father) and eye-opening school years (when she befriends her roommate, Glinda). McDonough's pacing remains frustratingly slow even after the plot picks up, and Elphaba's protracted ruminations on the nature of evil will have some listeners longing for an abridgement. Still, McDonough's excellent portrayals of Elphaba's outspoken, gravel-voiced nanny, Glinda's snobbish friends and the wide-eyed, soft-spoken Dorothy make this excursion to Oz worthwhile.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Constable Barbara Havers face their most challenging and perilous case yet&mdash;the linked murders of four youths, three of black or mixed parentage&mdash;in bestseller George's absorbing 13th British police procedural (after 2003'sA Place of Hiding). Crime fans will find plenty of forensic minutiae and details of police bureaucracy and politics, but it's characterization at which George really excels. The up-and-down career of Havers is at low ebb following her demotion from sergeant to constable, and her rocky personal life doesn't make that easier to bear. Lynley's professional life has become more difficult due to the continued absence of Supt. Malcolm Webberly and the need to deal directly with Asst. Commissioner David Hillier.

        "0060563079": "\"All children, except one, grow up.\" Thus begins a great classic of children's literature that we all remember as magical. What we tend to forget, because the tale of Peter Pan and Neverland has been so relentlessly boiled down, hashed up, and coated in saccharine, is that J.M. Barrie's original version is also witty, sophisticated, and delightfully odd. The Darling children, Wendy, John, and Michael, live a very proper middle-class life in Edwardian London, but they also happen to have a Newfoundland for a nurse. The text is full of such throwaway gems as \"Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter Pan when she was tidying up her children's minds,\" and is peppered with deliberately obscure vocabulary including \"embonpoint,\" \"quietus,\" and \"pluperfect.\" Lest we forget, it was written in 1904, a relatively innocent age in which a plot about abducted children must have seemed more safely fanciful. Also, perhaps, it was an age that expected more of its children's books, forPeter Panhas a suppleness, lightness, and intelligence that are \"literary\" in the best sense. In a typical exchange with the dastardly Captain Hook, Peter Pan describes himself as \"youth... joy... a little bird that has broken out of the egg,\" and the author interjects: \"This, of course, was nonsense; but it was proof to the unhappy Hook that Peter did not know in the least who or what he was, which is the very pinnacle of good form.\" A book for adult readers-aloud to revel in--and it just might teach young listeners to fly.

        "0062023020": "This fantasy-romance debut features faerie king Rain Tairen Soul, a man tormented by age-old grief: a thousand years ago, the woman he loved was slain in battle, and in his rage he laid waste to half the world. Now his people are dying out and the evil mages of Eld are rising again. When Rain hears the call of his lost soul mate, Ellysetta, he journeys to the neighboring kingdom to find her; when he claims a woodcarver's daughter as his mate, he scandalizes the nobility of her country and rouses the interest of Eld's wicked wizards, who come seeking her in order to get at Rain. The first book in a series, much of this volume is devoted to establishing the characters and their world, at the expense of plot. Though the extended courtship between Rain and Ellysetta can grow tedious, the story moves well enough to hold readers' interest and draw them into the sequel (due in November), which should advance the plot significantly. A promising start, this series should have great appeal for fans of fantasy and will likely reward romance readers for whom patience is not a problem.(Oct.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Such is the case with Steve Dublanica, a seminary dropout and laid-off psychiatric worker who, in 2004, started www.WaiterRant.net, blogging as The Waiter. His brutal observations on waiting tables at an upscale restaurant he called The Bistro (outed as Lanterna Tuscan Bistro in Nyack, N.Y.) are expanded in this entertaining audio. Dan John Miller is pitch perfect not only as the Waiter&mdash;who devolves from woebegone rookie into jaded veteran&mdash;but also as his customers, co-workers, bosses and brother. Miller's vocal interpretation dovetails seamlessly with the material. He shines when the Waiter is dishing it out, but even more so when he's taking it. Miller's performance is enthralling during passages in which he reveals his crippling self-doubt, overwhelming sense of underachievement and acknowledgment that he's become somewhat of a jerk.An Ecco hardcover (Reviews, Apr. 28).

        "0007410956": "Amazon Best Books of the Month, May 2011:  Near the end of World War II, a plane carrying 24 members of the United States military, including nine Women&#x2019;s Army Corps (WAC) members, crashed into the New Guinea jungle during a sightseeing excursion. 21 men and women were killed. The three survivors--a beautiful WAC, a young lieutenant who lost his twin brother in the crash, and a severely injured sergeant--were stranded deep in a jungle valley notorious for its cannibalistic tribes. They had no food, little water, and no way to contact their military base. The story of their survival and the stunning efforts undertaken to save them are the crux ofLost in Shangri-La, Mitchell Zuckoff&#x2019;s remarkable and inspiring narrative. Faced with the potential brutality of the Dani tribe, known throughout the valley for its violence, the trio&#x2019;s lives were dependent on an unprecedented rescue mission--a dedicated group of paratroopers jumped into the jungle to provide aid and medical care, consequently leaving the survivors and paratroopers alike trapped on the jungle floor. A perilous rescue by plane became their only possible route to freedom. A riveting story of deliverance under the most unlikely circumstances,Lost in Shangri-Ladeserves its place among the great survival stories of World War II.--Lynette MongAmazon Exclusive: Hampton Sides ReviewsLost in Shangri-LaHampton Sidesis the editor-at-large forOutsidemagazine and the author of the international bestsellerGhost Soldiers, which won the 2002 PEN USA Award for nonfiction and the 2002 Discover Award from Barnes &amp; Noble, and also served as the basis for the 2005 Miramax filmThe Great Raid.Although World War II was the greatest conflict in the history of this planet, many a jaded reader has come to the reluctant conclusion that there aren&rsquo;t any more World War II stories left to tell. At least not good ones&mdash;not tales of the &ldquo;ripping good yarn&rdquo; variety. Yet remarkably, in his new bookLost in Shangri-La, Mitchell Zuckoff has found one, and he&rsquo;s told it with reportorial verve, narrative skill, and exquisite pacing.What makes this World War II story all the more fascinating is that it isn&rsquo;t really a war story&mdash;not in a strict military sense. It&rsquo;s more of an exotic adventure tale with rich anthropological shadings. In 1945, near the end of the war, an American plane crashes in a hidden jungle valley in New Guinea inhabited by Stone Age cannibals. 21 Americans die in the crash, but three injured survivors soon find themselves stumbling through the jungle without food, nursing terrible wounds and trying to elude Japanese snipers known to be holding out in the mountains.The first contact between the three Americans and the valley&rsquo;s Dani tribesmen is both poignant and comical. The Americans, Zuckoff writes, have &ldquo;crash-landed in a world that time didn&rsquo;t forget. Time never knew it existed.&rdquo; The tribesmen, who have never encountered metal and have yet to master the concept of the wheel, think the American interlopers are white spirits who&rsquo;ve descended on a vine from heaven, fulfilling an ancient legend. They&rsquo;re puzzled and fascinated by the layers of &ldquo;removable skin&rdquo; in which these alien visitors are wrapped; the natives, who smear their bodies in pig grease and cover their genitals with gourds, have never seen clothes before.The Americans, in turn, are pretty sure their boartusk-bestudded hosts want to skewer them for dinner.What ensues in Zuckoff&rsquo;s fine telling is not so much a cultural collision as a pleasing and sometimes hilarious mutual unraveling of assumptions. Though the differences in the two societies are chasmic, the Americans and the Dani become&mdash;in a guarded, tentative sort of way&mdash;friends.But when armed American airmen arrive via parachute to rescue the survivors, relations become more tense. The Americans make their camp right in the middle of a no-man&rsquo;s land between warring Dani tribes&mdash;a no-man&rsquo;s land where for centuries they have fought the battles that are central to their daily culture. Here, Zuckoff notes, the ironies are profoundly rich. The Dani, untouched by and indeed utterly unaware of the great war that&rsquo;s been raging all across the globe, become thoroughly discombobulated when their own war is temporarily disrupted.Yes, therearestill a few good World War II stories left to tell. And yes, this one meets all the requirements of a ripping good yarn. Zuckoff, who teaches journalism at Boston University, is a first-rate reporter who has spared no expense to rescue this tale from obscurity. His story has it all: Tragedy, survival, comedy, an incredibly dangerous eleventh-hour rescue, and an immensely attractive heroine to boot. It&rsquo;s extraordinary that Hollywood hasn&rsquo;t already taken this tale and run wild with it. If it did, the resulting movie would be equal partsAlive,Cast Away, andThe Gods Must Be Crazy. It&rsquo;s as though the Americans have arrived in the Stone Age through a wormhole in the space-time continuum. The Dani don&rsquo;t know what to do with themselves&mdash;and life, as any of us know it, will never be the same.--This text refers to theHardcoveredition.",

Those who carve out their lives in the wilderness will fight to the death to protect the water on which they've staked their claim. Lynn and her mother are good shots, picking off stray travelers who are tempted by their pond. Cholera outbreaks throughout the world mean that even when water is available, it could be deadly, and the 16-year-old and her mother spend their days purifying the pond water, hunting for food, persuading meager crops to grow, and standing sentry on their roof to guard against strangers. After her mother is killed by coyotes, Lynn tries to be self-reliant, but she knows that in time the men from a nearby settlement will attempt to seize her land. When her taciturn neighbor Stebbs offers help, she slowly opens herself to his friendship, and her lifelong solitude is further fractured when she meets a family that is trying to survive on the banks of a nearby stream. Lynn grows attached to the little girl and takes her into her home when Lucy's mother, who is starving and in labor, is unable to care for her. Lynn finds herself drawn to Lucy's uncle, who is about her own age. Things come to a head when Lucy becomes deathly ill and the band of men from the nearby settlement attack Lynn's house. An overreliance on expository dialogue leads to clumsy and unnatural-sounding exchanges. The story might appeal to teens who can't get enough of dystopian survival stories, but in a crowded field, this one offers nothing new.&#x2013;Kim Dare, Fairfax County Public Schools, VA&#x3B1;(c) Copyright 2013.

It is also the story of  Hedge, a mysterious necromancer who is digging up a monstrous evil that could  utterly destroy the Old Kingdom.

In the first book,Red Dragon(filmed asManhunter), Hannibal diabolically helps the FBI track a fascinating serial killer. (Takes one to know one.) InThe Silence of the Lambs, he advises fledgling FBI manhunter Clarice Starling, then makes a bloody, brilliant escape.Years later, posing as scholarly Dr. Fell, curator of a grand family's palazzo, Hannibal lives the good life in Florence, playing lovely tunes by serial killer/composer Henry VIII and killing hardly anyone himself. Clarice is unluckier: in the novel's action-film-like opening scene, she survives an FBI shootout gone wrong, and her nemesis, Paul Krendler, makes her the fall guy. Clarice is suspended, so, unfortunately, the first cop who stumbles on Hannibal is an Italian named Pazzi, who takes after his ancestors, greedy betrayers depicted in Dante'sInferno.Pazzi is on the take from a character as scary as Hannibal: Mason Verger. When Verger was a young man busted for raping children, his vast wealth saved him from jail. All he needed was psychotherapy--with Dr. Lecter. Thanks to the treatment, Verger is now on a respirator, paralyzed except for one crablike hand, watching his enormous, brutal moray eel swim figure eights and devour fish. His obsession is to feed Lecter to some other brutal pets.What happens when the Italian cop gets alone with Hannibal? How does Clarice's reunion with Lecter go from macabre to worse? Suffice it to say that the plot is Harris's weirdest, but it still has his signature mastery of realistic detail. There are flaws: Hannibal's madness gets a motive, which is creepy but lessens his mystery. If you want an exact duplicate ofThe Silence of the Lambs's Clarice/Hannibal duel, you'll miss what's cool about this book--that Hannibal is actually upstaged at points by other monsters. And if you think it's all unprecedentedly horrible, you're right. But note that the horrors are described with exquisite taste.

There, he developed a virulent opportunistic infection and died just one week later. Suddenly and unexpectedly alone, Oates staggered through her days and nights trying desperately just to survive Smith's death and the terrifying loneliness that his death brought. In her typically probing fashion, Oates navigates her way through the choppy waters of widowhood, at first refusing to accept her new identity as a widow. She wonders if there is a perspective from which the widow's grief is sheer vanity, this pretense that one's loss is so very special that there has never been a loss quite like it. In the end, Oates finds meaning, much like many of Tolstoy's characters, in the small acts that make up and sustain ordinary life. When she finds an earring she thought she'd lost in a garbage can that raccoons have overturned, she reflects, \"If I have lost the meaning of my life, and the love of my life, I might still find small treasured things amid the spilled and pilfered trash.\" At times overly self-conscious, Oates nevertheless shines a bright light in every corner in her soul-searing memoir of widowhood.

        "0099451956": "Caldwell and Thomason's intriguing intellectual suspense novel stars four brainy roommates at Princeton, two of whom have links to a mysterious 15th-century manuscript, theHypnerotomachia Poliphili. This rare text (a real book) contains embedded codes revealing the location of a buried Roman treasure. Comparisons toThe Da Vinci Codeare inevitable, but Caldwell and Thomason's book is the more cerebral-and better written-of the two: think Dan Brown by way of Donna Tartt and Umberto Eco. The four seniors are Tom Sullivan, Paul Harris, Charlie Freeman and Gil Rankin. Tom, the narrator, is the son of a Renaissance scholar who spent his life studying the ancient book, \"an encyclopedia masquerading as a novel, a dissertation on everything from architecture to zoology.\" The manuscript is also an endless source of fascination for Paul, who sees it as \"a siren, a fetching song on a distant shore, all claws and clutches in person. You court her at your risk.\" This debut novel's range of topics almost rivals theHypnerotomachia's itself, including etymology, Renaissance art and architecture, Princeton eating clubs, friendship, steganography (riddles) and self-interpreting manuscripts. It's a complicated, intricate and sometimes difficult read, but that's the point and the pleasure. There are murders, romances, dangers and detection, and by the end the heroes are in a race not only to solve the puzzle, but also to stay alive. Readers might be tempted to buy their own copy of theHypnerotomachiaand have a go at the puzzle. After all, Caldwell and Thomason have done most of the heavy deciphering-all that's left is to solve the final riddle, head for Rome and start digging.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "006087600X": "The diaries our 40th president kept while in office&mdash;edited and abridged by historian Brinkley (The Great Deluge)&mdash;are largely a straightforward political chronicle. Reagan describes meetings with heads of state and antiabortion leaders, reflects on legislative strategy and worries about leaks to the press. He often used his diary to vigorously defend his polices: for example, after a 1984 visit with South African archbishop Desmond Tutu (whom Reagan calls \"na&iuml;ve\"), the president explained why his approach to apartheid&mdash;\"quiet diplomacy\"&mdash;was preferable to sanctions. Reagan sometimes seems uncomfortable with dissent, as when he is irked by a high school student who presents a petition advocating a nuclear freeze. And he often sees the media as a \"lynch mob,\" trying to drum up scandal where there is none. Reagan's geniality shines through in his more quotidian comments: he muses regularly about how much he appreciates Nancy, and his complaints about hating Monday mornings make him seem quite like everyone else. Brinkley doesn't weigh down the text with extensive annotation; this makes for smooth reading, but those who don't remember the major political events of the 1980s will want to refer to the glossary of names. Reagan's diaries are revealing, and Brinkley has done historians and the broad public a great service by editing them for publication.(May 22)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0064410161": "Picking up from the final pages of thePentultimate Peril, this farewell installment to the ridiculously (and deservedly!) popularA Series of Unfortunate Eventsplaces our protagonists right where we last left them: on a large, wooden boat in the middle of the ocean, trapped with their nemesis Count Olaf, who has armed himself with a helmet-full of deadly Medusoid Mycelium.The situation quickly and--this being the Baudelaires--predictably deteriorates. Violet, Klaus, and Sunny find themselves tossed in a storm so terrible that our beloved narrator spends four pages describing how he cannot describe it. From this point on, fans of the series' smarty-pants wordplay and acrobatic narrative can rest assured that they're in for more of the same (and how) in this 368-page finale, and Daniel Handler's deadpan Snicket continues to tutor a generation in self-referential humor (including one particularly funny bit regarding three very short men carrying a large, flat piece of wood, painted to look like a living room). Snicket notes, of course, that if you read the entire series, \"your only reward will be 170 chapters of misery in your library and countless tears in your eyes.\"There's one big question, though, for anyone who's made it through \"the thirteenth chapter of the thirteenth volume in this sad history\": is the final book a fitting end? That question is probably best-answered by one ofThe End's most oft-repeated phrases: It depends on how you look at it. Those looking for conclusive resolution to the series' many, many mysteries may be disappointed, although some big questions do get explicit answers. Not surprisingly for a work so deliberately labyrinthine, though, even the absence of an answer can be sort of an answer--and reaction toThe Endcan be something of a Rorschach test for readers. Or, as Lemony Snicket says, \"Perhaps you don&#x92;t know yet what the end really means.\"--Paul Hughes",

Sijie's unnamed 17-year-old protagonist and his best friend, Luo, are bourgeois doctors' sons, and so condemned to serve four years in a remote mountain village, carrying pails of excrement daily up a hill. Only their ingenuity helps them to survive. The two friends are good at storytelling, and the village headman commands them to put on \"oral cinema shows\" for the villagers, reciting the plots and dialogue of movies. When another city boy leaves the mountains, the friends steal a suitcase full of forbidden books he has been hiding, knowing he will be afraid to call the authorities. Enchanted by the prose of a host of European writers, they dare to tell the story of The Count of Monte Cristo to the village tailor and to read Balzac to his shy and beautiful young daughter. Luo, who adores the Little Seamstress, dreams of transforming her from a simple country girl into a sophisticated lover with his foreign tales. He succeeds beyond his expectations, but the result is not what he might have hoped for, and leads to an unexpected, droll and poignant conclusion. The warmth and humor of Sijie's prose and the clarity of Rilke's translation distinguish this slim first novel, a wonderfully human tale. (Sept. 17)Forecast: Sijie's debut was a best-seller and prize winner in France in 2000, and rights have been sold in 19 countries; it is also scheduled to be made into a film. Its charm translates admirably strong sales can be expected on this side of the Atlantic.Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

The family is left with a difficult decision when they learn Elle is pregnant. Should she be taken off life support, as her past comments and certain documents seem to suggest, or should she be kept alive to bring the baby to full-term?

        "B000067DPM": "Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship",

She is given several destinations, four rules, and the instruction to open one envelope upon her arrival at each place. Thus begins a rapid tour of Europe as the teen struggles to accomplish the tasks established by her aunt. The motivation: Ginny wants to understand the woman's wanderlust and, possibly, she just wants a connection to her beloved relative. Throughout her adventures in Rome, Paris, Greece, England, and the Netherlands, the teen collects pieces of Peg's past and learns more about her rapid departure. She also learns much about herself. The reason Ginny is sent to meet certain people is not always clear; sometimes she (and readers) wonder about the point of the exercise.

He can't get along in his elementary school classroom because of his mood swings and his \"dud meds.\" We gradually see that Joey must have Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD), which is not being effectively controlled with his current medication. Joey's life is a terrifying roller-coaster ride, and  Jack Gantos, author of the Rotten Ralph books, drags the reader along to see what life is like with ADD. The story is written from the boy's point of view in a sharp, worried style that veers out of control when Joey does. Joey's control of his own behavior slips away as we read, horrified to see this boy trying to get a grip on his life and failing. He disrupts the class field trip; he puts his finger in a pencil sharpener and injures himself; he swallows his house key. Then he runs through the classroom holding open sharp scissors. When he trips and falls, seriously injuring a classmate, he is transferred to a special-education program in another school. Here, thankfully, he encounters a caring teacher who recommends further medical evaluation, and Joey is eventually able to return to his former school. There is hope for Joey on the last page--he sits in the Big Quiet Chair to read. Gantos has achieved an unusual feat with this book. We want to turn away from Joey's shifting prison of emotions.

Niffenegger has written a soaring love story illuminated by dozens of finely observed details and scenes, and one that skates nimbly around a huge conundrum at the heart of the book: Henry De Tamble, a rather dashing librarian at the famous Newberry Library in Chicago, finds himself unavoidably whisked around in time. He disappears from a scene in, say, 1998 to find himself suddenly, usually without his clothes, which mysteriously disappear in transit, at an entirely different place 10 years earlier-or later. During one of these migrations, he drops in on beautiful teenage Clare Abshire, an heiress in a large house on the nearby Michigan peninsula, and a lifelong passion is born. The problem is that while Henry's age darts back and forth according to his location in time, Clare's moves forward in the normal manner, so the pair are often out of sync. But such is the author's tenderness with the characters, and the determinedly ungimmicky way in which she writes of their predicament [...] that the book is much more love story than fantasy. It also has a splendidly drawn cast, from Henry's violinist father [...] to Clare's odd family and a multitude of Chicago bohemian friends. [...] It is a fair tribute to her skill and sensibility to say that the book leaves a reader with an impression of life's riches and strangeness rather than of easy thrills.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

        "B0000503MO": "The third title of the Gran Turismo series takes full advantage of the new PlayStation2 game engine, which is capable of rendering about 20 million polygons per second--roughly 10 times the number of total polygons of the series' previous installment,Gran Turismo 2. Real-time lighting forces your eyes to adjust to changing conditions, such as when a car rounds a turn and the sun comes out from behind a building to cause glare on the windshield. This makes the game harder, but more realistic. Heat rises off the ground and mist swirls around vehicles as they make their way across the racetrack.Gran Turismo 3also features more than 100 distinct cars, each with different statistics, including the Subaru Impreza Rally, Dodge Viper GTS-R, and Mazda's RX-7 RS. Computer-controlled opponents benefit from enhanced artificial intelligence; they don't act like baby ducks following their mother, but instead respond to other cars, the course, and the conditions in much the same way that real drivers would. Pressure a car, and it will pressure you back; cut one off in the early part of the race, and expect to receive similar treatment down the course. They don't drive perfectly, either; some will spin out and make other mistakes over the course of a race.",
        "0060392452": "Stupid White Men, Michael Moore's screed against \"Thief-in-Chief\" George Bush's power elite, hit No. 1 at Amazon.com within days of publication. Why? It's as fulminating and crammed with infuriating facts as any right-wing bestseller, as irreverent asThe Onion, and as noisily entertaining as a wrestling smackdown. Moore offers a more interesting critique of the 2000 election than Ralph Nader'sCrashing the Party(he argued with Nader, his old boss, who sacked him), and he's serious when he advocates ousting Bush. But Moore's rage is outrageous, couched in shameless gags and madcap comedy: \"Old white men wielding martinis and wearing dickies have occupied our nation's capital.... Launch the SCUD missiles! Bring us the head of Antonin Scalia!... We are no longer [able] to hold free and fair elections. We need U.N. observers, U.N. troops.\" Moore's ideas range from on-the-money (Arafat should beat Sharon with Gandhi's nonviolent shame tactics) to over-the-top: blacks should put inflatable white dolls in their cars so racist cops will think they're chauffeurs; the ever-more-Republicanesque Democratic Party should be sued for fraud; \"no contributions toward advancing our civilization ever came out of the South [except Faulkner, Hellman, and R.J. Reynolds],\" because it's too hot to think straight there; Korean dictator Kim Jong-il \"has got to broaden himself beyond porn and John Wayne\" by watching better movies, likeDude, Where's My Car?(which contains \"all you need to know about America\").

        "0061438596": "While the Bible may be the word of God, transcribed by divinely inspired men, it does not provide a full (or even partial) account of the life of Jesus Christ. Lucky for us that Christopher Moore presents a funny, lighthearted satire of the life of Christ--from his childhood days up to his crucifixion--inLamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal. This clever novel is surely blasphemy to some, but to others it's a coming-of-age story of the highest order.Joshua (a.k.a. Jesus) knows he is unique and quite alone in his calling, but what exactly does his Father want of him? Taking liberties with ancient history, Moore works up an adventure tale as Biff and Joshua seek out the three wise men so that Joshua can better understand what he is supposed to do as Messiah. Biff, a capable sinner, tags along and gives Joshua ample opportunities to know the failings and weaknesses of being truly human. With a wit similar to Douglas Adams, Moore pulls no punches: a young Biff has the hots for Joshua's mom, Mary, which doesn't amuse Josh much: \"Don't let anyone ever tell you that the Prince of Peace never struck anyone.\" And the origin of the Easter Bunny is explained as a drunken Jesus gushes his affection for bunnies, declaring, \"Henceforth and from now on, I decree that whenever something bad happens to me, there shall be bunnies around.\"One small problem with the narrative is that Biff and Joshua often do not have distinct voices. A larger difficulty is that as the tone becomes more somber with Joshua's life drawing to its inevitable close, the one-liners, though not as numerous, seem forced. True to form,Lambkeeps the story of Joshua light, even after its darkest moments.--Michael Ferch--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

The affair in question involves Maurice Bendrix, a solipsistic novelist, and a dutifully married woman, Sarah Miles. The lovers meet at a party thrown by Sarah's dreary civil-servant husband, and proceed to liberate each other from boredom and routine unhappiness. Reflecting on the ebullient beginnings of their romance,  Bendrix recalls: \"There was never any question in those days of who  wanted whom--we were together in desire.\" Indeed, the affair goes on  unchecked for several years until, during an afternoon tryst, Bendrix  goes downstairs to look for intruders in his basement and a bomb falls on  the building. Sarah rushes down to find him lying under a fallen door,  and immediately makes a deal with God, whom she has never particularly  cared for. \"I love him and I'll do anything if you'll make him  alive.... I'll give him up forever, only let him be alive with a  chance.... People can love each other without seeing each other, can't  they, they love You all their lives without seeing You.\"Bendrix, as evidenced by his ability to tell the story, is not dead,  merely unconscious, and so Sarah must keep her promise. She breaks off  the relationship without giving a reason, leaving Bendrix mystified and angry.  The only explanation he can think of is that she's left him for another  man. It isn't until years later, when he hires a private detective to  ascertain the truth, that he learns of her impassioned vow. Sarah  herself comes to  understand her move through a strange rationalization. Writing to God in her  journal, she says:You willed our separation, but he [Bendrix] willed it  too. He worked for it with his anger and his jealousy, and he worked for  it with his love. For he gave me so much love, and I gave him so much  love that soon there wasn't anything left, when we'd finished, but You.It's as though the pull toward faith were inevitable, if  incomprehensible--perhaps as punishment for her sin of adultery. In her  final years, Sarah's faith only deepens, even as she remains haunted by  the bombing and the power of her own attraction to God. Set  against the backdrop of a war-ravaged city,The End of the Affairis equally haunting as it lays forth the question of what constitutes love  in troubling, unequivocal terms.--Melanie Rehak--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

Youngest daughters Ruth Plank and Dana Dickerson, born on the same day in the same hospital, take turns narrating the struggles they face as children. Ruth feels a coldness from her mother; Dana is unsettled by her kooky parents constantly uprooting her and her brother Ray. Regardless, the Planks pay a yearly visit to the Dickersons no matter where they've ended up living. As the girls come of age, Ruth takes an interest in art, sex, and Dana's brother, Ray, with whom she later reunites, at Woodstock, in a swirl of drugs and mud. Meanwhile, Dana realizes that her desires are directed toward women and sets off to pursue agricultural studies at a university, where she meets Clarice, an assistant professor.

When an attractive male colleague, Angus Holt, convinces Nat to accompany him on a teaching assignment at a nearby prison, a sudden riot puts them both in peril. Nat finds herself desperately attempting to save the life of a guard, apparently stabbed by an inmate during the fracas. The dying man asks her to pass on his last words to his wife, but possessing knowledge of this cryptic message proves dangerous.

Here are three of the activities included in the game:Art Parts:In this Visualize activity, players must complete the sample painting by stamping the missing pieces onto an unfinished scene. When it becomes more difficult, Art Parts flips the unfinished scene sideways or flips it upside-down.Balloon Burst:In this Compute activity, players must pop balloons in rising numerical order. At its easiest, there are few balloons shown at once. On a higher difficulty level, Balloon Burst sends in more balloons, including some with negative numbers.Fast Focus:In this Identify activity, players see a distorted image that slowly returns to normal. Players must select what it is as soon as they figure it out. As it grows more difficult, Fast Focus starts with a more heavily distorted image, so it takes longer to identify what it is.How to progress through the game:When players start a new game, they'll meet the whimsical Dr. Lobe, who will suggest that they take on the Test mode challenge: playing all 15 activities that span the five brainy categories. He'll tell players how big their brain is based on how well they did and how fast they did it.

Although the book opens with a scary scene--a family is stabbed to death by \"a man named Jack&#x201D; --the story quickly moves into more child-friendly storytelling.  The sole survivor of the attack--an 18-month-old baby--escapes his crib and his house, and toddles to a nearby graveyard. Quickly recognizing that the baby is orphaned, the graveyard's ghostly residents adopt  him, name him Nobody (\"Bod\"), and allow him to live in their tomb. Taking inspiration from Kipling&#x2019;sThe Jungle Book, Gaiman describes how the toddler navigates among the headstones, asking a lot of questions and picking up the tricks of the living and the dead. In serial-like episodes, the story follows Bod's progress as he grows from baby to teen, learning life&#x2019;s lessons amid a cadre of the long-dead, ghouls, witches, intermittent human interlopers.  A pallid, nocturnal guardian named Silas ensures that Bod receives food, books, and anything else he might need from the human world.

Jerome's classic British comedy is recounted byHouse's Hugh Laurie in a marvelously entertaining performance that will bring listeners to the banks of the Thames and carry them away into a world where three men and a dog named Montmorency venture from London to Oxford one sunny day. At just two and a half hours, the journey is short but sweet as Laurie captures the essence of Jerome's touching tale. With his classic witty tone, Laurie dives headfirst into each character, offering his own take on each colorful personality. There is a subtle theatrical aspect at work here as Laurie delivers a knockout one-man show that displays his wide-ranging talent.(Aug.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Infants switched at birth, spell casting, Brownies, boggarts, dastardly villains and wizards add lively scenery and action throughout. Though a broad cast of characters threatens to become unwieldy, Sage's smooth storytelling pace and Corduner's assured, inviting voice keep things on track. Sharp listeners will have young Septimus Heap's fate (and that of Jenna, adopted by his family) figured out before recording's end, but will still enjoy the ride.

Reclusive Lucern Argeneau, a family biographer who has been classified as a paranormal romance author, is stunned when Kate C. Leever, his new editor at Roundhouse Publishing (read: Dorchester), shows up on his doorstep demanding he make a public appearance to appease his fans. After some urging from the beguiling Kate, he agrees to go to the Romantic Times convention, little knowing that he'll have to contend with adoring fans and a week full of parties and signings. Some of the plot twists verge on the absurd-such as when Luc's codpiece sticks to a tablecloth at a Renaissance ball, or when Kate fells an attacker with a pillow-and Kate's reluctance to admit her feelings for Luc because she assumes she's \"just supper\" to him is aggravating. Still, vampire lovers will find themselves laughing throughout.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

Disgraced after the truth comes to light, Kitty loses her television job. The new editor at the magazine where Kitty got her start wants to let her go, too, but Kitty manages to get a reprieve when she comes up with the perfect tribute for her recently deceased mentor, Constance, who founded the magazine and gave Kitty her big break.

        "0064408647": "Fans of Lemony Snicket's wonderful Series of Unfortunate Events won't be  surprised to find that in the sixth installment the three Baudelaire orphans'  new home proves to be something of a mixed bag. As our ever sad but helpful  narrator states, \"Although 'a mixed bag' sometimes refers to a plastic bag that  has been stirred in a bowl, more often it is used to describe a situation that  has both good parts and bad parts. An afternoon at the movie theater, for  instance, would be a mixed bag if your favorite movie were showing, but if you  had to eat gravel instead of popcorn. A trip to the zoo would be a very mixed  bag if the weather were beautiful, but all of the man-and woman-eating lions  were running around loose.\" And so it is for the bad-luck Baudelaires. Their  fancy new 71-bedroom home on 667 Dark Avenue is inhabited by Esm&eacute; Gigi  Geniveve Squalor (the city's sixth most important financial advisor), and her  kindly husband, Jerome, who doesn't like to argue. Esm&eacute; is obsessed by  the trends du jour (orphans are \"in\"), and because elevators are \"out,\" Sunny,  Violet, and Klaus have to trudge up 66 flights of stairs to reach the Squalors'  penthouse apartment. (Other unfortunate trends include pinstripe suits, aqueous  martinis--water with a faint olive-y taste--parsley soda, and ocean  decorations.)As the book begins, the Baudelaires are not only frightened in anticipation of  their next (inevitable) encounter with the evil, moneygrubbing Count Olaf but  they are also mourning the disappearance of their dear new friends fromThe Austere Academy, the  Quagmires. It doesn't take long for Olaf to show up in another of his horrific  disguises... but if he is on Dark Avenue, what has he done with the Quagmires?  Once again, the resourceful orphans use their unique talents (Violet's  inventions, Klaus's research skills, and the infant Sunny's strong teeth) in a  fruitless attempt to escape from terrible tragedy. Is there a gleam of hope for  the orphans and their new friends? Most certainly not. The only thing we can  really count on are more gloriously gloomy adventures in the seventh book,The Vile Village.

But first she must locate Dr. Anneck Swenson, a renowned gynecologist who has spent years looking at the reproductive habits of a local tribe where women can conceive well into their middle ages and beyond. Eccentric and notoriously tough, Swenson is paid to find the key to this longstanding childbearing ability by the same company for which Dr. Singh works. Yet that isn&#x2019;t their only connection: both have an overlapping professional past that Dr. Singh has long tried to forget. In finding her former mentor, Dr. Singh must face her own disappointments and regrets, along with the jungle&#x2019;s unforgiving humidity and insects, makingState of Wondera multi-layered atmospheric novel that is hard to put down. Indeed, Patchett solidifies her well-deserved place as one of today&#x2019;s master storytellers. Emotional, vivid, and a work of literature that will surely resonate with readers in the weeks and months to come,State of Wondertruly is a thing of beauty and mystery, much like the Amazon jungle itself.--Jessica ScheinAmazon Exclusive: Elizabeth Gilbert Interviews Ann PatchettElizabeth Gilbertis the author of the #1New York Timesbestseller,Eat, Pray, Love, as well as the short story collectionPilgrims&mdash;a finalist for the PEN/Hemingway Award, and winner of the 1999 John C. Zacharis First Book Award from Ploughshares. A Pushcart Prize winner and National Magazine Award-nominated journalist, she works as writer-at-large for GQ.Elizabeth Gilbert:As your close personal friend, I happen to know that you traveled to the Amazon to conduct research for this novel, and that you sort of hated the Amazon--can you share a little about that?Ann Patchett:I absolutely loved the Amazon for four days.  It was gorgeous and unfamiliar and deeply fascinating.  Unfortunately, I stayed there for ten days.  There are a lot of insects in the Amazon, a lot of mud, surprisingly few vegetables, too many snakes.  You can&rsquo;t go anywhere by yourself, which makes sense if you don&rsquo;t know the terrain, but I enjoy going places by myself.  I can see how great it would be for a very short visit, and how great it would be if you lived there and had figured out what was and wasn&rsquo;t going to kill you, but the interim length of time isn&rsquo;t great.EG:Didn't I hear that you have a sort of magical story about a friend who is also a writer, who was also once going to write a book about the Amazon? Can you share this miraculous tale? Also, is your writer friend pretty?AP:This friend of mine, who happens to be you, is gorgeous, and much taller in real life.  Yes, you were writing a novel about the Amazon, and then you decided not to write a novel about the Amazon, and then I started writing a novel about the Amazon, and later when we compared notes (your book dismissed, mine halfway finished) they had remarkably similar story lines, to the point of being eerie.   I thought this must be because it was an incredibly banal idea and we had both come up with a generic Amazon novel, but then you told me that ideas fly around looking for homes, and when the idea hadn&rsquo;t worked out with you it came to me.   If this is true I think your name should be on the cover.  It would increase sales significantly.EG:Readers of your prior work--particularly the luminousBel Canto--will be delighted to see that opera makes an appearance in this novel, as well. In fact, one of the most dramatic scenes in the book takes place at the opera. Is that a wink and a nod to loyal readers, or just an expression of your own deep and abiding musical passions?AP:It&rsquo;s a wink and a nod to Werner Herzog and his brilliant Amazon film &ldquo;Fitzcarraldo&rdquo; which opens at the opera house in Manaus where the aforementioned scene takes place.  I had very little experience with opera when I wroteBel Canto, and since then it&rsquo;s become a huge part of my life.  It was fun to write a scene set at the opera now that I know what I&rsquo;m talking about.EG:State of Wondera rollicking adventure story, full of peril and bravery and death-defying action. I personally know you to be a homebody who likes to bake muffins for neighbors. How the heck did you pull off this wildness so convincingly? Was it as invigorating to write as it is to read?AP:Ah, the life of the mind.  All the adventure I need I can dream up in my kitchen.  I love writing outside of my own experience, making imaginary worlds.  If I wrote novels based on my own life I would not be making a living at this.  I also love to write a strong plot.  I want things to happen in my books, I want to be thrilled.  I always think about Raymond Chandler.  I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m getting the phrasing wrong but the general idea is that when things get slow, bring in a man with a gun.  If you can&rsquo;t find a gun, a poison arrow works just as well.EG:The cover is a work of beauty. Authors are not always so lucky. Tell us how you managed such a miracle?AP:When I first started writing this book, I came downstairs one night and found my husband listening to &ldquo;Horowitz at Carnegie Hall&rdquo;.  The album cover has a very lush filigreed border.  I had two thoughts: first, I have an amazing husband who thankfully held onto his Horowitz LPs; second, that the album cover had the exact the feeling I wanted for my book--half jungle, half Baroque period.  When I was finished writing the novel I sent the album to my editor, who sent it to the art department.  They understood exactly what I was talking about.",

Set in the summer of 1917, Todd's excellent second mystery featuring British nurse Bess Crawford (after 2009's A Duty to the Dead) smoothly blends realistic characters with an intricate plot. When Bess accompanies Lt. Meriwether Evanson, a severe burn victim, from the Continent to England, she's surprised to spot the pilot's supposedly devoted wife, Marjorie, crying on another man's shoulder at a train station. After returning to saving lives under German fire in France, Bess is stunned to read in a newspaper that Marjorie has been stabbed to death in London. Soon after, the depressed lieutenant commits suicide by cutting his own throat. Unable to resist involving herself in the murder investigation, Bess seeks to identify Marjorie's unknown companion, the possible killer. In addition to supplying a challenging puzzle, Todd (a mother-son writing team) does a superb job of capturing the feel of the battlefield and the emotional toll taken on those waiting back home for a loved one's return.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

From Shepherd's Glen to the foggy streets of dreaded Silent Hill, Alex must face the darkest of horrors in order to find his brother. Struggling with his own grip on reality, it's here that Alex must unravel the mystery behind his nightmares, discover the truth behind his brother's disappearance, and confront the evil that takes hold of his own flesh and blood in the process.Improved GameplayFirmly steeped in the Survival-Horror genre its series has been pivotal in establishing, action inHomecomingremains based on exploration of the terrors residing in the communities surrounding Toluca lake and puzzle-solving skill as a means of surviving them. But to its credit game developer Double Helix refuses to rest on past laurels, choosing instead to include new more accessible gameplay in the hopes of gaining a new audience forHomecoming. Examples of this gameplay include:Next-Gen Visual and Spatial Features- Every sequel seeks reinvent the namesake game in their series.Homecomingdoes this in three ways, by adding the ability to toggle between a traditional third-person view and an action-oriented first-person view; by adding fully 3-D physics to the game, creating a realistic range of motion for any and all objects impacted by the player; and by adding transitions or \"Hell States\" that alter the game's physical landscape at points in the game both in real-time and via cinematics. All three actively change the way players see themselves and in the process create a whole new game experience.An Enhanced Combat System- Adding to the standard knives, axes, pipes and other melee weapons that made up the arsenal of previousSilent Hillgames,Homecomingadds a wide variety of guns and explosives. Fitting with the military back-story of protagonist Alex Shephard, these weapons can be wielded in attacks weighted as weak or strong and can be strung together in combos to stun or incapacitate opponents, who can then be taken out with powerful finishing moves. With practice players can even perform evasive ducks and rolls and follow these up with counterattacks. But remember that enemy AI has also been significantly improved to compensate for your higher degree of combat prowess, and that it's not uncommon to battle multiple monsters simultaneously.Key Features:Enter the next chapter ofSilent Hillas you delve deeper in the tormented history of the town and learn of the evil that surrounds Toluca Lake.Silent Hill: Homecomingis the 1stSilent Hillgame designed for PlayStation 3.From the murky fog to the ominous shadows, all-new next-gen graphics bringSilent Hillto life like never before.Survive the denizens ofSilent Hillwith an all-new enhanced combat system that gives you a wide array of attacks and counters.Solve the treacherous and deadly puzzles of Silent Hill to discover its darkest secrets.Silent Hill: Homecomingwill feature an all-new soundtrack by acclaimed series composer Akira Yamaoka.Exceptional Replay ValueAlthough Alex Shepherd is the only playable character inSilent Hill: Homecomingthere are many other important characters--some returning from earlier games in the series--that can have a dramatic impact on the game. When interacting with these, players are given a choice in how to proceed via dialog trees. Will you take the short route letting only the search for your brother guide you or will you explore the nooks and crannies that make up the mystery ofSilent Hillhidden in the small talk you share with non-playable characters?

        "0060838574": "As true crime books go, this addition to the Scott and Laci Peterson library isn't particularly riveting, salacious or revealing, which is strange considering Bird's unique perspective. Adopted as a child, Bird reunited with her birth mother, Jackie Peterson, Scott's mother, in late 1997. Bird takes every opportunity to stress that she grew very close to the Peterson family, but there's very little evidence of this apart from Bird's own assertions. The reader learns tidbits about Scott and Laci: i.e., Laci loved flowers, and Scott \"was a real charmer, the kind of guy who lights up a room.\" But such details hover on the surface. In fact, this book reveals more about the author's self-delusional behavior than the crime itself. Laci's abduction occurs early on, and for the rest of the book, Bird relates how, despite all evidence to the contrary, she refused to believe her brother could be guilty. Her denial is such that, after Scott's arrest, Bird writes letters to him in which she replaces the word \"jail\" with \"camp.\" Despite Bird's frequent protestations, one wonders if she isn't disingenuous at times. She professes her love for her birth mother, for example, yet paints her in an unflattering light (\"I was beginning to understand why Jackie was so critical of Laci. No one was good enough for her golden boy\"). With the help of a therapist, Bird finally accepts the evidence and devises her list of 33 reasons why her brother is guilty. This list-which takes up a mere five pages and offers such banal reasons as Scott \"flirted with our babysitter\"-is just as superficial as the rest of the book.

        "006212532X": "Filled with explosive new information, this is the definitive inside story of the case that captivated the nation and the verdict that no one saw comingIt was the trial that stunned America, the verdict that shocked us all. On July 5, 2011, nearly three years after her initial arrest, Casey Anthony walked away, virtually scot-free, from one of the most sensational murder trials of all time. She'd been accused of killing her daughter, Caylee, but the trial only left behind more questions: Was she actually innocent? What really happened to Caylee? Was this what justice really looked like?InImperfect Justice, prosecutor Jeff Ashton, one of the principal players in the case's drama, sheds light on those questions and much more, telling the behind-the-scenes story of the investigation, the trial, and the now-infamous verdict. Providing an inside account of the case, Ashton, a career prosecutor for the state of Florida, goes where the press and pundits have only speculated, detailing what really happened during the investigation, showing how the prosecution built their case, and explaining how a woman so shrouded in suspicion was proclaimed innocent.Moving beyond the simple explanations, Ashton offers an in-depth look at the complex figure of Casey Anthony, a woman whose lies he spent three years trying to understand. And yet this focus on Casey came with its own risks; here he details how this widespread fixation on Casey&#8212;both in the media and in the trial&#8212;may have undermined the case itself. As everyone got caught up in the quest to understand the supposed villain, somehow the victim, Caylee, was all but forgotten&#8212;not just to the public, but more important, to the jury.Complete with never-before-revealed information about the case and the accused, Ashton examines what the prosecution got right, what they got wrong, and why he remains completely convinced of Casey Anthony's guilt.",

Twelve-year-old Addie admires her older sister Meryl, who aspires to rid the kingdom of Bamarre of gryphons, specters, and ogres. Addie, on the other hand, is fearful even of spiders and depends on Meryl for courage and protection. Waving her sword Bloodbiter, the older girl declaims in the garden from the heroic epic of Drualt to a thrilled audience of Addie, their governess, and the young sorcerer Rhys. But when Meryl falls ill with the dreaded Gray Death, Addie must gather her courage and set off alone on a quest to find the cure and save her beloved sister. Addie takes the seven-league boots and magic spyglass left to her by her mother and the enchanted tablecloth and cloak given to her by Rhys--along with a shy declaration of his love.

Feisty, red-haired Samantha, a self-described \"urban rebel\" who has dyed all of her clothes black, is a 15-year-old middle child, uncomfortably wedged between her popular, cheerleader older sister, Lucy, and her brainy 11-year-old sister, Rebecca. And she has a major crush on Jack, Lucy's nonconformistartist boyfriend, whom she feels is far better suited to her than to her rather vacuous sister. The entertainingly opinionated narrator's wry top-10 lists add considerably to the tale's charm and speedy pacing, among them, the \"top ten reasons why I can't stand my sister Lucy\" and the \"top ten signs that Jack loves me and not my sister Lucy and just hasn't realized it yet.\" Sam's life suddenly changes dramatically when, while standing on the sidewalk one afternoon, she foils an attempt to assassinate the President. She becomes a national hero overnight, is named teen ambassador to the United Nations and eventually lands the president's son as her beau. Despite these rather unlikely plot twists (in a comic coincidence, the president's son also happens to be a fellow student in her art class whom she finds attractive), Sam's spunky and intermittently affecting narrative, as well as the true-to-life voices of the supporting cast of characters, make this a convincing and diverting tale.

Gilbert and Eleanor Kraus were typical members of an affluent, educated Jewish community in Philadelphia in the 1930s; Gilbert was a lawyer, and Eleanor a bit of a shopaholic. Worried about what they were hearing from Europe by 1939, the Krauses set out to travel to Austria and Germany to save Jewish children from the advancing Nazis; they were not particularly religious or political and this was not an easy task in an era plagued by anti-Semitism and isolationism.  But through careful readings of the law, loopholes in the visa-granting system, and plain old bravery, the Krauses managed to bring more than four dozen children to safety in the United States.  Pressman, the Krauses&#x2019; grandson-in-law, used Eleanor Kraus&#x2019;s unpublished diaries as well as photographs, documents, and interviews  to recreate a historical moment and a heroic act. Like Oskar Schindler and his list, the Krauses and their 50 children will now never be forgotten.--Sara Nelson",

        "0061231428": "Guest Review: Steve Berry onAltar of Edenby James RollinsI first started to hate James Rollins in 1999.  That was when I picked up a paperback original calledSubterranean, Rollins' first book.   While I was struggling even to write a manuscript, this veterinarian out in California had actually done it and sold the thing.  I hated him.  Over the next few years, I would wander into a bookstore and discover that the 'vet from Sacramento' had written more stories.  I read them all, titles likeIce Hunt,Amazonia, andExcavationand hated him even more.  There I was, struggling to get published, and this guy had found the big time.I finally made it to print in 2003 and, sure enough, who's my chief competition?  You got it.  James Rollins.  The guy creates Sigma Force and writes  oneNew York Timesbestseller after another.  Titles likeMap of Bones,Black Order,The Last Oracle, andThe Judas Strain.   Amazingly, while this string of Rollins' books flooded bookstores, I managed to eke out some modest success.  But every time things started going right, here came that 'vet from California' again with another book.Occasionally, I'm asked to provide a quote or two for someone else's book.  I can't tell you how many times my words of praise languish on the back cover while Rollins' is front and center.  Rollins.  Rollins.  Rollins.  That's all I hear.  Even on Amazon, in the section titled \"Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought,\" ON MY BOOK PAGES, there's always a Rollins cover or two staring back at me from the screen.And, if things weren't bad enough, the 'vet from California' wrote another series.  Some character calledJake Ransom and The Skull King's Shadow.   It's not enough Rollins is everywhere in adult fiction (taking up valuable spots on the bestseller lists), now he has to claim a piece of the young adult pie, too.  I read that he's going to write more of those things.  Apparently, the first one did okay.  Like that was a big surprise.Which brings us toAltar of Eden, Rollins' latest concoction. Here he goes again, not satisfied with a thriller out in the summer, he has to publish another in the winter.  Which, by the way, directly competes with me (of course, Rollins doesn't care).  This new book has it all.   A savvy veterinarian (like that was a stretch), genetic engineering on long extinct animals (which was fascinating, I have to admit), fractal science (whatever that is), biological warfare (in ways you've never seen before), and mach-speed mayhem.   The thing is drum-tight in its execution.  Does this guy have herbs that stimulate his imagination in some amazing way?  I readAltar of Edenin two sittings (yeah, it's that good) and, when finished, I promptly hurled the book across the room.  It landed on the shelf where all of Rollins' other tomes stand, each sheathed in plastic, first editions, and, of course, signed (for which he charged me $5.00 a piece, cash.  He wouldn't take my check).'Oh, the humanity.'I barely bang out a-book-a-year and Rollins writes three.All of them great.Like I said, I hate this guy.Which is too bad, because he's not only a terrific writer but also a close friend.",

In this world, Helen and her demigod cousins are descended from one of Four Houses, and the Furies make them all enemies of one another. Despite the fact that Helen and Lucas were from enemy Houses and wanted to kill each other in Starcrossed, they fell in love and then discovered that they were first cousins. Now, they're finding it hard to resist their mutual attration, despite knowing its wrong. Then Orion shows up to rival Lucas for Helen's affections. Helen can fly and throw lightning bolts but makes mistakes and, like all the Gods, is guilty of hubris. She finds herself in horrific situations and the only way she can end each night so she can wake up to try again is to die - by quicksand, falling, etc.-and this is taking a terrible physical toll on her. The violence that the Gods and demigods inflict upon one another is compelling, but also brutal. Enough of the events from Starcrossed are recounted that it's not essential to have read it first. Unfinished events in this book guarantee another installment in this series that's loosely based on the Helen of Troy myth.

Jealous of Neil, a mortal, because Alice loves him, Apollo schemes to bring about Alice's demise, but his sister Artemis won't let dead mortals lie. Needing a hero for a journey, she enlists the timid Neil to go into Hades and recover Alice (and save the world while he's at it). Phillips's tale is a delightful flight of fancy into the world of what would the Greek gods do that is adequately abridged, though listeners may want to hear the full extent of the characters' exploits. Tom Sellwood delivers in an English accent that works well with the setting. He ably projects the various gods' and goddesses' personas through their dialogue, so Apollo's arrogance is heard as well as Ares' more aggressive personality.

Set in the Missouri Ozarks during the Civil War, Jiles's story focuses on the trying times of 18-year-old heroine Adair Colley. When a group of renegade Union militiamen attacks the Colley home, stealing family possessions, burning everything down, and taking away her father--an apolitical judge--Adair  gathers the remnants of her clothes and mounts a rescue effort.  Unfortunately, she is falsely accused of being a Confederate spy, a charge  that lands her in a squalid women's prison run by a decent commandant  embarrassed by his post. After he helps her escape, the two agree to seek out  one another after the war; their separate, harrowing journeys and the  evolution of each character throughout make for breathtaking action and  powerful writing. Each chapter ofEnemy Womenbegins with excerpts from  historical testimony about this terrible period in the Civil War, when marauding soldiers pillaged and murdered whole families and communities at will.

Featuring a pair of wacky robots in a quest to save the universe,Ratchet and Clankmay offer the same old basic platform scenario--run around, elude or destroy enemies, jump, and negotiate treacherously dynamic environments--but it has a number of things going for it that place it among the best titles ever in this genre.The feature that will strike you first is the terrific art direction. Set in a science fiction future, the game has a beautifully executed retro cartoon look (think old Warner Bros.). The attention lavished on every detail, from architecture to character design, makes for a world that feels complete and real. This extends to the cutscenes, which feature a variety of colorful characters given vivid life with excellent voice acting. Then there is the sheer size and level of interactivity of the environments. For me, a particularly stunning moment was when my character was knocked off a skyscraper, but instead of perishing, landed on a ledge and was able to seamlessly navigate to a whole separate section of the game. Another moment of truth came when I aimed my blaster at one of the vehicles whizzing by in the sky. These vehicles were just pretty wallpaper, I thought, but no, the thing blew up. In fact, nearly everything you see is destructible or responsive in some way: you can jump up trees, scuttle over walkways, smash boxes, and climb up ledges. And the control scheme is just complex enough to keep things interesting with multiple weapons and the like, without being bogged down by too many features.While the routine of finding and destroying enemy robots may get tedious after a while,Ratchet and Clankkeeps things interesting with the many metamorphoses of Clank (who takes on forms that surprise even himself), cool weapons like the Glove of Doom (which unleashes armies of tiny Clanks), and shifting first-robot, third-robot points of view.If this game doesn't become the bestselling platform action game of the year, it will prove that nostalgia for old characters, marketing hype, and brand loyalty really are more important than quality.--David Stoesz",

Miss Katherine Daltry, on the shelf at 23, manages the household of her ungrateful stepmother and silly stepsister, who inherited all of her father's estate. Kate is thrust from the cinders to the spotlight when her stepsister needs a stand-in for a betrothal ball at Pomeroy Castle. Gabriel, youngest princeling of the duchy of Warl-Marburg-Baalsfeld, needs a rich wife to support his archeology habit; Kate is, of course, manifestly unsuitable. Eccentric turns from Professor Biggitstiff, a pickle-eating dog, and an irrepressible godmother spin a candy floss comic romp around a core of heartache.

Vee has an inexplicable ability; when falling into what appears to be a narcoleptic state, she is really &#x201C;sliding&#x201D; into the mind of someone else&#x2014;watching events through their eyes. The mere touch of an object can trigger an episode, and they seem to be getting more frequent and more intense. When she slides into the mind of a murderer who has killed a friend and made it look like a suicide, Vee tries to channel her ability to solve the crime without revealing how she knows the truth. The story is intriguing and provides just enough information for the reader to piece together the mystery alongside Vee. The characters are well developed, with the exception of the murderer, whose motive, while believable, is not executed well enough to lift the climax above melodrama. Still, the novel is difficult to put down. While Vee&#x2019;s questions about sliding remain unanswered, the knowledge that she can live with who she is may be the greatest truth uncovered.

        "0062130145": "Within the brightness of Arclight, people are safe, but beyond the perimeter of artificial light, the world is dark and inhabited by frightening beings known as Fades. No one from Arclight has survived an encounter with the Fade, except one teenage girl: Marina. Marina has no memory of her life before Arclight, and she is filled with guilt over the people who died attempting to rescue her, particularly the father of an enigmatic young man, Tobin. After it becomes clear that Marina has a strong but inexplicable connection to the Fade, she and Tobin enter dangerous dark territory to discover the truth. Told in the present tense, the episodic story relies on occasionally contrived dialogue to fill in past events that Marina cannot remember, and readers may grow frustrated as they must wait, along with Marina, to gradually understand how events connect.

        "006085880X": "Teenage suicide is the provocative topic that Picoult plumbs, with mixed results, in her fifth novel. Popular high-school swimming star Chris Harte and talented artist Em Gold bonded as infants; their parents have been next-door neighbors and best friends for 18 years. When they fall in love, everyone is ecstatic. Everyone, it turns out, except for Em, who finds that sex with Chris feels almost incestuous. Her emotional turmoil, compounded by pregnancy, which she keeps secret, leads to depression, despair and a desire for suicide, and she insists that Chris prove his love by pulling the trigger. The gun is fired in the first paragraph, and so the book opens with a jolt of adrenaline. But Picoult stumbles in delineating both sets of parents' responses to the tragedy. Unconvincing behavior and dialogue inappropriate to the situation (plus, most importantly, the fact that the parents fail to discuss crucial topics) never touch the essence of bereavement and thus destroy credibility. Picoult redeems herself in flashbacks that reveal the two marital relationships and the personalities of both couples; and she sensitively explores the question of how well parents can ever know their children. After Chris is accused of murder and jailed, the narrative acquires impressive authenticity and suspense, with even the minor characters evoked with Picoult's keen eye for telling detail. The courtroom scenes (reminiscent of Picoult's 1996 novel, Mercy), are taut and well paced. Readers may remain unconvinced, however, that an intelligent young man like Chris would not have sought some help rather than respond to his lover's desperate request.

        "B0000TSRA6": "The virus has spread online, and Resident Evil's gameplay has never been so infectious. Fighting for life with three human-controlled characters at your side definitely adds an element of unfamiliarity to the survival horror mix, but make no mistake, this is still Resident Evil. Whether you find yourself jumping out of your seat as a zombie crashes through a window, marveling at the action in the cutscenes, or complaining about the stiffness of control and awkwardly placed camera angles, this is just another trip to Raccoon City. Only this time, you're with friends.I really have to hand it to Capcom for making teamwork the cornerstone of gameplay. In every room that you reach, this game hammers home the message that you have to stick together and work as a group. When jumping from one rooftop to another, you may misjudge the distance and fall short. Thankfully, a teammate can pull you up.Even before the game commences, you'll find yourself coordinating tactics with your soon-to-be companions at the character selection screen. In a similar vein to an RPG, each of the eight playable characters that you can select brings completely different abilities to the table that you must factor in. Do you bring a lock-picker? Someone with extra inventory spots? Or rely on firepower with a weapons expert?Unlike the other games in the series, zombies can pass from room to room and are often found in packs. Taking this newfound hunting prowess into account, Capcom has implemented a handful of new techniques that players can use to survive. You can slide under beds, hide in lockers, and even repel a zombie attack by forcing their head away from your neck with enough breathing room to raise your pistol and shoot them directly between the eyes. You'll even find strategy in the reloading of weapons. For instance, a box of shells takes more time to load than a clip. As annoying as it is to watch your character get munched because he couldn't load the rounds quick enough, I really like this aspect. It makes you keep an eye on every little detail.Where Outbreak excels in engrossing multiplayer and creative gameplay, the overall design of the game is very odd. Rather than creating one lengthy quest that players can really sink their teeth into, Capcom opted to break up the game into five separate scenarios that are roughly 45 minutes each. If you die, you'll turn into a zombie for a brief extent (and yes, you can attack your teammates if you like), then will be dropped out of the game. Sadly, you can't re-spawn. You either have to wait for your friends to finish up, or find another game to enter. While scripted controller commands are offered, it doesn't support voice chat at all or keyboard functionality in-game. Someone's head should roll for this!All told, this is a surprisingly enjoyable online venture that showcases some amazing gameplay concepts, yet a lack of foresight in the delivery of multiplayer.Concept:A highly creative, yet slightly flawed approach to multiplayer survival horrorGraphics:Not as lavish as the recent GameCube releases, yet impressive nonethelessSound:Great ambiance, but it sure would be nice to communicate with other players. Where's the voice chat?!Playability:Familiar RE controls with innovative teammate techniques and newfound environment interactionEntertainment:Entertaining, yet lacking all the elements that would keep you hookedReplay:Moderately LowRated:7.5 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:May 20042nd Opinion:Why isn't there voice chat in Resident Evil: Outbreak? For the love of all that is holy, I want to give this game a good score for its thoughtful level design, nice graphics, intense gameplay, and smart mission structure&nbsp;&#8211; but that missing headset support throws the whole experience out of whack. These levels are fast-paced and frantic, almost like an FPS, and what you want is to make some sort of strategy. This just isn't possible with the canned commands available, as \"You two check out the locker room and we're going to search the owner's office. Meet back here and we'll go up to the 3rd floor,\" weirdly isn't mapped to the right analog stick. So, this game gets the backhanded compliment of being \"high concept\" like Crystal Chronicles and Steel Battalion, for example. My ideal setup is playing this game with four friends, four TVs, and four PS2s all in the same room. Get this setup, and the game is a real gem.Rated:8 out of 10Editor:Lisa MasonSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review",

As a result not only has the Earth split into distinct sections, so has Sonic. Now he is two beings. During the day he is the usual speed-addicted hedgehog players will remember, but at night he becomes Sonic the Werehog. In either form it is the player's ultimate goal to find the missing chaos emeralds and return them to their proper place in order to set the world and Sonic himself, back the way he should be.Gameplay: The Two Sides of SonicLike nearly allSonicgames,Sonic Unleashedis platform-based. The game combines the feel of 2D side-scrolling that fans of theSonicseries love, with sharp 3D graphics, and throws in an over the back third-person perspective reminiscent of FPS gameplay for good measure. And just as in earlier games, as players race through and explore the expansive world before them, using auto lock to hone in on enemies and areas of interest, they will rely on the power they gain from the rings they collect for a variety of things, but with the new twist of Sonic's split personality, things are a little bit different.Playing during the day, as you race across the world in the form of Sonic, speed is the main goal. Collecting rings fills you with 'Ring Energy,' which not only provides extra life, but also the advantage of 'Sonic Boost.' With this players can travel at speeds that approximate 300 MPH. In addition,Sonic Unleashedintroduces two new features: the 'Speed Drift' and the 'Quick Step'. Speed Drifting is similar to drifting in racing games, allowing players to slide around corners at high speeds, while Quick Stepping is a sidestepping maneuver allowing Sonic to avoid enemies with quick steps to either side. Both keep you moving as fast as possible, so you can get as many rings as possible, which again keeps you moving as fast as possible.As night falls and Sonic assumes his Werehog form the rings provide a different kind of power more suited to his more menacing appearance. Much slower, but also much more powerful, the Werehog relies on the rings to provide life as well as strength to shield himself from the attacks of enemies. This is necessary because Werehog gameplay, although based in platforming, incorporates significant levels of combat as well. Red orbs gathered as enemies are defeated allow the player to unlock additional combo moves that will supplement the hack and slash and arm stretching abilities that the Werehog always possesses. Whether Hedgehog or Werehog, no matter which form players prefer they will get ample opportunity to explore the two sides of Sonic since each area in the game contains both night and day segments where each form must be played.Key Game Features:Sonic&rsquo;s World Transformed- Sonic maintains his high-speed abilities during the day, but at night he is transformed into a mysterious dark form with incredible never-before-seen abilities including 3D-action brawling and amazing agility.Tight Navigation and Speed Control- Players accelerate to super speed with &lsquo;Sonic Boost&rsquo; by collecting rings to increase Sonic&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ring Energy.&rsquo; Using &lsquo;Quick Step,&rsquo; players will quickly move left or right to avoid obstacles instantly. Additionally, &lsquo;Speed Drift&rsquo; allows players to rocket through turns without slowing down.Powerful New Engine and Cinematic Graphics- With its new modified game engine,Sonic Unleashedenhances the classic 2D perspective with mind-blowing 3D stages. Other technology capabilities include global illumination, grid computing, continuous data streaming and an intricate path finding system.Enhanced and Expanded Environments- Many unique and fascinating continents offer the player an opportunity to save the world in a dynamic, high-speed experience. In addition to exploring exciting unlockable areas, players dash through up to nine locations resembling real-life destinations including the Great Wall of China, Arctic Pole glaciers and many more.Whether it's the updated graphics that retain the side-scrolling feel of classic games in theSonicfranchise, an expansive world to race through and explore or the multiple and new ways to play,Sonic Unleashedoffers something for players of any age or level of ability.",
        "0061659223": "Gr 9 Up&ndash;This title, the penultimate installment of the series, focuses on Ani, daughter of Gabriel, the leader of the Dark Court's Wild Hunt; and Devlin, brother of Sorcha, the Queen of the High Court, as the faerie world tips closer to the brink of war. Bananach wants to kill Ani, and Devlin has been secretly protecting her since she was a child. When Ani's and Devlin's paths finally cross, they feel an instant attraction, which pits Bananach and Devlin against each other. Meanwhile Sorcha pines for Seth while he spends six months of the year in the mortal world as a faerie trying to rekindle his relationship with Aislinn. Since each book in the series focuses on a different main character, the cast has gotten somewhat large and confusing. Once readers have gotten reacclimatized to Marr's faerie world, though, they will find that the story moves at a rapid pace. Ani and Devlin are fully fleshed-out characters, and their attraction to one another is believable. While the author's world-building is fairly solid, the fact that time runs six times faster in faerie than it does in the mortal world (as established in Fragile Eternity) is never addressed in this book. However, this is a worthy addition to a fine series. Readers who have enjoyed the early books will find this a satisfying read, and will be eager for the series conclusion.Kristin Anderson, Columbus Metropolitan Library System, OH&copy; Copyright 2010.

But if his cyberpunk classic was big,Cryptonomiconis huge... gargantuan... massive, not just in size (a hefty 918 pages including appendices) but in scope and appeal. It's the hip, readable heir toGravity's Rainbowandthe Illuminatus trilogy. And it's only the first of a proposed series--for more information, readour interview with Stephenson.Cryptonomiconzooms all over the world, careening conspiratorially back and forth between two time periods--World War II and the present. Our 1940s heroes are the brilliant mathematician Lawrence Waterhouse, cryptanalyst extraordinaire, and gung ho, morphine-addicted marine Bobby Shaftoe. They're part of Detachment 2702, an Allied group trying to break Axis communication codes while simultaneously preventing the enemy from figuring out that their codes have been broken. Their job boils down to layer upon layer of deception. Dr. Alan Turing is also a member of 2702, and he explains the unit's strange workings to Waterhouse. \"When we want to sink a convoy, we send out an observation plane first.... Of course, to observe is not itsrealduty--we already know exactly where the convoy is. Itsrealduty isto be observed.... Then, when we come round and sink them, the Germans will not find it suspicious.\"All of this secrecy resonates in the present-day story line, in which the grandchildren of the WWII heroes--inimitable programming geek Randy Waterhouse and the lovely and powerful Amy Shaftoe--team up to help create an offshore data haven in Southeast Asia and maybe uncover some gold once destined for Nazi coffers. To top off the paranoiac tone of the book, the mysterious Enoch Root, key member of Detachment 2702 and theSocietas Eruditorum, pops up with an unbreakable encryption scheme left over from WWII to befuddle the 1990s protagonists with conspiratorial ties.Cryptonomiconis vintage Stephenson from start to finish: short on plot, but long on detail so precise it's exhausting. Every page has a math problem, a quotable in-joke, an amazing idea, or a bit of sharp prose.Cryptonomiconis also packed with truly weird characters, funky tech, and crypto--all the crypto you'll ever need, in fact, not to mention all the computer jargon of the moment.

The inclusion of subtitle \"Origins\" in the game's title refers to the six unique origin stories available to new heroes as a new game begins.

The game features three character classes--warrior, mage, and rogue--and three races of being--Human, Elf or Dwarf--that can assume these classes.

Players can also quest alone if they so choose, but with the chance of survival are slim. Convincing NPCs to join you, and treating them well may be necessary depending on the varying sentiments between the player and the NPC, or between the NPC's in the party based on the chosen history written into the origin story accepted at the beginning of the game. This uncertainty allows for a variety of possible dynamics within the party ranging from open hostility, all the way to romance. The game progresses in real-time via a pause-and-play tactical combat system that allows the player to check inventory levels, equip a character, etc. in a slight vacuum.

        "0061578916": "Book Description\"The greatest writer of historical adventures today\" (Washington Post) tackles his richest, most thrilling subject yet--the heroic tale of Agincourt.Young Nicholas Hook is dogged by a cursed past--haunted by what he has failed to do and banished for what he has done. A wanted man in England, he is driven to fight as a mercenary archer in France, where he finds two things he can love: his instincts as a fighting man, and a girl in trouble. Together they survive the notorious massacre at Soissons, an event that shocks all Christendom. With no options left, Hook heads home to England, where his capture means certain death. Instead he is discovered by the young King of England--Henry V himself--and by royal command he takes up the longbow again and dons the cross of Saint George. Hook returns to France as part of the superb army Henry leads in his quest to claim the French crown. But after the English campaign suffers devastating early losses, it becomes clear that Hook and his fellow archers are their king's last resort in a desperate fight against an enemy more daunting than they could ever have imagined.One of the most dramatic victories in British history, the battle of Agincourt--immortalized by Shakespeare inHenry V--pitted undermanned and overwhelmed English forces against a French army determined to keep their crown out of Henry's hands. Here Bernard Cornwell resurrects the legend of the battle and the \"band of brothers\" who fought it on October 25, 1415. An epic of redemption,Agincourtfollows a commoner, a king, and a nation's entire army on an improbable mission to test the will of God and reclaim what is rightfully theirs. From the disasters at the siege of Harfleur to the horrors of the field of Agincourt, this exhilarating story of survival and slaughter is at once a brilliant work of history and a triumph of imagination&#8212;Bernard Cornwell at his best.Historical Notes onAgincourtby Bernard CornwellThe battle of Agincourt (Azincourt was and remains the French spelling) was one of the most remarkable events of medieval Europe, a battle whose reputation far outranked its importance. In the long history of Anglo-French rivalry only Hastings, Waterloo, Trafalgar, and Cr&#233;cy share Agincourt&#x2019;s renown. It is arguable that Poitiers was a more significant battle and an even more complete victory, or that Verneuil was just as astonishing a triumph, and it&#x2019;s certain that Hastings, Blenheim, Victoria, Trafalgar, and Waterloo were more influential on the course of history, yet Agincourt still holds its extraordinary place in English legend. Something quite remarkable happened on 25 October 1415 (Agincourt was fought long before Christendom&#x2019;s conversion to the new-style calendar, so the modern anniversary should be on 4 November). It was something so remarkable that its fame persists almost six hundred years later.Agincourt&#x2019;s fame could just be an accident, a quirk of history reinforced by Shakespeare&#x2019;s genius, but the evidence suggests it really was a battle that sent a shock wave through Europe. For years afterward the French called 25 October 1415la malheureuse journ&#233;e(the unfortunate day). Even after they had expelled the English from France they remembered la malheureuse journ&#233;e with sadness. It had been a disaster.Yet it was so nearly a disaster for Henry V and his small, but well-equipped army. That army had sailed from Southampton Water with high hopes, the chief of which was the swift capture of Harfleur, which would be followed by a foray into the French heartland in hope, presumably, of bringing the French to battle. A victory in that battle would demonstrate, at least in the pious Henry&#x2019;s mind, God&#x2019;s support of his claim to the French throne, and might even propel him onto that throne. Such hopes were not vain when his army was intact, but the siege of Harfleur took much longer than expected and Henry&#x2019;s army was almost ruined by dysentery.The tale of the siege in the novel is, by and large, accurate, though I did take one great liberty, which was to sink a mineshaft opposite the Leure Gate. There was no such shaft, the ground would not allow it, and all the real mines were dug by the Duke of Clarence&#x2019;s forces that were assailing the eastern side of Harfleur. The French counter-mines defeated those diggings, but I wanted to give a flavor, however inadequately, of the horrors men faced in fighting beneath the earth. The defense of Harfleur was magnificent, for which much of the praise must go to Raoul de Gaucourt, one of the garrison&#x2019;s leaders. His defiance, and the long days of the siege, gave the French a chance to raise a much larger army than any they might have fielded against Henry if the siege had ended, say, in early September.Maps of the Battlefield (Click to Enlarge)England and France, 1415:One of the most dramatic victories in British history, the battle of Agincourt--immortalized by Shakespeare inHenry V--pitted undermanned and overwhelmed English forces against a French army determined to keep their crown out of Henry's hands.The French Coast:The British campaign, which started at Harfleur, ended more than two months later on 25 October at Agincourt.Harfleur:Henry's army landed in northern France on 13 August 1415 and besieged the port of Harfleur.The Battle Lines:&#x201C;We few, we happy few, we band of brothers; For he today who sheds his blood with me shall be my brother.&#x201D; &#x2013; William Shakespeare,Henry V",

His protagonist, having purchased the right to sleep on the ground-floor landing of a Bombay apartment house, slips slowly from a coma into death. As this aging alcoholic takes leave of the earth, his neighbors surround him, arguing over who gave Vishnu a few dried chapatis, who called the doctor for him, and who will pay for the ambulance to cart him away. Meanwhile, the hero ofThe Death of Vishnuis lost in memories. Drifting through increasingly vivid scenes from his past, he recalls his relatively rare snatches of love and joy--and especially his romance with Padmini, a self-involved prostitute. On one particular day, it seems, he stole one of his employer's cars and drove his love interest to the honeymoon town of Lonavala, where he showered her with gifts and finally lifted her veil to kiss her like a bride:Then the absurdity of the situation strikes him. The preposterousness of his images, the foolishness of his feelings, the comicality of chasing currents that skim across Padmini's face. He thinks how absurd this whole trip has been, how absurd is the presence of the two of them in Lonavala, how absurd is the scenery itself that stretches before them. He thinks of poor, ridiculous Mr. Jalal, waiting back in Bombay for his Fiat, and of how Padmini will react when he asks her to buy them petrol so they can get back.Vishnu also recalls his secret passion for Kavita Asrani, the beautiful teenage daughter of one of the families for whom he works. Given the protagonist's focus on his hapless love life, the scope of Suri's dazzling debut may appear narrow. However, the apartment house upon whose floor Vishnu spends his final hours functions as a microcosm of Indian society. It helps to know even a smattering about Hindu mythology or India's religious conflicts. But even if you don't, there is plenty to relish inThe Death of Vishnu, with its comical, richly drawn characters, loving attention to the details of everyday life, and provocative exploration of destiny and free will.--Regina Marler--This text refers to theHardcoveredition.",

        "0060590254": "Hilarity abounds in Moore's latest satirical gem. Sleepy Pine Cove, Calif., is abuzz with Christmas spirit, but Lena Marquez is fed up with her despicable ex-husband, Dale Pearson. On his way home from playing Santa Claus at the local lodge, Dale spies sneaky Lena uprooting his Monterey pines; he pulls a gun on her, she lashes out with a shovel and&mdash;oops!&mdash;kills him. Seven-year-old Josh Barker, thinking he's just seen the murder of Santa, prays for a miracle to save Christmas. To Lena's rescue comes Tucker Case, a slimy, reformed Casanova and DEA pilot, who gives her an alibi and sweeps her off her feet. The marijuana-cultivating town constable, Theo Crowe, suspects foul play, but Tucker intervenes with a blackmail scheme to keep the crime buried. Meanwhile, there's a new arrival in town: the glowingly blond Archangel Raziel (last seen inLamb) has come \"dirtside\" on a \"miracle mission\" involving Josh's wish and reviving the town's dearly departed. Pine Cove's biggest challenge surfaces as comically reanimated zombies begin to rise and feast on the living, and a huge El Ni&ntilde;o&ndash;induced storm swirls. This little slice of perverse Christmas cheer is enough to make even the most cynical Scrooge guffaw.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "0060529709": "The simplest thing would be to describeEverything Is Illuminated, Jonathan Safran Foer's accomplished debut, as a novel about the Holocaust. It is, but that really fails to do justice to the sheer ambition of this book. The main story is a grimly familiar one. A young Jewish American--who just happens to be called Jonathan Safran Foer--travels to the Ukraine in the hope of finding the woman who saved his grandfather from the Nazis. He is aided in his search by Alex Perchov, a na&#xEF;ve Ukrainian translator, Alex's grandfather (also called Alex), and a flatulent mongrel dog named Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. On their journey through Eastern Europe's obliterated landscape they unearth facts about the Nazi atrocities and the extent of Ukrainian complicity that have implications for Perchov as well as Safran Foer. This narrative is not, however, recounted from (the character) Jonathan Safran Foer's perspective. It is relayed through a series of letters that Alex sends to Foer. These are written in the kind of broken Russo-English normally reserved for Bond villains or Latka fromTaxi. Interspersed between these letters are fragments of a novel by Safran Foer--a wonderfully imagined, almost magical realist, account of life in the shtetl before the Nazis destroyed it. These are in turn commented on by Alex,  creating an additional metafictional angle to the tale.If all this sounds a little daunting, don't be put off; Safran Foer is an extremely funny as well as intelligent writer who combines some of the best Jewish folk yarns since Isaac Bashevis Singer with a quite heartbreaking meditation on love, friendship, and loss.--Travis Elborough, Amazon.co.uk--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",
        "B00004ZDFY": "The threat of world destruction lurks in almost all role-playing games as the inevitable consequence should the hero fail in his quest. InDarkCloud, however, the world is destroyed by a malevolent genie in the very beginning, and it's your job to put it back together. This action/RPG will require you to battle your way through dungeons to collect vital artifacts with which you'll rebuild the game's world in real-time 3-D. From there, you can view the world from above, zoom in, revolve 360 degrees around it, and, of course, explore it for more artifacts to build other parts of the world.",
        "B000084318": "TheLegend of Zeldaseries practically defined adventure gaming for an entire generation. Link, the hero of the adventure games, delighted millions by starring in games for each Nintendo console from the NES and Super NES to the Nintendo 64. Link brings this beloved franchise to the Nintendo GameCube inThe Legend Of Zelda: The Wind Waker, and he's moreanimatedthan ever.The first thing you'll notice aboutThe Legend Of Zelda: The Wind Wakeris that it looks completely different from any previous title in the franchise. Nintendo has opted to use cel-shading technology onWind Waker; the result is that the game looks like a cartoon. Die-hard Zelda purists initially howled at this change, arguing that the game skews too young. I think it's fantastic. The cartoon animation style allows for better expression of the characters, and several of the animations--like Link trying to pick up an object that's too heavy--are so cute that you can't help but laugh a little.The second thing you&#x92;ll notice is a focus on wind. Instead of trotting around on foot, Link travels from island to island on a talking boat, but he doesn't get far without the wind blowing in right direction. Luckily, you'll learn how to change the direction of the wind early in the game, and you'll do so frequently--not only to power your boat but also to solve puzzles. Clever use of wind makesWind Wakerstand out from more conventional adventure games.The third thing you&#x92;ll notice is that the game is just plain fun. Puzzles are innovative and refreshing, and despite some tricky puzzles, I never felt too frustrated to keep playing. The locales you'll visit are invariably exotic and fun to explore, and the host of bizarre creatures you'll encounter (friendly and otherwise) are always a kick in the pants. Moreover, though the look is radically different,Wind Wakerfeels like a classic Zelda game. Veterans of the early games in the franchise will experience more than a bit of nostalgia while playing it.The Legend Of Zelda: The Wind Wakeris everything you've come to expect from a Zelda game, and it's one of the best adventure games to date. This is a must-have title for any GameCube owner.--Jon \"Safety Monkey\" GroverPros:New cel-shaded animation looks greatPuzzles and characters are a lot of funThere's a special place in the heart of any gamer who's ever owned a Nintendo console, and that place is shaped like a TriforceCons:Some Zelda purists may be turned off by the cartoon look",

        "B003VJNPPE": "In BriefThe second instalment in the RPG saga about the Witcher, Geralt of Rivia, features a thoroughly engrossing, mature storyline defining new standards for thought-provoking, non-linear game narration. In addition to an epic story, the game features an original, brutal combat system that uniquely combines tactical elements with dynamic action. A new, modern game engine, responsible both for beautiful visuals and sophisticated game mechanics puts players in the most lively and believable world ever created in an RPG game. A captivating story, dynamic combat system, beautiful graphics, and everything else that made the original Witcher such a great game are now executed in a much more advanced and sophisticated way.DEVELOPER: CD Projekt REDBrief Story DescriptionAfter helping to stop the rebellion undertaken by the Order of the Flaming Rose and saving King Foltest&rsquo;s life, Geralt became one of the central figures of political turmoil in the Kingdom of Temeria. Geralt continues to protect the King in the monarch&rsquo;s mission to bring peace to his state. The last bastions of the Order yielded to the royal army. The only remaining task is to pacify the rebellious castle of Baroness La Valette, who announced separation from the Kingdom. It&rsquo;s been a month since the attempted assassination of the king, when his army arrives at the gates of Baroness La Valette&rsquo;s fortress in preparation for the final battle. In the meantime, Geralt, stuck with Foltest, cannot begin his personal quest - to discover the origin and identity of the mysterious witcher-like assassin responsible for the attempt on the king&rsquo;s life - a quest that would answer many questions...Key FeaturesA truly epic, intense, emotionally charged adventure with non-linear game narration. Three independent plot lines with several alternative events are dependent on the player&rsquo;s choices and lead to multiple different game endings and several additional plot forks. This time gameplay time will be shorter than The Witcher 1, but more intense and packed with events.A complex, realistic and mature story touching upon subject matter seldom seen in other RPGs, told in a manner that is understandable and attractive to contemporary gamers. We investigate the assassinations of the rulers of the Northern Kingdoms and follow Geralt&rsquo;s personal theme, in which he&rsquo;s looking for his own identity. Gradually we learn how powerful forces influence our situation and what role they order us to play.Rich, mature dialogue as found in Andrzej Sapkowski&rsquo;s book series and The Witcher 1, presented in highly filmic cutscenes and dialogues sequences, thanks to a new game engine.New, improved system of flashbacks. Now the reminiscences of Geralt, in which we observe the link between our past choices with current actions, are realistically and smoothly woven into the gameplay.Sex and eroticism will be introduced in a much more realistic, involving and mature way, thanks to which sexual relationships are presented more credibly than in TW1.Unique, deep, consistent and rich game world established in a series of best-selling books by A. Sapkowski and recreated in the game to provide an incredible, believable story-driven experience.Believable, true-to-life characters with their own motivations and goals. During our journey we meet ordinary men, soldiers, rebels, powerful mages, rulers and their assassins. Depending on our decisions we meet different game characters, and our relationships shape further actions in the game.Highly varied, breathtaking locations, which thanks to the new engine create a cohesive, fully accessible world!Rich, living world in which every character has their own way of life and unique occupations. Our actions modify the relationship with the game-world population and, in the case of the main plot line, open or close the possibilities of interaction with the game world.Greater freedom of exploration to provide increased game realism and a wider range of new tactical options.
