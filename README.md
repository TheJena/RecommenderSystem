Recommender System
======================

This project aims to do items recommendation in an e-commerce system.
Its major purpose is the "Gestione Avanzata dell'Informazione 2" exam
("Advanced Information Management 2" is a course about data analytics,
big data, NoSQL models, text analytics and graph analytics).

The project is composed of several scripts to:

* inspect the available data in a MongoDB
* extract the needed data from a MongoDB
* apply a collaborative-filtering / collaborative-ranking approach to the data
* apply a content-based approach to the data
* merge the recommendations of the two approaches into a single list
  of item to recommend
